gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism, and 
that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a "serviceable 
breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own". 
That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems no longer very meaningful 
to call England a "Protestant country". One of the ironies 
of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively 
speaking, many real Christians to unite.   Many English 
Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are 
in a new ascendancy. The London <Universe> devoted its centenary 
issue 
last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress 
during the last one hundred years. With traditional nationalistic spirit, 
some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism 
at its best. I have found myself saying with other foreigners here 
that English Catholics <are> good Catholics. It has been my experience 
to find as many men as women in church, and to hear almost everyone 
in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses 
at Mass.   They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-Catholic 
population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday Benediction 
they recite by heart the "Prayer for England":   "O Blessed 
Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother, 
look down in mercy upon England, thy "dowry", and upon us 
all who greatly hope and trust in thee **h. Intercede for our separated 
brethren, that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the 
chief Shepherd, the vicar of thy Son **h". A hymn often to be 
heard in Catholic churches is "Faith of our Fathers", which glories 
in England's ancient faith that endured persecution, and which 
proclaims: "Faith of our Fathers: Mary's prayers/Shall win 
our country back to thee". The English saints are widely venerated, 
quite naturally, and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs 
and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized.   Because they 
have kept the faith of their medieval fathers, English Catholics have 
always strongly resented the charge of being "un-English". I 
have not seen this charge made during my stay here, but apparently it 
is still in the air. For example, a writer in a recent number of <The 
Queen> hyperbolically states that "of the myriad imprecations the 
only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion 
that they are 'un-English'". In this connection, it has been 
observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics, priests and 
laity, in England, while certainly seen as good for Catholicism, 
is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic 
English Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to remind 
their Christian brethren of this good. ##

ONE OF THE 
more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century 
is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. 
At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics, 
partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854. Moreover, 
for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the 
city to care for their religious needs. Now, not only are there considerably 
more laity as students and professors at Oxford, but there 
are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable 
and friendly relations with the non-Catholic members of the University. 
Some Catholic priests lecture there; Catholic seminarians attend 
tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students.

Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable 
position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it 
in the mass media of England. The general tone of articles appearing 
in such important newspapers as the Manchester <Guardian> and the 
Sunday <Observer> implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic 
Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant 
churches. On successive Sundays during October, 1960, Paul Ferris 
(a non-Catholic) wrote articles in the <Observer> depicting 
clergymen of the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist 
Church. The Catholic priest, though somewhat superficially 
drawn, easily came out the best. There were many letters of strong 
protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman, who was indeed 
portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters 
and without really very much to do as clergyman. Such a series of 
articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-Victorian 
England. There was so much interest shown in this present-day 
venture that it was continued on B&B&C&, where comments were 
equally made by an Anglican parson, a Free Church minister and a Catholic 
priest.   Catholic priests have frequently appeared on 
television programs, sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal 
footing with Protestant clergymen. A notable example of this was 
the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, 
Dr& Heenan, and the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr& 
Ramsey, recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. The good 
feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now 
well known in England. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary 
has been televised several times in recent months. And it was 
interesting to observe that B&B&C&'s television film on Christmas 
Eve was <The Bells of St& Mary's>.   Of course, 
the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern 
of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr& 
Fisher, then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Vatican 
last December. It was the first time an English Primate has done 
this since the 14th century. English Catholics reacted to this event 
with moderate but real hope.   Almost daily something is reported 
which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing 
numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of 
a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic 
priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun 
had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during 
the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a 
respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still 
in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords 
in the next generation"; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen 
and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at 
a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave. 
The death of a man is unique, and yet it is universal. The straight 
line would symbolize its uniqueness, the circle its universality. But 
how can one figure symbolize both?   Christianity declares that 
in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal 
concur. Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique 
and the universal as clearly, or formulated it as precisely, as Irenaeus. 
To be the Savior and the Lord, Jesus Christ has to be a historical 
individual with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic 
aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself 
with man's history. Yet this utterly individual historical person 
must also contain within himself the common history of mankind. His 
history is his alone, yet each man must recognize his own history in 
it. His death is his alone, yet each man can see his own death in the 
crucifixion of Jesus. Each man can identify himself with the history 
and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified 
himself with human history and human death, coming as the head of a 
new humanity. Not a circle, then, nor a straight line, but a spiral 
represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has 
motion as well as recurrence. As represented by a spiral, history may, 
in some sense, be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event 
remains unique. Christ is both unique and universal.   The first 
turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam. As 
Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning, 
so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of 
Christ. "Whence, then, comes the substance of the first man? From 
God's Will and Wisdom, and from virgin earth. For 'God had 
not rained', says the Scripture, before man was made, 'and there 
was no man to till the earth'. From this earth, then, while it was 
still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man, the beginning of humanity". 
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private 
individuals, but as universal human beings, who were and are all of humanity. 
Adam and Eve were perfect, not in the sense that they possessed 
perfection, but in the sense that they were capable of development 
toward perfection. They were, in fact, children. Irenaeus does not 
claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for 
him, as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself with the 
fall. Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence 
of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity 
into history. Historical existence is a created good.   The biblical 
symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words: "So 
God created man in his own image; in the similitude of God he created 
him". There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where 
the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished, so 
most notably in the statement: "If the [Holy] Spirit is absent 
from the soul, such a man is indeed of an animal nature; and, being 
left carnal, he will be an imperfect being, possessing the image 
[of 
God] in his formation, but not receiving the similitude [of God] 
through the Spirit". Thus the image of God is that which makes 
a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude of God, by contrast, 
is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature. 
Recent research on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that 
he does not consistently maintain this distinction. He does not mean 
to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through 
the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly 
mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality. 
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows: 
"So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur, and become lifted 
up, as if he had no lord, because of the dominion that had been 
given to him, and the freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator, 
overstepping his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance 
towards God, a law was given him by God, that he might know 
that he had for lord the lord of all. And He laid down for him certain 
conditions: so that, if he kept the command of God, then he would 
always remain as he was, that is, immortal; but if he did not, he 
would become mortal, melting into earth, whence his frame had been taken". 
These conditions man did not keep, and thus he became mortal; 
yet he did not stop being human as a result. There is no justification 
for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image 
of God beyond this, nor for reading into his imprecise usage the 
later theological distinction between the image of God (humanity) and 
the similitude of God (immortality).   Man was created with the 
capacity for immortality, but the devil's promise of immortality 
in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality. He was, in the 
words of Irenaeus, "beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality". 
The true way to immortality lay through obedience, but man 
did not believe this.   "Eve was disobedient; for she did 
not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed 
a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin **h, having 
become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and 
to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed 
[to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become 
the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race". 
Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere 
potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created 
as children, Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience 
as being "due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still wicked". 
His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts 
him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin 
Mary. That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too; 
for as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue man, 
so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought 
death into the world, and all our woe.   With this act of disobedience, 
and not with the inception of his individual existence, man 
began the downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending from 
the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality. At 
the nadir of that circuit is death. "Along with the fruit they did 
also fall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience; 
and disobedience to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became 
forfeit to death, from that [moment] they were handed over to it". 
This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam 
and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, 
as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday; he sees 
a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath. In 
any case, though they had been promised immortality if they ate of 
the tree, they obtained mortality instead. The wages of sin is death. 
Man's life, originally shaped for immortality and for communion with 
God, must now be conformed to the shape of death.   Nevertheless, 
even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs 
to God, and he still rules. Even death, therefore, has a providential 
as well as a punitive function.   "Wherefore also He [God] 
drove him [man] out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree 
of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture 
to assert, but because He pitied him, [and did not desire] that 
he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin which surrounded 
him should be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable. But 
He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing death, and thus 
causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the dissolution of the 
flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at 
length to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God". This 
idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well 
into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for 
the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ. 
As man can live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that 
Christ could bring many to life.   It is probably fair to say 
that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of 
sin is. This applies to his picture of Adam. It is borne out also 
by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation 
to the next. It becomes most evident in his description of 
Christ as the second Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but 
whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality. This emphasis 
upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus 
shares with many early theologians, especially the Greek-speaking ones. 
They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility, 
which can mean (though it does not have to mean) deliverance from 
time and history.   Death reminds man of his sin, but it reminds 
him also of his transience. It represents a punishment that he knows 
he deserves, but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives 
his life within the process of time. These two aspects of death cannot 
be successfully separated, but they dare not be confused or identified. 
The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as 
altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of 
death cannot be separated. Such efforts almost always find themselves 
compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and 
then older and then still older, in short, whether Adam's life was 
intended to be part of the process of time. If it was, then it must 
have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from 
time to eternity. One night, so some of these theories run, Adam would 
have fallen asleep, much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve; 
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal. The 
embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an 
illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment, for 
some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the 
natural order of time and change.   On the other hand, Christian 
faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal 
existence. It is the wages of sin, and its sting is the law. 
If 
this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea 
of death as natural termination, the conclusion seems inevitable that 
temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state 
into which man is put by the will of the Creator. This seems to have 
been the conclusion to which Origen was forced. If death receives 
more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives 
less than its share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ 
begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal, 
i&e&, created, existence. Such an interpretation of death radically 
alters the Christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation 
from, not salvation in, time and history. Because Christianity 
teaches not only salvation in history, but salvation by the history of 
Christ, such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision 
of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ.

Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist thinking, it manifestly 
is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right 
to refuse to accept persons it dislikes. The Unitarian clergy were 
an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then understood 
in the Back Bay- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman, 
either in theology or in manners. Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable 
representative of the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the 
issue in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated 
and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force 
could exist. Even so, Gannett judiciously argued, the Association could 
legitimately decide that Parker "should not be encouraged nor 
assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard 
to their correctness". We today are not entitled to excoriate 
honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who 
barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their 
congregations. 
One can even argue- though this is a delicate matter- 
that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture 
to the First Church, and so to suppress it, rather than let Parker 
use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should 
come to occupy it. Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen, 
as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father, 
they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title 
of Christians. Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for 
intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow "free inquiry" 
to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a "natural" religion.

Grant all this- still, when modern Unitarianism and 
the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults 
Parker lavished upon them, or else argue that after all Parker 
received the treatment he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience. 
Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation 
of Parker and the fraternity on January 23, 1843- while it 
may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker 
leave the Association, while it may plead that Dr& N& L& Frothingham 
had every warrant for stating, "The difference between Trinitarians 
and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity; the difference 
between Mr& Parker and the Association is a difference 
between no Christianity and Christianity"- despite these supposed 
conclusive assurances, the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh 
of relief, of positive thanksgiving, that the Association never quite 
brought itself officially to expel Parker. Had it done so, the blot 
on its escutcheon would have remained indelible, nor could the Harvard 
Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other 
than by getting down on its collective knees and crying "peccavi".

Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association did 
not actually command Parker to leave the room, though it came too close 
for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality. Fortunately, 
the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol 
defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and Chandler 
Robbins; whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and 
rushed out of the room, though not out of the Fellowship. In the 
hall, after adjournment, Dr& Frothingham took him warmly by the 
hand 
and requested Parker to visit him- whereupon our burly Theodore 
again burst into tears.   All this near tragedy, which to us borders 
on comedy, enables us to tell the story over and over again, always 
warming ourselves with a glow of complacency. It was indeed a near 
thing, but somehow the inherent decency of New England (which we inherit) 
did triumph. Parker was never excommunicated. To the extent 
that he was ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by saying 
he asked for it. Yet, even after all these stratagems, the conscience 
of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest, any more than is 
the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance 
for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School 
Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him. In both cases 
the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant 
apostates, both legitimate offspring of its loins, and when brought 
to the test, it behaved shabbily. Suppose they both had ventured into 
realms which their colleagues thought infidel: is this the way gentlemen 
settle frank differences of opinion? Is it after all possible 
that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity 
they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any 
conservative has ever to worry about?   However, there is a crucial 
difference between the two histories. Emerson evaded the problem 
by shoving it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked 
out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick the wound of his 
departure, preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious 
veneration. Parker insisted upon <not> resigning, even when the majority 
wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to throw him 
out. Hence he was in his lifetime, as is the memory of him afterwards, 
a canker within the liberal sensitivity. He still points an accusing 
finger at all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to support 
him nor the energy to cut his throat.   Actually, the dispute 
between Parker and the society of his time, both ecclesiastical and 
social, was a real one, a bitter one. It cannot be smoothed over by 
now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or 
by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections 
to him. The fact is incontestable: that liberal world of Unitarian 
Boston <was> narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid 
of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm, 
and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle 
foundations were threatened. Parker, along with Garrison and 
Charles Sumner, showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs 
mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery. Nevertheless, 
we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace; 
their passions were genuine, and the division between them and the abolitionists 
is clear-cut. But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within 
the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository 
of liberality poses a different problem, which is not to be resolved by 
holding him up as the champion of freedom. Even though his theological 
theses have become, to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation 
he phrased is very much with us. It has been endlessly rephrased, 
but I may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves 
obliged to become intolerant? And then, as they become aware 
that they have reached the end of their patience, what do they, to 
their dismay, learn for the first time about themselves?   There 
can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel 
in enforcing its canons of behavior. The gentle Channing, revered 
by all Bostonians, orthodox or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville 
that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant 
spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and 
action: "No city in the world is governed so little by a police, 
and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment. 
We stand more in awe of one another than most people. Opinion is 
less individual or runs more into masses, and often rules with a rod 
of iron". Even more poignantly, and with the insight of a genius, 
Channing added- remember, this is Channing, not Parker!- 
that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart, should 
he "speak without book, and consequently break some law of speech, 
or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should find little mercy".

Channing wrote this- in a letter! I think it fair to 
say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons. But Theodore 
Parker, commencing his mission to the world-at-large, disguised 
as the minister of a "twenty-eighth Congregational Church" which 
bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the 
founders (among which were still the Unitarian churches), made explicit 
from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish 
society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel 
difference about clerical decorum. Because he spoke openly with what 
Channing had prophesied someone might- with daring hyperbole- Parker 
vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed 
this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals 
were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines. 
An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an 
institution, and only within those defined limits a license. 
By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation, we should, 
I am sure, come to a fresh realization, however painful it be, that the 
battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest. He 
arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had 
to respond with, at the least, resentment. What otherwise could "the 
lawyer, doctor, minister, the men of science and letters" do when 
told that they had "become the cherubim and seraphim and the three 
archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant, and continually 
cried, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Almighty 
Dollar'"? 
Nor, when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan 
stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should we be 
astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of 
rage as Parker snarled at them thus: "Talk about the Catholics 
voting as the bishop tells! reproach the Catholics for it! You 
and I do the same thing. There are a great many bishops who have never 
had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre on their head, who appeal not 
to the authority of the Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar, 
a pope much nearer home. Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists, 
lawyers and other managers, who told the editors what to say and 
the preachers what to think". This was war. Parker meant business. 
And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended 
them: "Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria, 
and are worse than those who deceived them"- which implied that they 
were very bad indeed. It was "<Duty>" he said that his parents 
had given him as a rule- beyond even the love that suffused his 
being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied- and 
it was duty he would perform, though it cost him acute pain and exhausted 
him by the age of fifty. Parker could weep- and he wept astonishingly 
often and on the slightest provocation- but the psychology of 
those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to 
massacre his opponents. "If it gave me pleasure to say hard things", 
he wrote, "I would shut up forever". We have to tell ourselves 
that when Parker spoke in this vein, he believed what he said, because 
he could continue, "But the TRUTH, which cost me bitter 
tears to say, I must speak, though it cost other tears hotter than 
fire". Because he copiously shed his own tears, and yielded himself 
up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England, 
he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's 
consciences.   Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how 
strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very 
issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its 
Christian survival, that of the literal, factual historicity of the 
miracles as reported in the Four Gospels. It is idle to ask why we 
are no longer disturbed if somebody, professing the deepest piety, 
decides anew 
that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the 
water into wine at eleven A& M& on the third of August, A& 
D& 32. We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed. So we are 
the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right 
side in an unnecessary controversy, to salute his courage, and to pass 
on, happily forgetting both him and the entire episode. We have not 
the leisure, or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was working 
in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard 
Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most 
formidable instructor, the majesterial Andrews Norton, by saying 
that, while he believed Jesus "like other religious teachers", worked 
miracles, "I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine".

I have, within the past fifty years, come out of all uncertainty 
into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about 
which I have not a shadow of doubt. It has been my lot all through 
life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with 
them the deepest and most vital of all questions, the nature of the 
hope of a life beyond this. I have also constantly engaged in scientific 
work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science 
as well as in the religions in the world. In an amateurish, yet in 
a very real sense, I have followed the developments of archaeology, geology, 
astronomy, herpetology, and mycology with a hearty appreciation 
of the advances being made in these fields.   At one time I became 
disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent 
inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a "Higher 
Criticism" of the Bible, to refute which I felt the need of a better 
knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology, for it seemed to me that 
to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.

Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while 
and, like some higher critical friends, trying to continue to use the 
Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have 
been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations: 
attempting to bridge the chasm between an older, reverent, Bible-loving 
generation and a critical, doubting, Bible-emancipated race. Although 
still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book, I 
stood outside shivering in the cold.   In one thing the higher 
critics, like the modernists, however, overreached themselves, in claiming 
that the Gospel of John was not written in John's time but 
well after the first century, perhaps as late as 150 A&D&. Now, 
if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word of God speaking 
through His servant, it is John's Gospel. To ask me to believe 
that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the 
events by some admiring follower, and was not inspired directly by the 
Spirit of God, is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any 
of those recorded in the Bible. Here I took my leave of my learned 
friends to step out on another path, to which we might give the modern 
name of Pragmatism, or the thing that works. Test it, try it, and 
if it works, accept it as a guiding principle.   So, I put my 
Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself, and 
then tested it to see how it worked. As a short, possibly not the best 
method, I looked up "Word" in the Concordance and noted that 
the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal 
message to man. The next traditional step then was to accept it 
as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would 
accept a treatise on any earthly "science", and I submitted to 
its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that, 
<"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether 
it be of God, or whether I speak of myself"> (John 7:17).

The outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance 
of the Bible as the Word of God inspired in a sense utterly 
different from any merely human book, and with it the acceptance of 
our Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God, Son of Man 
by the Virgin Mary, the Saviour of the world.   I believe, 
therefore, that we are without exception sinners, by nature alienated 
from God, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth, 
the representative Head of a new race, to die upon the cross and pay 
the penalty of the sin of the world, and that he who thus receives Christ 
as his personal Saviour is "born again" spiritually, with new 
privileges, appetites, and affections, destined to live and grow in 
His likeness forever. Nor can any man save himself by good works or 
by a commendable "moral life", although such works are the natural 
fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally 
expressing itself through such avenues.   I now ever look for 
Christ acording to His promises and those of the Old Testament as 
well, to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness 
over the whole earth.   To state fully what the Bible 
means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to 
formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and 
friends. The Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as 
bread is food for the body. Again, as faith reveals God my Father 
and Christ my Saviour, I follow without question where He leads me 
daily by His Spirit of love, wisdom, power and prayer. I place His 
precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability, dismissing 
cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed 
to Him. I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ, 
who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge, and daring to trust Him 
even though called to stand alone before the world.   Our Lord's 
invitation with its implied promise to all is, "Come and see".

I STOOD at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld 
a very sick man in terrible pain. As I ministered to his needs, 
I noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and I 
learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and 
nurse but also the Lord.   In his heart he had that peace of which 
the Lord spoke when He said, <"Peace I leave with you, my peace 
I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let 
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid">.   What 
a joy to realize that we, too, can claim this promise tendered by 
the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very 
dear to Him. He was about to leave them, to depart from this world, 
and return to His Father in Heaven. Before He left them He promised 
that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts 
and minds.   I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who 
has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. It makes 
my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance 
while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.   How 
often have I looked to Jesus when entering the sick room, asking 
for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents 
not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and 
His creatures.   Looking unto God, the Prophet Isaiah wrote 
these blessed words almost three thousand years ago: <"Thou wilt 
keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because 
he trusteth in thee">.   Are you longing for peace in your heart? 
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours. As only a member 
of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family, likewise 
one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits 
that are promised to those who are His own.   Perhaps you are 
not His child. Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him. You 
may know that you are in God's family and be just as sure of it as 
you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father. 
<"God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that 
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life",> 
and <"as many as received him, to them gave he power to become 
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name">.

It is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that 
He gives His peace; not that empty peace the world offers, but a deep, 
abiding peace which nothing can destroy.   Why not open your 
heart to the Lord Jesus Christ now, accept Him as your Saviour 
and 
let Him fill you with peace that only He can give.   Then, 
with the hymn writer of old, you can say:   "I am resting today 
in His wonderful peace,   Resting sweetly in Jesus' control.

I am kept from all danger by night and by day,   And 
His glory is flooding my soul".

SATELLITES, SPUTNIKS, ROCKETS, 
BALLOONS; what next? Our necks are stiff from gazing at 
the wonders of outer space, which have captured the imagination of the 
American public. Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth from 
the radio, television, and newspaper.   While we are filling 
outer space with scientific successes, for many the "inner" space 
of their soul is an aching void.   Proof? An average of 50 suicides 
are reported in America each day! One out of every three or 
four marriages end in divorce! Over $200,000,000 is paid yearly to 
the 80,000 full-time fortune-tellers in the United States by fearful 
mankind who want to "know" what the future holds! Delinquency, 
juvenile and adult, is at an all-time high! Further proof? Read 
your daily newspaper!   Unfortunately, in our rush to beat 
the Russians, we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus Christ: 
<"What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world> 
[that includes outer space], <and lose his own soul? Or what 
shall a man give in exchange for his soul"?> (Mark 8:36, 37).

Gaining outer space and losing "inner" space is bad business 
according to God's standards.   It is true that we must 
keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments; only 
a fool would think otherwise. But we must not forget man's soul.

Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news 
that God put His Son, 
Jesus Christ, on earth to live and die to 
save our hell-bound souls? <"For God so loved the world, that 
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should 
not perish, but have everlasting life"> (John 3:16).   Never 
forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Your spiritual 
"inner" space helps determine the spirituality of America 
as a nation. We trust you are not one of the 70,000,000 Americans 
who do not attend church, but who feel that various forms of recreation 
are more important than worshipping the God who made our country great.

Is forgiveness of past sins, assurance of present help, and 
hope of future bliss in your orbit? Or are you trying the devil's 
substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within? Pleasure, 
fame and fortune, drowning your troubles with a drink, and "living 
it up" with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry: 
they may ease your hunger temporarily, but they'll never take the 
place of a satisfying, mouth-watering steak.   So it is spiritually. 
No amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will 
relieve the gnawing of your "inner" space. Why? Because your 
soul was made to be filled with God Himself, not religious functions 
"about" Him. Only He can satisfy the deepest longings. That 
is why the Bible commands you to <"Taste and see that the Lord 
is good: blessed> [happy] <is the man that trusteth in him"> 
(Psalm 34:8).   You can receive God into your heart and life 
by a step of personal faith. Accept the sinless Son of God, Jesus 
Christ, as your own personal Saviour. <"As many as received him> 
[Jesus], <to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even 
to them that believe on his name"> 
<"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? 
the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be 
afraid"?> 
Psalm 27:1   A certain teacher scheduled a "Fear Party" 
for her fourth grade pupils. It was a session at which all the youngsters 
were told to express their fears, to get them out in the open 
where they could talk about them freely. The teacher thought it was 
so successful that she asks: "Wouldn't it be helpful to all age 
groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their 
fears and worries"?   Dr& George W& Crane, a medical 
columnist, thinks it would. He says: "That would reduce neurotic 
ailments tremendously. Each week an estimated 20 million patients call 
upon us doctors. Of this number, 50%, or 10 million patients have 
no diagnosable physical ailments whatever. They are 'worry warts'. 
Yet they keep running from one physician to another, largely to get 
a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles. One of 
the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus 
be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions".

We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to 
deal with the problem of fear these days. It must be getting more serious. 
People are giving their doctors a hard time. One doctor made 
a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles, and 
he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened; 
30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely 
beyond their control; 12% of them worried about their health, 
although their ailments were imaginary; 10% of them worried about 
their friends, neighbors, and relatives, most of whom were quite capable 
of taking care of themselves. Only 8% of the worries had behind 
them real causes which demanded attention.   Well, most of our 
fears may be unfounded, but after you discover that fact, you have something 
else to worry about: Why then do we have these fears? What 
is the real cause of them? What is there about us that makes us so 
anxious?   Look at the things we do to escape our fears and 
to forget our worries. We spend millions of dollars every year on fortune 
tellers and soothsayers. We spend billions of dollars at the race 
tracks, and more billions on other forms of gambling. We spend billions 
of dollars on liquor, and many more billions on various forms of 
escapist entertainment. We consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers 
and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions 
that are tearing us apart.   A visitor from a more peaceful 
country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks, and after 
he had seen it all, he said to a friend: "You must be a very 
sad people". "Sad" was not the right word, of course. He should 
have said "jittery", for that's what we are. And that's worse 
than sad. Watch people flock to amusement houses, cocktail lounges, 
and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment, which means 
an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed 
to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give 
men a few hours of dubious relaxation- watch them and you can tell 
that many of them are running away from something.   In one of 
his writings Pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign 
of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates. Yes, 
and as tension mounts in this world, fear is increasing. Does that 
explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business? 
We have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons, 
dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate. I doubt that 
"fear parties" and "group confessionals" will help very much. 
Suppose we do get our fears out in the open, what then? Isn't that 
where most of them are already- right out on the front page of our 
newspapers? Maybe we are talking about them too much. The question 
is: what are we going to do about them?   Meanwhile, the 
enemy will capitalize on our fears, if he can. Hitler did just that 
23 years ago, building up tensions that first led to a Munich and then 
to a world war. The fear of war can make us either too weak to stand 
and too willing to compromise, or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate 
for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate. It is 
said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals 
to attack. It could have the same effect on Communists. The President 
of the United States has said: "We will never negotiate out 
of fear, and we will never fear to negotiate". That is a sound position, 
but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely 
as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not 
afraid. And that's another reason why it is imperative for us these 
days to conquer our fears, to develop the poise that promotes peace.

Turning to the Word of God, we find the only sure way to do 
that. In Psalm 27:1 you read those beautiful words which you must 
have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you, 
or to drive them out if they have you in their grip: "The Lord 
is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the 
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid"?   Well, 
you say, those are beautiful words all right, but it was easy for the 
psalmist to sing them in his day. He didn't live in a world of perpetual 
peril like ours. He didn't know anything about the problems 
we face today.   No? Read the next two verses: "When the 
wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, 
they stumbled and fell. Though an host should encamp against me, my 
heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will 
I be confident".   That is almost a perfect description of 
the predicament in which we find ourselves today, isn't it? Our 
enemy is also threatening to devour us. He has already devoured huge 
areas of the world, putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains 
and barbed wire, reducing them to slavery, systematically crushing 
not only their bodies but their souls, and shooting them to death if they 
try to escape their prison. Yes indeed, we too can see a warlike 
host of infidels encamped against us.   What a terrible thing, that 
"wailing wall" in Berlin! A man with a baby in his arms stood 
there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest 
of the family. Another man tried to swim across the river from the East 
to the West, but was shot and killed. A middle aged woman opened 
a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall, 
she threw out a few belongings and then jumped; she was fatally injured. 
The entrance to a church has been walled up, so that the congregation, 
most of which is in the western sector, cannot worship God there 
anymore. Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends 
that live in the opposite part of the city. People stand at the wall 
giving vent to their feelings, weeping, pounding it with their fists, 
pleading for loved ones. But the enemy answers them from loudspeakers 
that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible 
profanity. There is only one escape left, a tragic one, and too 
many people are taking it: suicide. The normal rate of suicides in 
East Berlin was one a day, but since the border was closed on August 
13 it has jumped to 25 a day!   These things may be happening 
many miles away from us but really they are right next door. We are 
all involved in them, deeply involved. And nobody knows what comes next. 
We live from crisis to crisis. And there is only one way for a 
man to conquer his fears in such a world. He must learn to say with 
true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world: "The Lord 
is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the 
strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid"?

Notice 
that this man had a threefold conception of God which is the secret 
of his faith. First, "the Lord is my <light>". He lived in a 
very dark world, but he was not in the dark. The same God who called 
this world into being when He said: "Let there be light"!- 
those were His very first creative words- He began the world with 
light- this God still gives light to a world which man has plunged 
into darkness. For those who put their trust in Him He still says 
every day again: "Let there be light"! And there is light!

In fact, He came into this world Himself, in the person of 
His Son, Jesus Christ, who stood here amid the darkness of human 
sin and said: "I am the light of the world: he that followeth 
me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life". The 
psalmist could say that God was his light even though he could only 
anticipate the coming of Christ. He lived in the dawn; he could 
only see the light coming over the horizon. We live in the bright daylight 
of that great event; for us it is a fact in history. Why should 
we not have the same faith, and an even greater experience of the light 
which it gives?   This is the faith that moved the psalmist 
to add his second conception of God: "The Lord is **h my <salvation>". 
He knew that his God would save him from his enemies 
because He had saved him from his sins. If God could do that, He could 
do anything. The enemies at his gate, threatening to eat up his 
flesh, were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul. 
And God had conquered that one by His grace! So why worry about 
all the others?   The apostle Paul said the same thing in the 
language and faith of the New Testament: "He that spared not 
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with 
Him freely give us all things? **h If God be for us, who can be 
against us? **h Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? 
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, 
or peril, or sword"? (Romans 8:31, 32, 35)   Salvation! 
This is the key to 
the conquest of fear. This gets down to the heart of our problem, for 
it reconciles us with God, whom we fear most of all because we have 
sinned against Him. When that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus 
Christ, when we know that He is our Savior, that He has paid our 
debt with His blood, that He has met the demands of God's justice 
and thus has turned His wrath away- when we know that, we have peace 
with God in our hearts; and then, with this God on our side, 
we can face the whole world without fear.   And so the psalmist 
gives us one more picture of God: "The Lord is the <strength> 
of my life". The word is really "stronghold". It recalls those 
words of another psalm: "God is our refuge and strength, a very 
present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth 
be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the 
sea **h Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations He 
hath made in the earth. 
But, again, we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until 
the close of the ninth century A&D&, when an Arabic scholar, Tabit 
ibn Korra (836-901) is said to have discussed the magic square of 
three. Thus, while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or 
the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before 
the Chinese did, more definite evidence will have to turn up from 
the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her 
claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years. 

#2. THE "LO SHU" SQUARE AS AN EXPRESSION OF CENTRALITY# 

The 
concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace, strong and united under a 
forceful ruler, which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of 
the 
Warring States, was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese 
Empire under the Ch'in dynasty (221-207 B&C&). But this 
was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian 
despotism. Among the many severe measures taken by the First Emperor, 
Shih Huang-ti, in his efforts to insure the continuation of 
this hard-won national unity, was the burning of the books in 213 B&C&, 
with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for 
divergent thinking; but, as he had a special fondness for magic and 
divination, he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared. 
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn, during the burning 
of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later; yet some must have 
survived, because the old interest in number symbolism, divination, 
and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty, which succeeded in reuniting 
China and keeping it together for a longer period (from 202 B&C& 
to A&D& 220). In fact, during 
the first century B&C&, an extensive literature sprang up devoted 
to these subjects, finding its typical expression in the so-called 
"<wei> books", a number of which were specifically devoted to 
the <Lo Shu> and related numerical diagrams, especially in connection 
with divination. However, the <wei> books were also destroyed 
in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final 
proscription in 605.   After all this destruction of old literature, 
it should be obvious why we have so little information about the 
early history and development of the <Lo Shu>, which was already 
semisecret anyhow. But, in spite of all this, enough evidence remains 
to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object 
of a rather extensive cult- or series of cults- reaching fullest 
expression in the Han period.   Although modern scholars have 
expressed surprise that "the simple magic square of three", a mere 
"mathematical puzzle", was able to exert a considerable influence 
on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries, 
they could have found most of the answers right within the square 
itself. But, up to now, no one has attempted to analyze its inherent 
mathematical properties, or the numerical significance of its numbers- 
singly or in combination- and then tried to consider these in 
the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts.   Such an analysis 
speedily reveals why the middle number of the <Lo Shu>, 5, 
was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints 
that they had a knowledge of this diagram. The importance of this 
5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of 
the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the 
numbers- quite apart from any numerological considerations, which is 
to say, any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it. Indeed, mathematically 
speaking, it was both functionally and symbolically the most 
important number in the entire diagram.   If one takes the middle 
number, 5, and multiplies it by 3 (the base number of the magic 
square of three), the result is 15, which is also the constant sum of 
all the rows, columns, and two main diagonals. Then, if the middle number 
is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square, through 
multiplying it by the highest number, 9 (which is the square of 
the base number), the result is 45; and the latter is the total sum 
of all the numbers in the square, by which all the other numbers are 
overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed.   Furthermore, 
the middle number of the <Lo Shu> is not only the physical 
mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers, by reason of 
its central position; it is also their mathematical mean, since it 
is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair, all of which equal 10. 
In fact, the neat balance of these pairs, and their subtle equilibrium, 
would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese. 
For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female, 
equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature; 
and in this square, the respective pairs made up of large and 
small odd (Yang) numbers, and those composed of large and small even 
(Yin) numbers, were all equal to each other. Thus all differences were 
leveled, and all contrasts erased, in a realm of no distinction, and 
the harmonious balance of the <Lo Shu> square could effectively 
symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.

The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the <Lo Shu> square- 
for purely mathematical reasons- and the fact that this number so 
neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe, could well explain 
why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5, and 
why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality. These twin 
tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty.

The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further 
stimulated toward the close of the second century B&C&, when 
the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow- 
which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions- 
and took 5 as the dynastic number, believing that he would thus 
place himself, his imperial family, and the nation under the most auspicious 
influences. His immediate motive for doing this may not have 
been directly inspired by the <Lo Shu>, but this measure must inevitably 
have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.

After this time, inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors, as well 
as other writings, emphasized the desirability of keeping one's 
self at the center of the universe, where cosmic forces were strongest. 
Later, we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too 
literally.   All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 
5 as a symbolic expression of the Center, which seems to have begun 
as far back as 400 B&C&, also may conceivably have led to the development 
of the Five-Elements School and the subsequent efforts to 
fit everything into numerical categories of five. We find, for example, 
such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers, the Five Sacred Mountains, 
the Five Directions (with Center), the Five Metals, Five 
Colors, Five Tastes, Five Odors, Five Musical Notes, Five 
Bodily Functions, Five Viscera, and many others. This trend has 
often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself, as though 
they had served as the base for all the rest; but why did the Old 
Chinese postulate <five> elements, when the Ancient Near East- 
which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence 
in human life and activities- recognized only four? And why 
did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions, 
when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only 
the usual four? Obviously, something suddenly caused them to start 
thinking in terms of fives, and that may have been the workings of 
the <Lo Shu>.   This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect 
on Chinese thinking. Whereas the primary meanings of the <Lo Shu> 
diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties- 
and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on 
some mathematical bases- the urgent desire to place everything into 
categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers, until 
an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought. 
Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature, 
or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things, in a fashion that 
seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical, and 
philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought 
in China for many centuries. 

#3. YIN AND YANG IN THE "LO SHU" 
SQUARE#

Although the primary mathematical properties of the middle 
number at the center of the <Lo Shu>, and the interrelation 
of all the other numbers to it, might seem enough to account for the deep 
fascination which the <Lo Shu> held for the Old Chinese philosophers, 
this was actually only a beginning of wonders. For the <Lo 
Shu> square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief 
religious and philosophical ideas of its time. As such, one cannot 
fully understand the thought of the pre-Han and Han periods without 
knowing the meanings inherent in the <Lo Shu>; but, conversely, 
one cannot begin to understand the <Lo Shu> without knowing something 
about the world view of the Old Chinese, which they felt they 
saw expressed in it.   The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty, 
when the <Lo Shu> seems to have been at the height of its 
popularity, was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-Yang 
and Five-Elements School, which was traditionally founded by Tsou 
Yen. According to this doctrine, the universe was ruled by Heaven, 
<T'ien>- as a natural force, or in the personification of a Supreme 
Sky-god- governing all things by means of a process called the 
<Tao>, 
which can be roughly interpreted as "the Order of the Universe" 
or "the Universal Way". Heaven, acting through the Tao, 
expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles, 
the Yin and the Yang. The Yang, or male principle, was the source 
of light, heat, and dynamic vitality, associated with the Sun; while 
the Yin, or female principle, flourished in darkness, cold, and quiet 
inactivity, and was associated with the Moon. Together these two 
principles influenced all things, and in varying combinations they were 
present in everything.   We have already seen that odd numbers 
were considered as being Yang, while the even numbers were Yin, so 
that the eight outer numbers of the <Lo Shu> represented these two 
principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center. During 
the Han dynasty, another Yin-Yang conception was applied to the <Lo 
Shu>, considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China. Instead 
of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine 
Provinces, as was usually 
done, this equated the odd, Yang numbers 
with mountains (firm and resistant, hence Yang) and the even numbers 
with rivers (sinuous and yielding, hence Yin); taking the former 
from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from 
the principal river systems of Old China.   Thus the middle 
number, 5, represented Sung-Shan in Honan, Central China; the 
3, T'ai-Shan in Shantung, East China; the 7, Hwa-Shan in Shensi, 
West China; the 1, Heng-Shan in Hopei, North China (or 
the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi); and the 
9, Huo-Shan in Anhwei, which was then the South Sacred Mountain. 
For the rivers, the 4 represented the Huai, to the (then) Southeast; 
the 2, the San Kiang (three rivers) in the (then) Southwest; 
the 8, the Chi in the Northeast; and the 6, the (upper) Yellow River 
in the Northwest.   Note that by Western standards this 
plan was "upside down", as it put North at the bottom and South 
at the top, with the other directions correspondingly altered; but in 
this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention 
for all maps. The same arrangement was used when the <Lo Shu> was 
equated with the Nine Provinces; and whenever the <Lo Shu> 
involved directional symbolism, it was oriented in this same fashion. 
Few persons who join the Church are insincere. They earnestly desire 
to do the will of God. When they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve 
Christian stature, it is an <indictment of the Church>. These 
fatalities are dramatic evidence of "halfway evangelism", a failure 
to follow through. A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can 
end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless 
practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active 
fellowship.   The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not 
completed when all of the persons on the Responsibility List have 
been interviewed. In the average situation about one-third of those visited 
make commitments to Christ and the Church. The pastor and the 
Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee <must follow 
through> immediately with a carefully planned program. The first thirty 
to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine 
their interest and participation in the life of the Church. Neglect 
means spiritual paralysis or death. 

#PREPARATION FOR MEMBERSHIP# 

CHURCHES THAT HAVE a carefully planned program of membership preparation 
and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members 
loyal and active. This is the answer to the problem of "membership 
delinquency".   It is important that persons desiring to 
unite with the Church be <prepared> for this experience so that it 
may be meaningful and spiritually significant. It is unfair and unchristian 
to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership 
before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.

Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after 
the commitment is received. _1)_ The pastor <writes a personal letter> 
to each individual, expressing his joy over the decision, assuring 
him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time, and outlining 
the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday. 
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported 
by the visitors. It should not be postponed later than the next day. 
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter. _2)_ The pastor 
calls in the home of each individual or family for a <spiritual guidance 
conference>. If possible, he should make an appointment in order 
that all persons involved may be present. This is <not> a social 
call. It is definitely a "spiritual guidance conference". He 
will discuss the significance of Christian commitment, the necessity 
of family religion and private devotions, and the importance of the 
membership preparation sessions. There may be problems of conduct or 
questions of belief which will require his counsel. Each conference 
should be concluded naturally with prayer. A piece of devotional material, 
such as <The Upper Room>, may be left in each home. _3)_ 
A minimum of <four sessions of preparation for membership> is necessary 
for adults. Some churches require more. None should ask less. 
Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the 
meaning of Christian discipleship <before> they take the sacred 
vows. They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper 
devotion to it if membership requires something of them.   Many 
churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time 
for adult preparation classes. Others meet on Sunday night, at the 
mid-week service, or for a series of four nights. Some pastors have 
two sessions in one evening, with a refreshment period between. 
The sessions should cover four major areas: _A_- The Christian 
Faith _B_- History of the Church _C_- Duties of Church 
Membership _D_- The Local Church and Its Program

Following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing 
with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the 
week. This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership 
packet. 

#FOURTH SESSION IMPORTANT#

MOST PASTORS FIND 
that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore 
hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday. In this session 
the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the 
work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the 
local church. The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak 
on the various phases of church life, service opportunities, the church 
school, missions, men's work, women's work, youth program, social 
activities, and finances. The budget of the church may be presented 
and pledges solicited at this session. An "interest finder" or 
"talent sheet" may be filled out by each person. (See sample on 
pp& 78-79.) The fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the 
church facilities and refreshments. The social time gives an opportunity 
for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members. 

#ADDITIONAL 
SUGGESTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP PREPARATION#

IN CONDUCTING 
the Membership Preparation-Inquirers' Class, the pastor should 
plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest 
on the part of the class. The following have been found effective. 

_1)_ <Extend the number of classes>. Some churches have 
six or more training sessions of two hours each, generally held on Sunday 
night or during the week. This gives greater opportunity for the 
learning process. _2)_ <Use dramatization>- for example, in 
discussing the Lord's Supper or church symbolism. _3)_ <Use 
audio-visual aids>. Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion 
pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to 
enrich the class session. _4)_ <Have a "Question Box>". 
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly. Urge them 
to write out their questions for the box. _5)_ <Use a textbook> 
with assigned readings each week. _6)_ <Select class members for 
reports> on various phases of the study. _7)_ <Conduct examinations>, 
using a true-false check sheet. _8)_ <Ask each member 
to write a statement> on such topics as: "What Christ Means to 
Me", "What the Church Means to Me", "Why Join the Church", 
"The Duties of Church Members", etc&. _9)_ <Assign 
a series of catechism questions> to be memorized. _10)_ <Invite 
class members to share in an extra period of Bible study> each 
week. _11)_ <Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty> 
to the Reception Service. 

#WHAT ABOUT TRANSFERS?#

THERE 
IS A GROWING CONVICTION among pastors and Church leaders that 
all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory 
training, including those coming by transfer of membership. George E& 
Sweazey writes: "There is danger in trying to make admission 
to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know 
that anything has happened".   People appreciate experiences 
that demand something of them. Those who transfer their membership are 
no exception to the rule. For most of them, it will be their first 
experience in membership training, since this is a recent development 
in many churches. Those coming from other denominations will welcome 
the opportunity to become informed.   The preparatory class is 
an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted 
with one another. It provides a natural transition into the life 
of the local church and its organizations. 

#RECEPTION INTO THE CHURCH 
FELLOWSHIP#

THE TOTAL PROCESS of evangelism reaches the crescendo 
when the group of new members stands before the congregation to 
declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship 
of the Church. This should be a high moment in their lives, a 
never-to-be-forgotten 
experience. They should sense the tremendous significance 
of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our 
Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.

Every detail of the service merits careful attention- the 
hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of fellowship, the introduction 
to the congregation, the welcome of the congregation. This is 
a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation. It will help 
to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church. It 
can mean the difference between participation and inaction, spiritual 
growth and decay.   The worship service is the natural and logical 
time to receive new members into the Church. The atmosphere for 
this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the 
worship experience. Psychologically the reception should be the 
climax, following the sermon. _1)_ Ask the new members to meet thirty 
minutes before the service to complete "talent sheets" and pledge 
cards. Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the 
chronological membership register. Provide a <name card> for each 
new member. Outline plans for the entire service. _2)_ Arrange a 
reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together. 
Sponsors may sit with them also. _3)_ Invite sponsors or Fellowship 
Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service. 

_4)_ Give each new member a certificate of membership. _5)_ 
Introduce each new member to the congregation, asking him to face 
the congregation. _6)_ Lead the congregation in a response of 
welcome. _7)_ Have a reception for new members in the parlor or 
social hall immediately after the service. _8)_ Take a picture of 
the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the 
bulletin board. _9)_ Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with 
new members as guests. 

#CHAPTER 6 PLANNING FOR THE ASSIMILATION AND 
GROWTH OF NEW MEMBERS#

THE CHURCH is "the family of God". 
The members of the "family" are drawn together by a common love 
for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom. Every member 
of the family must have a vital place in its life. This is no spectator-type 
experience; everyone is to be a participant.   Yet the 
most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right 
at this point- helping new members to become participating, growing 
parts of the fellowship. Very easily they may be neglected and eventually 
join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.   A study 
of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period 
revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who 
joined the Church were <lost to the Church within seven years>. One 
denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the 
period under study, and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991- 
a net growth of only 122,158. Yet during the same period there 
were 1,080,062 additions. Another major church body had 4,499,608 
members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444. During 
this time 4,122,354 new members were brought into the fellowship. 
Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago. During 
this period 7,484,268 members were received, yet the net membership 
now is only 9,910,741. These figures indicate that we are losing 
almost as many as we are receiving into membership.   This problem 
is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the 
active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship. 
Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where population 
is expanding, show that numbers of churches have had little net 
increase, though many new members were received. Something is wrong when 
these things happen. The local "family of God" has failed its 
new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare. 

#BASIC NEEDS#

NEW MEMBERS <can> become participating, growing 
members. But this will not happen merely through the natural process 
of social life. It must be planned and carefully developed. The 
entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part 
in this dynamic process.   If the church has followed the plan 
of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership 
preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process of assimilation 
and growth will be well under way. Those who enter the <front 
door> of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will 
not so easily step through the <back door> because of lost interest.

However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment 
and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship. When 
they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction 
of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into 
effective Christians.   The Church expects certain things of 
those who become members. The new members justifiably expect some things 
from their church family:  - Welcome into the fellowship 
  - Sincere Christian love and understanding  - Inspiring 
and challenging worship experiences  - Social and recreational 
activities  - Opportunities for Christian service 
  - Opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible 
  - Creative prayer experiences  - Guidance in Christian 
social concerns

MEN need unity and they need God. Care must be taken neither 
to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas 
about him, but with these two qualifications, the statement stands. 
The statement also points to a classic paradox: The more men turn 
toward God, who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but 
also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established, 
the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one 
another. To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map 
and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political 
ones, with a resultant fragmentation of the human race. Massacres 
attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State 
of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such 
divisions can engender. The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly 
to 
mind: "Oh how we hate one another for the love of God"!

The source of this paradox is not difficult to identify. It lies 
in institutions. Institutions require structure, form, and definition, 
and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion. A completely 
amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms; to escape 
this fate, it must rule some things out. For every criterion which 
defines what something is, at the same time proclaims- implicitly if 
not openly- what that something is not. Some persons are so sensitive 
to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether; 
in the present context this amounts to the advice that while 
being religious may have a certain justification, we ought to dispense 
with churches. The suggestion is naive. Man is at once a gregarious 
animal and a form-creating being. Having once committed himself to 
an ideal which he considers worthwhile, he inevitably creates forms 
for its expression and institutions for its continuance. To propose that 
men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing 
that they be learned without having schools. Both eventualities 
are possible logically, but practically they are impossible. As much 
as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God, they instrumentally 
require the institutions that will direct their steps toward 
him.   Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men 
at odds with their fellows. Is there any way out of the predicament? 
The only way that I can see is through communication. Interfaith 
communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited 
upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our 
adversaries. Approached creatively, it is a high art. It is the art 
of relating the finite to the infinite, of doing our best to insure that 
the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not 
thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary. 
In a certain sense, interfaith communication parallels diplomatic 
communication among the nation-states.   What are the pertinent 
facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history? 
I shall touch on three areas: personal, national, and theological. 
#/1,#

By personal factors I mean those rooted in personality 
structure. Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological 
differences at all, but by the need of men to have persons they 
can blame, distrust, denounce, and even hate. Such needs may rise 
to pathological proportions. Modern psychology has shown that paralleling 
"the authoritarian personality" is "the bigoted personality" 
in which insecurity, inferiority, suspicion, and distrust combine 
to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured 
if it does not exist naturally. Fortunately the number of 
pathological bigots appears to be quite small, but it would be a mistake 
to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the 
rest of us. To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices 
attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us.   Interfaith 
conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most 
unfortunate of all, for they have no redeeming features whatsoever. 
It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must 
learn to recognize when it is they, rather than pretexts for them, 
that are causing the trouble, and do everything possible to nurture the 
healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies. 
#/2,#

While the personality factors that aggravate interfaith 
conflict may be perennial, nationalism is more variable. The 
specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-Asian version which 
has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century.

Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination, the 
Afro-Asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires. 
No less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence 
since World War /2,, and the number is growing by the year. As 
an obvious consequence, obstacles to genuine interfaith communication 
have grown more formidable in one important area: relations between 
Christians and non-Christians in these lands. Colonialism alone would 
have been able to make these difficulties serious, for Christianity 
is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that 
repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation 
of the other. Actually, however, this turns out to be only part of 
the picture. Nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign 
religions but the revival of native ones, some of which had been lying 
in slumber for centuries. The truth is that any revival of traditional 
and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity 
and <Volksgeist> which these young nations very much need. Insofar 
as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life 
which constitute ultimate, trans-political justifications for their existence, 
such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which 
these traditions and ways are <theirs> rather than someone else's.

All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural 
communication for which Christian missions stand. Africans and Asians 
tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have 
produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not 
of direct political propaganda. The people hardest hit by this suspicion 
are, of course, Christians on the mainland of China. But the 
problem extends elsewhere. For example, in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists 
argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion. 
In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian- preponderantly Christian- 
schools, to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and 
the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics. Again, India has imposed 
formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries, 
and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against 
Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru 
and his followers is gone.   The progressive closing of Afro-Asian 
ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation 
I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo. I was 
seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world 
radio program. He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable 
number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio 
networks, but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them. 
After returning to the United States and raising the money, he 
discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available. 
It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval; 
they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes. 
It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost 
vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures 
and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this 
heightening of anti-Christian sentiment. Ironically, these are the 
groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since 
World War /2,, while the more established denominations are barely 
maintaining pre-war staffs.   Although I have emphasized the 
barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between 
Christians and non-Christians in Asia, the fact is that this development 
has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-Asian religions 
themselves. The partition of India has hardly improved relations 
between Hindus and Muslims; neither has the establishment of the 
State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews. #/3,# 

I turn finally to several theological developments. _1._ <Theocracy 
reconsidered>. The modern world has been marked by progressive 
disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state, whatever 
its political form. The American Constitution was historic at 
this point in providing that "Congress shall make no law respecting 
an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". 
One of our foremost jurists, David Dudley Field, has gone so 
far as to call this provision "the greatest achievement ever made in 
the course of human history".   The trend throughout the world's 
religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical 
validity of this constitutional enactment. Pakistan was created in 
1947 expressly as a Muslim state, but when the army took over eleven 
years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed 
in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think 
their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political 
situation. "What is the point", Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis 
as asking, "in demanding an Islamic state and society if no 
one, not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves, can say clearly 
and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is"? 
The current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly 
secular. And while the nation was formerly named "The Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan", it is now simply "The Republic of Pakistan".

Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere. The new regime 
in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor. The 
religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige 
in recent months. During the years when Israel was passing from 
crisis to crisis- the Sinai campaign, the infusion of multitudes of 
penniless immigrants- it was felt that the purpose of national unity 
could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious 
parties. Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction 
of tensions, the secularists are less disposed to compromise. 
And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between 
the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign 
served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the 
practical autonomy of both church and state. The failure at that time 
of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added 
a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument. 
Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that 
governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible- 
in a word, too human- to warrant any claim of maintaining 
partnership with the divine. _2._ <Salvation reconsidered>. My 
father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded 
to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands 
and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese 
souls were going to hell each second because these students were not 
over there saving them. That mention of this should bring smiles to 
our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent 
to which attitudes have changed. I do not mean to imply that Christians 
have adopted the liberal assumption, so prevalent in Hinduism, 
that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit. Leslie 
Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council 
of Churches when he says, "We must claim absoluteness and finality 
for Christ and His finished work, but that very claim forbids 
us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it". 
Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable 
significance. The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of 
its priests, Father Feeney, for insisting that there is no salvation 
outside the visible church. In mentioning this under "salvation 
reconsidered" I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine 
has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the 
world community what that doctrine is. 
When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to "permit" 
the termination of the human race by human action, because 
there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify 
such a thing, they know exactly what they mean. Of course, in prudential 
calculation, in balancing the good directly intended and done against 
the evil unintended and indirectly done, no greater precision can 
be forthcoming than the subject allows. Yet it seems clear that there 
can be no good sufficiently great, or evil repelled sufficiently grave, 
to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action.

I mean, however, that the moral theologian knows what he means by "permit". 
He is not talking in the main about probabilities, risks 
and danger in general. He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously 
does an evil thing (and is known certainly and unavoidably 
to lead to this evil result) as it efficaciously does some good. He 
is talking about double <effects,> of which the specific action causes 
directly the one and indirectly the other, but <causes> both; 
of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended 
or not directly intended, but still both are <done,> while the 
evil effect is, with equal consciousness on the part of the agent, foreknown 
to be among the consequences. This is what, in a technical sense, 
to "only permit" an evil result means. It means to <do it> 
and to know one is doing it, but as only a secondary if certain effect 
of the good one primarily does and intends. Of course, grave guiltiness 
may be imputed to the military action of any nation, or to the action 
of any leader or leaders, which for any supposed good "permits", 
in <this> sense, the termination of the human race by human action. 
Certainly, in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives, 
"it is <never> possible that no world would be preferable to 
some worlds, and there are in truth <no> circumstances in which the 
destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative".

Naturally, where one or the other of the effects of an action 
is uncertain, this has to be taken into account. Especially is this 
true when, because the good effect is remote and speculative while 
the evil is certain and grave, the action is prohibited. Presumably, 
if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the 
evil result that may be forthcoming, not only must the good and the 
evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate, but also calculation 
of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty 
in the good or evil effect must be taken into account. There must 
not only be greater good than evil objectively in view, but also greater 
probability of actually doing more good than harm. If an evil which 
is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for 
by a problematic, speculative, future good, by the same token not every 
present, certain, and immediate good (or lesser evil) that may have 
to be done will be outweighed by a problematic, speculative, and future 
evil. Nevertheless, according to the traditional theory, a man begins 
in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate cosequences 
before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences. 
He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences 
of his action. Above all, he does not debate mere contingencies, 
and therefore, if these are possibly dreadful, find himself forced 
into inaction. He does what he can and may and must, without regarding 
himself as lord of the future or, on the other hand, as covered with 
guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not 
"permit" in the sense explained. By contrast, a good deal of nuclear 
pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities, and 
not with the moral nature of the action to be done; and by deriving 
legitimate decision backward from whatever may <conceivably> or possibly 
or probably result, whether by anyone's doing or by accident, 
it finds itself driven to inaction, to non-political action in politics 
and non-military action in military affairs, and to the not very surprising 
discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense 
of justice can possibly be based.   Mr& Philip Toynbee 
writes, for example, that "in terms of probability it is surely <as 
likely as not> that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near 
future <if the present situation continues>. If it continues indefinitely 
it is <nearly a statistical certainty> that a mistake will 
be made and that the devastation will begin". Against such a termination 
of human life on earth by human action, he then proposes as an 
alternative that we "negotiate at once with the Russians and get the 
best terms which are available", that we deliberately "negotiate 
from comparative weakness". He bravely attempts to face this alternative 
realistically, i&e&, by considering the worst possible outcome, 
namely, the total domination of the world by Russia within a few 
years. This would be by far the better choice, when "it is a question 
of <allowing> the human race to survive, possibly under the domination 
of a regime which most of us detest, or of <allowing> it to 
destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish". Nevertheless, the 
consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified: 
it is "a possible result, however improbable"; "the worst, and 
least probable" result; "if it didn't prevail <mankind> would 
still be given the opportunity of prevailing"; for "surely 
anything is better than a policy which allows for the <possibility> 
of nuclear war". If we have not thought and made a decision entirely 
in these terms, then we need to submit ourselves to the following 
"simple test": "Have we decided how we are to kill the other 
members of our household in the event of our being less injured than 
they are"? Thus, moral decision must be entirely deduced backward 
from the likely eventuality; it is no longer to be formulated in terms 
of the nature of present action itself, its intention, and proximate 
effect or the thing to be <done>.   Several of the replies 
to Mr& Toynbee, without conscious resort to the traditional terminology 
with regard to the permission of evil, succeed in restoring the 
actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be 
made, by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in 
danger of this evil. "It is worse for a nation to give in to evil 
**h than to run the risk of annihilation". "I am consciously prepared 
to run the continued risk of 'race suicide by accident' rather 
than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design. But 
I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need 
not increase, but may be deliberately reduced" [by precautions against 
accidents or by limiting war?] "Quoting Mr& Kennan's 
phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably 
to nuclear war, he [Toynbee] says that anything is better than a 
policy which allows for the <possibility> of nuclear war". "If 
asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility, 
most men will choose the latter". "If **h Philip Toynbee 
is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the <risk> 
of nuclear war, I think he is right. I do not accept that the choice 
is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war". Even 
Professor Arnold Toynbee, agreeing with his son, does so in these 
terms: "Compared to continuing to incur a constant <risk> of 
the destruction of the human race, all other evils are lesser evils **h. 
Let us therefore put first things first, and make sure of preserving 
the human race at whatever the temporary price may be".   Mr& 
Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that <if> he shared the 
anticipations of Orwell in <Nineteen Eighty-Four, if> he believed 
Communism was not only evil but "also <irredeemably> evil", then 
he might "think it right to do anything rather than to take the 
risk of a communist world. Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less 
frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the 
earth until doomsday". No political order or economic system is 
so clearly contrary to nature. But one does not have to affirm the existence 
of an evil order irredeemable in that sense, or a static order 
in which no changes will take place in time, to be able truthfully to 
affirm the following fact: there has never been <justitia> imprinted 
in social institutions and social relationships except in the context 
of some <pax-ordo> preserved by clothed or naked force. On their 
way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the <pax-ordo> 
of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility 
for its preservation. Not to repel injury and uphold and improve 
<pax-ordo> means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice 
that challenges it at the moment, but also to start down the steep 
slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand. Toynbee 
seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social 
embodiment. "I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of 
this country- by some deliberate act of refusal- than die uselessly 
by atomisation". Would such an act of refusal be useful? He does 
not mean, in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the 
proposition, that "if we took the risk of surrendering, a new generation 
in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order 
to reverse the consequences of that surrender". He wants to be 
"brutally frank and say that these rebellions <would> be hopeless- 
far, far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956". 
This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war, by 
creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited 
weapons. It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other 
than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it, or preconditioned 
more positive means for attaining it, in the past. "It is 
no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso 
that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance 
by occupied peoples. Hope for the future **h would lie in the 
natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop". 
This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted, 
to the very last; it is to stride along the steep slope downward. 
The only contrary action, in the future as in the past, runs the 
<risk> of war; and, now and in the future unlike in the past, any 
attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment 
of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear 
warfare and the danger that an effect of it will, by human action, render 
this planet less habitable by the human race. That is why it is 
so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision 
as to "permitted" effects, and not draw back in fright from 
any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities 
or probabilities unrelated, or not directly morally related, 
to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.

Finally, just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful 
analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end 
of human life on this earth, but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination, 
the same thing must be said in connection with the question 
of what we may perhaps already be doing, <by human action,> to accelerate 
this end. We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought 
about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle 
for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that 
in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence 
among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know 
not what future.

MUCH MORE than shelter, housing symbolizes social status, 
a sense of "belonging", acceptance within a given group or neighborhood, 
identification with particular cultural values and social institutions, 
feelings of pride and worth, aspirations and hopes basic to 
human well-being. For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination 
in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow 
upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans.

Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure 
to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders. 
This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying 
their professional ethics; it has sought new sympathy for the human 
aspirations of racial minority groups in this country. It is not surprising 
that, as spokesman for real estate interests, the National Association 
of Real Estate Boards (~NAREB) and its local associations 
have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure.

How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing 
restrictions based on race, religion or ethnic attachment? What 
does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest? What 
ought to be, what is his potential role as a force for constructive social 
change? What social, ethical and theological insights can the 
church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation?

Recently, a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public 
Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions. Several 
New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium 
of property lawyers, political scientists, economists, social psychologists, 
social ethicists and theologians. Here, in an atmosphere 
of forthrightness and mutual criticism, each sought to bring his particular 
insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing 
and the part each man present played in it.   For a number of years, 
Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business 
leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty 
and student body, attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their 
responsibility for public policy. This article presents our observations 
of that session, of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the 
faculty and students saw them.   Such conversation quickly reveals 
an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most 
realtors. Within the membership of this group, as has been found true 
of men in other professional or trade associations, the most ready 
portrayal of oneself to "the public" is that of a neutral agent simply 
serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between 
them. Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving 
the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner. But as 
conversation goes on, particularly among the realtors themselves, another 
image emerges, that of considerable power and influence in the community. 
Obviously, much more than customer expectation is determining 
the realtor's role. Judgments are continually rendered regarding 
the potential buyers' income, educational level and above all, racial 
extraction; and whether these would qualify them for "congenial", 
"happy" relations to other people in certain community areas. 

#A NARROW PROFESSIONALISM#

How explicit such factors have been 
historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases 
or in a review of ~NAREB's Code of Ethics Article 34 in 
the Code, adopted in 1924, states that "a Realtor should never be 
instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property 
or occupancy, members of any race or nationality, or any individuals 
whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that 
neighborhood". Though the reference to race was stricken by the association 
in 1950, being an agent of such "detrimental" influences 
still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to 
avoid.   The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently 
expressed in economic terms; all feared the supposed stigma they believed 
would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white, 
particularly Negro, peoples into all-white, restricted areas. 
They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real 
estate "professionals" but agitators for some kind of "cause" 
or "reform", and this was no longer to be a "pro".   Obviously 
what we are confronted with here is the identification of "professional" 
with narrow skills and specialization, the effective servicing 
of a client, rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper 
meaning and associations of one's work. These men- for the most 
part educated in our "best" New England colleges, well established 
financially and socially in the community- under kindly but insistent 
probing, reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data 
for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the 
people they claim to serve, or about the public responses that actually 
follow their occasional breach of a "client-service relationship".

This narrow "professionalism" does not even fit the present 
realities of their situation, as the pressure of minorities and the 
power and respectability of the realtors increase. As our discussion 
continued, the inadequacy of the "client relationship" as an interpretation 
of their "way of operating" became evident. Realtors 
live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work, as 
members of social and professional organizations, as citizens and civic 
leaders, as church laymen, as university alumni, as newspaper readers, 
etc&. 
From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that 
shapes his moral understanding.   It seems to us that choices exercised 
by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas: 
(1) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social 
issue; (2) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political 
processes; and, most pervasively, (3) their interpretation of 
who is a "real pro", of what it means to be a professional man in 
a technical, fragmented society.   (1) Most of the realtors minimized 
their own understanding of and role in the racial issue, pleading 
that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society. 
There is some reality to this; the Commission on Race and Housing 
concluded that "there is no reason to believe that real estate 
men are either more or less racially prejudiced, on the whole, than any 
other segment of the American population". But such a reaction obscures 
the powerful efforts made in the past by both ~NAREB and 
its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices. 
Also, it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment 
continually employed.   Like business and university groups generally, 
these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and 
psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions 
they make. Realtors, both generally and in this group, have invariably 
equated residential integration with a decline in property values, 
a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension.   Recent 
studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others, however, 
point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion. 
There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated 
residentially without great loss of property values, the white population 
having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation 
of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing, privacy, etc&. 
Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial 
group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property 
values before the group comes in. Often they are able to get in 
only because the area is declining economically.   Significantly, 
no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of 
the six volumes (published by the University of California Press) 
that present the commission's findings. No one anticipates any radical 
shift in this situation, but questions concerning reading habits, 
the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must 
surely be raised. The role of both church and university as sources 
of information and settings within which the implications of such information 
may be explored needs consideration.   Relevant "facts", 
however, 
extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance 
of "harmonious" neighborhoods. Discussion of minority housing necessarily 
involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic 
conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity, 
the function and limitations of government in the securing of such 
equality, and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents 
of racial agitation and strife. #"AGAINST THE GRAIN OF CREATION"# 
(2) Realtors realize, of course, that they are involved in an 
increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities 
for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities 
for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination 
in housing. On the positive side, recent Federal action has largely 
undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position; 
anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted 
by thirteen states and, while specific provisions have varied, the 
tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.   Realtors in attendance 
at the colloquium expressed interest, for example, in Connecticut's 
new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would 
like "to have to obey", but in support of which none had been willing 
to go on public record. As far as they were aware, the Connecticut 
Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed 
the bill's passage or lobbied in its support. (This has not been the 
case everywhere. In 1957, the Real Estate Boards of New York City 
actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination 
law. Official reasoning: the bill was a "wanton invasion 
of basic property rights".)   There are sins of omission as 
well as commission; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations, 
either negative or positive, plays a large part in the public 
acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively 
enforced. Judicial opinion since the Supreme Court decision 
on <Shelley v& Kraemer> (1948) has rendered racial restrictive 
covenants unenforcible. Such a decision should have placed a powerful 
weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry, but there is little 
evidence that realtors, or at least their associations, have repudiated 
the principle in such clauses.   In the states that have passed 
laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing, 
support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage 
through additional legislation could help remove the label of "social 
reformism" that most realtors individually seem determined to 
avoid. But as yet, no real estate board has been willing officially 
to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority 
buyers into all-white neighborhoods.   One of the roles of 
the social scientist, ethicist or theologian in our discussions with 
the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities 
offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise 
of broad social responsibilities in their work. But responsiveness to 
these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human 
good and not simply as a professional, white, American good. Such 
judgments are meaningful only 
in so far as persons are members of a world, 
let us say a community, that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers, but is 
also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.   That community 
of all creation is, then, the ultimate object of our loyalty and 
the concrete norm of all moral judgment. Racial discrimination is wrong, 
then, not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying 
to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the 
grain of creation and against the will of the Creator. Thus, moral issues 
concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take 
on theological dimensions. 

#A FRAGMENTED SOCIETY#

(3) Over the years, 
individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable 
unity in the methods and practices employed. Most realtors and 
real estate brokers talk of themselves as "professional people" 
with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions. 
But what significance attaches to "professional", beyond the narrow 
sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already 
noted? Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than 
any other.   As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional 
was, before the modern period of technical specialization, one who 
"professed" to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use 
of his particular skills.

If we look about the world today, we can see clearly that there 
are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization: 
<science> and <religion>. Science is placing in our 
hands the ultimate power of the universe, the power of the atom. Religion, 
or the lack of it, will decide whether we use this power to build 
a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind, or whether 
we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed. How can we 
have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge?   We 
may feel pessimistic at the outlook. And yet there is a note of 
hope, 
because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is 
also giving us atomic vision. We are looking inside the atom and seeing 
there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material, 
a universe that in a word is not matter but music. And it is 
in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration 
of our faith. 

#ATOMIC ENERGY#

To see this vision in perspective, 
we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new 
power from the atom. You know that I could hold right here in my 
hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb 
that dropped on Hiroshima. It was only about the size of a baseball; 
but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 
20,000 tons of ~TNT. That is enough ~TNT to fill the tower 
of the Empire State Building; and with the availability of bombs 
of that size, war became a new problem.   Now we might have restricted 
the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium 
because it is found in only a few places in the world. But we had hardly 
started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we 
were faced with the hydrogen bomb. Hydrogen is just as plentiful as 
uranium is scarce. We know that we have hydrogen in water; water is 
**f and the ~H stands for hydrogen; there is also hydrogen in wood 
and hydrogen in our bodies. I have calculated that if I could snap 
my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen 
in my body, I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of 
the kind that fell on Hiroshima. I won't try the experiment, but 
I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let 
ourselves go, there would be quite an explosion. And then think how 
little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware 
Bay or in the ocean beyond. Salt water is still **f, the same hydrogen 
is there. And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the 
destructive power we hold in our hands today.   Of course, there 
is also an optimistic side to the picture. For if I knew the secret 
of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity, 
I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power 
in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories 
in the entire United States for some days. And think, if we all knew 
this secret and we could pool our power, what a wonderful public utility 
company we would make. With just the hydrogen of our bodies, we 
could run the world for years. Then think of Delaware Bay and the 
ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years 
to come. It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world, 
provide adequate housing, food, education, abundant living for everyone 
everywhere. 

#AN OCTILLION ATOMS#

Now let us see where this power 
comes from. To grasp our new view of the atom, we have to appreciate 
first of all how small the atom is. I have been trying to make this 
clear to my own class in chemistry. One night there were some dried 
peas lying on our kitchen table, and these peas looked to me like a little 
group of atoms; and I asked myself a question: Suppose I 
had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body, how large an 
area would they cover?   I calculated first that there are 
about an octillion atoms in the average human body; that is a figure 
one with 27 ciphers, quite a large number. Then I calculated that a 
million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator; a billion 
peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic; a trillion peas 
would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people; 
and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia.

I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at 
this rate, so I decided to take another measure- the whole state of 
Pennsylvania. Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania, 
but instead of snowing snow, it snows peas; so we get the whole state 
covered with peas, about four feet deep. You can imagine what it would 
look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against 
the houses and covering the cars; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would 
contain about a quintillion peas.   But we still have a long 
way to go. Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas 
of the entire globe- North America, South America, Europe, Asia, 
and Africa, all covered with peas four feet deep; then we have 
sextillion peas. Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole 
earth with peas, then we go out among the neighboring stars, collect 
250 planets each the size of the earth, and also cover each of these 
with peas four feet deep; and then we have septillion. Finally we 
go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way; we get 250,000 planets; 
we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last 
we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body. 
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are. 

#A 
SPECK- AND SPACE#

Now although an atom is small, we can still in 
imagination have a look at it. Let us focus on an atom of calcium from 
the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow 
a magic <Alice in Wonderland> growing pill. I start growing rapidly 
and this calcium atom grows along with me. I shoot up through the 
roof, into the sky, past the clouds, through the stratosphere, out beyond 
the moon, out among the planets, until I am over a hundred and 
fifty million miles long. Then this atom of calcium will swell to something 
like a great balloon a hundred yards across, a balloon big enough 
to put a football field inside. And if you should step inside of such 
a magnified atom, according to the physics of forty years ago, you 
would see circulating over your head, down at the sides, and under your 
feet, some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs. These 
balls are moving in great circles and ellipses, and are of course, the 
electrons, the particles of negative electricity which by their action 
create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring 
atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone.

Since these electrons are moving like planets, you may wonder whether 
there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom. So you look down 
there and you see a tiny, whirling point about the size of the head 
of a pin. This is the atomic sun, the atomic nucleus. Even if the 
atom were big enough to hold a football field, this nucleus is still 
only about the size of a pinhead. It is this atomic nucleus that contains 
the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged 
electrons in their orbits; it also contains nearly all the mass, 
and the atomic energy.   You may ask what else there is, and the 
answer is nothing- nothing but empty space. And since you are made 
of atoms, you are nothing much but empty space, too. If I could put 
your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down, squeeze 
these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge, 
you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole 
was gone, you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you 
could see on this piece of paper. Someone has remarked that this is 
certainly the ultimate in reducing. At any rate, it shows us how immaterial 
we are. 

#MUSIC OF THE SPHERES#

Now this 1920 view of the 
atom was on the whole a discouraging picture. For we believed that the 
electrons 
obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics; and therefore 
the atom was really just a little machine; and in mechanics the 
whole is no more than the sum of the parts. So if you are made of 
atoms, you are just a big machine; and since the universe is also made 
of atoms, it is just a supermachine. And this would mean that we 
live in a mechanistic universe, governed by the laws of cause and effect, 
bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely 
predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit 
or human freedom. And this is why so many scientists a half a century 
ago were agnostics or atheists.   Then came the scientific revolution 
in the late 1920's. A suggestion from Louis de Broglie, a 
physicist in France, showed us that these electrons are not point particles 
but waves. And to see the meaning of this new picture, imagine 
that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom 
and have a look at it in the way we view it today. Now as you step 
inside, instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets, you 
see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface 
of a pond when you drop a stone into it. These ripples spread 
out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral. 
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from 
the neighboring atoms, you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear 
music. It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra 
playing a symphony. Harmony, melody, counterpoint symphonic structure 
are there; and as this music ebbs and flows, there is an antiphonal 
chorus from all the atoms outside, in fact from the atoms of 
the entire universe. And so today when we examine the structure of our 
knowledge of the atom and of the universe, we are forced to conclude 
that the best word to describe our universe is <music>.

The Island of Nantucket, part of the State of Massachusetts, 
lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State. Some of 
the Island is sand and is not suitable for living. The Island folk 
have their living almost entirely from summer visitors; the rest is 
obtained from harbor scallops. During about three and a half months 
of the year, in the summer, there are three boats that run from the mainland 
to the Island carrying passengers, food, and cars; but the 
rest of the year only one boat is needed, which ties up at the mainland 
nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime. This 
is a fine trip, too, on a good day. With Martha's Vineyard on one 
side and the open sea on the other, it makes an excellent trip of about 
three hours.

TO WHAT extent and in what ways did Christianity affect 
the United States of America in the nineteenth century? How far 
and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging 
in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age? To what 
extent did it mould the morals and the social, economic, and political 
life and institutions of the country?   A complete picture is 
impossible- partly because of the limitations of space, partly because 
for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian 
faith data are unobtainable. Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty 
of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors.

Although a complete picture cannot be given, we can indicate 
some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at 
least one creative factor. At times we can say that it was the major 
factor.   What in some ways was the most important aspect was the 
impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation. As 
we have seen, a growing proportion, although in 1914 still a minority, 
were members of churches. Presumably those who did not have a formal 
church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater 
or less extent. Many of them had once been members of a church 
or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or 
another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse. The form of Christianity 
to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of 
the older stock, for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century 
immigration; for still others, mostly of the nineteenth-century 
immigration, it was Roman Catholicism, and for a small minority it was 
Eastern Orthodoxy. Upon all of them played the intellectual, social, 
political, and economic attitudes, institutions, and customs of the 
nation. Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through 
them had had a share in making the individual what he was. Yet 
to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual 
showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible. At 
best only an approximation could be arrived at. To generalize for the 
entire nation would be absurd. For instance, we cannot know whether 
even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards 
of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members 
in the population rose. The temptation is to say that, as the percentage 
of church members mounted, the degree of discipline exercised 
by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general 
level. Yet this cannot be proved. We know that in the early part 
of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action 
against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority 
subscribed. Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance 
of charges against their members of drunkenness, fighting, malicious 
gossip, lying, cheating, sexual irregularities, gambling, horse racing, 
and failure to pay just debts. If guilty, the offender might be excluded 
from membership. As church membership burgeoned, such measures 
faded into desuetude. But whether this was accompanied by a general 
lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know.   What 
we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point 
out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects 
of the life of the nation. We have already hinted at the fashion in 
which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life. 
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals 
of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain 
those ideals through reform movements, through programmes for bringing 
the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards, 
and through leaders in the government.   Throughout the 
nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American 
society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock. 
By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning 
to make itself felt, mainly through such institutions as hospitals 
but also through its attitude towards organized labour. In the twentieth 
century its influence grew, as did that of the Protestantism of 
the nineteenth-century immigration. 

#THE AMERICAN DREAM#

The ideals 
of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the 
older stock. Thus "America", the most widely sung of the patriotic 
songs, was written by a New England Baptist clergyman, Samuel Francis 
Smith (1808-1895), while a student in Andover Theological 
Seminary. With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it 
breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals. 
The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by 
the Christian faith. Here was what was called the American dream, namely, 
the effort to build a structure which would be something new in 
history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it. Later 
in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine 
Lee Bates (1859-1929), daughter and granddaughter of New England 
Congregational ministers, in her widely sung hymn, written in 
1893, "America the Beautiful", with the words "O beautiful 
for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom 
beat across the wilderness. America, America, God mend 
thy every flaw, confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law 
**h. O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine 
alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears. America, America, 
God shed His grace on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood from 
sea to shining sea".   The American dream was compounded of 
many strains. Some were clearly of Christian origin, among them the 
Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian 
liberty, Christian equality, and Christian fraternity the passion of 
the land. Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection 
as the fountain-head of the American hope. Here, too, must 
be placed Unitarianism and, less obviously from Christian inspiration, 
Emerson, Transcendentalism, and the idealism of Walt Whitman. We 
must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of 
myth- among them Melville, Hawthorne, and Henry James the elder, 
all of them out of a Christian background. 

#REFORM MOVEMENTS#

With 
such a dream arising, at least in part, from the Protestant heritage 
of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation, 
it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete 
expression. A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or 
remove social ills.   Significantly, the initiation and leadership 
of a major proportion of the reform movements, especially those in 
the first half of the nineteenth century, came from men and women of 
New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian 
Congregationalism. Several of the movements were given a marked 
impetus by revivalism. Quakers, some from New England, had a larger 
share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted. 
We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England 
ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
Day Saints, the Seventh Day Adventists, Christian Science, the 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American 
Home Missionary Society, the American Bible Society, and New 
England theology. The atmosphere was one of optimism, of confidence 
in human progress, and of a determination to rid the world of its ills. 
The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence, although holding 
to original sin and the doctrine of election, inspired its adherents 
to heroic endeavours for others, looked for the early coming of the 
Millennium, and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability 
cherished by the Unitarians, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists.

We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind 
which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles 
and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe- among them prison 
reform, anti-slavery measures, legislation for the alleviation of conditions 
of labour, the Inner Mission, and the Red Cross.   We 
cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation 
of collective ills. A few of the more prominent must serve 
as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose. 
Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the 
century. Others were ephemeral. Some disappeared with the attainment 
of their purpose. Still others sprang up late in the century to meet 
conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age. 

#THE 
ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT#

The movement to end Negro slavery began 
before 1815 and mounted after that year until, as a result of the Civil 
War, emancipation was achieved.   Long before 1815 the Christian 
conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act 
accordingly. For example, in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting 
of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves 
and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not 
comply. In the latter year Samuel Hopkins, from whom the Hopkinsian 
strain of New England theology took its name, asked the Continental 
Congress to abolish slavery. As we have seen, Methodism early took 
a stand against slavery. Beginning at least as far back as 1789 various 
Baptist bodies condemned slavery.   After 1815 anti-slavery 
sentiment mounted, chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant 
background of the older stock. The nineteenth-century immigration, 
whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, was not so much concerned, 
for very few if any among them held slaves: they were mostly in the 
Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out, 
or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.   The anti-slavery movement 
took many forms. Benjamin Lundy (1789-1839), a Quaker, was 
a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies. It was 
he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879) 
to the subject. Garrison, Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage, 
was by temperament and conviction a reformer. Chiefly remembered 
because of his incessant advocacy of "immediate and unconditional 
abolition", he also espoused a great variety of other causes- among 
them women's rights, prohibition, and justice to the Indians. Incurably 
optimistic, dogmatic, and utterly fearless, in his youth a devout 
Baptist, in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John 
Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892) he eventually attacked the orthodox 
churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery 
issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox 
and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible.   A marked 
impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals. 
Finney himself, while opposed to slavery, placed his chief emphasis 
on evangelism, but from his converts issued much of the leadership of 
the anti-slavery campaign. Theodore Dwight Weld (1803-1895) was 
especially active. Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational 
ministers. As a youth he became one of Finney's band 
of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men. A strong temperance 
advocate, through the influence of a favorite teacher, Charles 
Stewart, another Finney convert, he devoted himself to the anti-slavery 
cause. A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological 
Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery 
position. The majority then went to the infant Oberlin. They and 
others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win 
adherents to the cause. Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions 
of such men as Joshua R& Giddings and Edwin M& Stanton, 
enlisted John Quincy Adams, and helped provide ideas which underlay 
Harriet Beecher Stowe's <Uncle Tom's Cabin>. He shunned 
publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.   Wendell Phillips 
(1811-1884), from a prominent Massachusetts family, in his teens 
was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher. Although he 
later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently 
outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout Christian. 
He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition, 
but he also stood for equal rights for women, for opportunity for the 
freedmen, and for prohibition.   The anti-slavery movement and 
other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership 
and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan (1786-1865) and his younger 
brother, Lewis Tappan (1788-1873).

Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power 
were transmuted at death into awesome spirits; they were almost immediately 
worshipped for these newer, even more terrible abilities. Their 
direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes, but also 
the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of 
the universe. Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly 
achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power.   Thus, 
the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less 
puissant ancestors. But this eminence was not without its weighty 
responsibilities. 
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe 
of living beings and dead spirits, the emperor had to use it for 
the benefit of the living. The royal ritual generated power into the 
other world: it also provided the living with a way to control the 
spirits, and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs 
of the world. Proper ritual observance at any level of society was 
capable of generating power for use in the spirit world; but naturally, 
the royal ritual, which provided unusual control over already supremely 
powerful divine spirits, was held responsible for regulating the 
universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.   This is the 
familiar system of "cosmic government". The Chinese emperor, by 
proper observance of ritual, manifested divine powers. He regulated 
the dualities of light and darkness, <Yang> and <Yin>, which are 
locked in eternal struggle. By swaying the balance between them, he 
effected the alternation of the seasons. His power was so great that 
he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given 
ear or been deaf to petitions.   In this system, no man is exempt 
from obligations. Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's 
family, outrages to community propriety, any departure from rigid 
standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead. And to 
offend the dead meant to incur their wrath, and thus provoke the unleashing 
of countrywide disasters. The family home was, in fact, a temple; 
and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in 
nature. The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and 
in every fear.   The common belief was that there existed one 
moral order, which included everything. The dead controlled the material 
prosperity of the living, and the living adhered to strict codes of 
conduct in order not to weaken that control. Men believed they could 
control nature by obeying a moral code. If the moral code were flouted, 
the proper balance of the universe would be upset, and the disastrous 
result could be floods, plague, or famine.   Modern Westerners 
have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material, 
largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the 
connection. Living in urban conditions, away from the deadweight of 
village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view, 
the individual may find it possible, say, to commit adultery not only 
without personal misgivings, but also without suffering any adverse 
effects in his worldly fortunes. Basing action on the empirical determination 
of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no 
powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart- plus the added liberation 
from the constraint of silent burial urns.   In China, 
the magical system par excellence was Taoism. The Taoists were Quietist 
mystics, who saw an unchanging unity- the Tao- underlying 
all phenomena. It was this timeless unity that was all-important, and 
not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality. The Taoists 
believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation; 
in other words, they were actually an organization of magicians.

Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical 
concepts. After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced 
into China, it underwent extensive changes. During its flowering in 
the sixth to the eighth centuries, Mahayana offered a supernatural package 
to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested 
philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader. Mahayana 
had gods, and magic, a pantheon, heavens and hells, and gorgeously 
appareled priests, monks, and nuns, all of whom wielded power over 
souls in the other world. The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed 
superhuman powers and magic. The Mahayana that developed in the 
north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic, that made the world 
into a huge magical garden. In its monastic form, Mahayana was merely 
an organization of magic-practicing monks (<bonzes>), who catered 
to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.   Nonmagical Confucianism 
was a secular, rational philosophy, but even with this different 
orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government. 
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power. 
If a man lived a classical life, he need not fear the spirits- for 
only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him. But let us not be 
mistaken about Confucian "virtue"; this was not virtue as we 
understand the word today, and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief 
in magic manipulation. To the Confucian, "virtue" simply meant 
mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual 
and three thousand minor ones. Propriety was synonymous with ritual 
observance, the mark of a true gentleman. To live correctly in an 
interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive 
for man's fate.   This, in brief, was the historical background 
out of which Zen emerged. Promoters of Zen to the West record 
its ancestry, and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of 
Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism. But the "marvelous person" 
that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality 
than Indian speculation- he possesses magical powers, and can 
use them to order nature and to redeem souls. Proponents of Zen to 
the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism 
in Zen, probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist 
ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic. But in the Chinese 
mind, there was little difference between the two- the <bonzes> 
were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be.   Actually, 
Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism. 
The Ch'an (Zen) sect may have derived its metaphysic from 
Mahayana, but its psychology was pure early Taoist. This is well 
evidenced 
by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen: the idea of 
the inward turning of thought, the enjoinder to put aside desires and 
perturbations so that a return to purity, peace, and stillness- a 
union with the Infinite, with the Tao- could be effected. In fact, 
the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so 
uniquely characteristic of the "direct thinking" Zennist was a feature 
of Taoism. So, too, was the insistence on the relativity of the 
external world, and the ideas that language and things perceived by 
consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by 
pure, indwelling spirit: the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating 
consciousness.   Zen maintains that cognitive things 
are only the surface of experience. One of its features attractive 
to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred 
texts. One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures 
for use in an outhouse. But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom 
of action for which the Westerner mistakes it. It is simply that 
in Taoist tradition- as in all good mysticisms- books, words, 
or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness 
are considered only the surface of experience. The truth- the 
Eternal Truth- is not transmittable by words. Reality is considered 
not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge, but 
a positive handicap. The technique of reality confusion- the use of 
paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality- originated 
with fourth and third century B&C& Chinese Quietism: the 
<koan> is not basically a new device.   It is important for an 
understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of 
the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man. In the supernatural 
atmosphere of cosmic government, only the ruling elite was ever 
concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature: popular religion 
aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers. And this is only 
natural- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest 
"wonder drug". Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed 
at a mystic pantheist union with the divine, personal salvation being 
achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence. But 
this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers. 
The anchorite strove, in fact, to magically influence the world 
of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power. 
Thus, the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was 
distilled down to a bare self-seeking, and for this reason, the mystic 
in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation. As the Zen 
literature reveals, as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in 
seclusion, he was called out into the world to exercise his powers. 
The early anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed 
ability to perform miracles.   Exponents of Zen often insist 
that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism 
of China, and proposed instead a more mature, less credulous view of 
the universe. In support of this, stories from the early literature are 
cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power. But 
actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters 
were in fact supposed to possess, as well as the extreme degree of 
popular credulity: "Hwang Pah (O baku), one day going up Mount 
Tien Tai **h which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats 
with supernatural powers, met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light. 
They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while 
until they came to a river roaring with torrent. There being no bridge, 
the master had to stop at the shore; but his companion crossed 
the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow 
him. Thereupon Hwang Pah said: "If I knew thou art an Arhat, 
I would have doubled you up before thou got over there"! The monk 
then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah, and praised 
him as a true Mahayanist. (1)"   A second tale shows still 
more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess: 
"On one occasion Yang Shan (Kyo-zan) saw a stranger monk flying 
through the air. When that monk came down and approached him with a 
respectful salutation, he asked: "Where art thou from"? "Early 
this morning", replied the other, "I set out from India". 
"Why", said the teacher, "art thou so late"? "I stopped", 
responded the man, "several times to look at beautiful sceneries". 
"Thou mayst have supernatural powers", exclaimed Yang Shan, 
"yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me". Then 
the monk praised Yang Shan saying: "I have come over to China 
in order to worship Manjucri, and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya", 
and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India, 
went back through the air. (2)"   In the popular Chinese 
mind, Ch'an (Zen) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that 
dominated.   A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical 
carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes. To the 
Zen monk the universe is still populated with "spiritual beings" 
who have to be appeased. Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists 
in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings". Modern Zen presentation 
to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian, highly pragmatic 
nature of the Zen belief- scriptures are burned to make fire, 
action is based on direct self-confidence, and so on. This picture 
of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such 
Zendo formulas as: "O you, demons and other spiritual beings, 
I now offer this to you, and may this food fill up the ten quarters 
of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith. 
(3)"

Pope Leo /13,, on the 13th day of December 1898, granted 
the following indulgences: "An indulgence of three hundred days is 
granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a 
quarter of an hour. A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions 
is granted once a month for the daily reading". Pope Pius the Sixth, 
at Rome, in april, 1778, wrote the following: "The faithful 
should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures: For these 
are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone, 
to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate 
errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times". The 
American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore 
urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible. "We hope", 
they said, "that no family can be found amongst us without a 
correct version of the Holy Scriptures". They recommended, also, 
that "at a fixed hour, let the entire family be assembled for night 
prayers, followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures".

Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred 
Scriptures be read, the following taken from the Holy Bible (New 
Catholic Edition) will prove a means of grace and a source of great 
spiritual blessing. 

#THE NEED OF THE NEW BIRTH#

Do not wonder that 
I said to thee, "You must be born again". St& John 3:7. 

_THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE GOD IS HOLY._ But as the One 
who called you is holy, be you also holy in all your behavior; for 
it is written, You shall be holy, because I am holy. /1, St& Peter 
1:15, 16.   Holiness without which no man will see God. 
Hebrews 12:14. _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE ALL HAVE SINNED._ 
As it is written, There is not one just man; there is none 
who understands; there is none who seeks after God. All have gone 
astray together; **h All have sinned and have need of the glory of 
God. Romans 3:10-12, 23. _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE 
NATURAL MAN IS SPIRITUALLY DEAD AND BLIND._ Therefore as through 
one man sin entered into the world and through sin death, and thus death 
has passed unto all men because all have sinned. Romans 5:12.

You also, when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins. 
Ephesians 2:1.   And if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled 
only to those who are perishing. In their case, the god of this 
world [Satan] has blinded their unbelieving minds, that they should 
not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image 
of God. /2, Corinthians 4:3, 4.   For his workmanship 
we are, created in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:10. _THE NEW BIRTH 
IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD_ For you have been reborn, 
not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible, through the word of 
God. /1, St& Peter 1:23.   Of his own will he has begotten 
us by the word of truth. St& James 1:18.   Amen, amen, 
I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water [symbol of the 
Word of God, see Ephesians 5:26] and the Spirit, he cannot enter 
into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; 
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. St& John 3:5, 
6. 

#EVIDENCES OF THE NEW BIRTH#


_IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE HAVE 
FAITH IN CHRIST AS THE ONLY SAVIOUR._ Everyone who believes that 
Jesus is the Christ is born of God. /1, St& John 5:1.

As many as received him **h were born **h of God. St& John 1:12, 
13. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE DO NOT PRACTICE SIN AS A HABIT._ 
Whoever is born of God does not commit sin [That is, he does not 
practice sin. Cf& /1, St& John 2:1]. /1, St& John 3:9.

We know that no one who is born of God commits sin. /1, 
St& John 5:18. [The new nature, received at the time of regeneration, 
is divine and holy, and as the believer lives under the power 
of this new nature he does not practice sin.] _IF WE ARE BORN OF 
GOD WE PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS._ If you know that he [God] is just 
[righteous], know that everyone also who does what is just [righteous] 
has been born of him. /1, St& John 2:29. _IF WE ARE 
BORN OF GOD WE LOVE GOD._ Everyone who loves is born of God, and 
knows God. /1, St& John 4:7. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE 
THE BRETHREN._ We know that we have passed from death to life, because 
we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. /1, 
St& John 3:14. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE OVERCOME THE WORLD._ 
All that is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory 
that overcomes the world, our faith. /1, St& John 5:4. 

_IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE GROW IN [NOT INTO, BUT IN] GRACE._ But 
grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
/2, St& Peter 3:18. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PERSEVERE UNTO 
THE END._ I am convinced of this, that he who has begun a good work 
in you will bring it to perfection until the day of Christ Jesus. 
Philippians 1:6.   Now to him who is able to preserve you without 
sin and to set you before the presence of his glory, without blemish, 
in gladness, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ 
our Lord, belong glory and majesty, dominion and authority, before 
all time, and now, and forever. St& Jude 24. _THE NEW BIRTH IS 
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM REQUIRES A SPIRITUAL NATURE._ 
Jesus answered and said to him [Nicodemus] "Amen, amen, I say 
to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God". 
**h "Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again 
of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That 
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of 
the Spirit is spirit. Do not wonder that I said to thee, 'You must 
be born again'". St& John 3:3, 5-7. 

#THE NATURE OF THE 
NEW BIRTH#


_THE NEW BIRTH IS A NEW CREATION._ For in Christ Jesus 
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of 
any account. Galatians 6:15.   If then any man is in Christ, 
he is a new creature [literally, "He is a new creation"], the 
former things have passed away; behold, they are made new! /2, Corinthians 
5:17.   For by grace you have been saved through faith; 
and that not from yourselves, for it is the gift of God; not 
as the outcome of works, lest anyone may boast. For his workmanship 
we are, created in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:8-10. _THE NEW BIRTH 
IS THE IMPLANTATION OF A NEW LIFE._ I came that they may have life. 
St& John 10:10.   He who has the Son has the life. He 
who has not the Son has not the life. /1, St& John 5:12.

He who believes in the Son [Jesus Christ, the Son of God], 
has everlasting life. St& John 3:36. _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE 
IMPARTATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE._ Through which he has granted us 
the very great and precious promises, so that through them you may become 
partaker of the divine nature. /2, St& Peter 1:4. _THE NEW 
BIRTH IS CHRIST LIVING IN YOU BY FAITH._ Christ in you, your hope 
of glory. Colossians 1:27.   It is now no longer I that live, 
but Christ lives in me. And the life that I now live in the flesh, 
I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself 
up for me. Galatians 2:20.   To have Christ dwelling through 
faith in your hearts. Ephesians 3:17. _THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS 
AND MYSTERIOUS._ The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest 
its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes. 
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit. St& John 3:8. _THE 
NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS._ Amen, amen, I say to 
you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has life everlasting, 
and does not come to judgment, but has passed from death to 
life. St& John 5:24. 

#THE MEANS OF THE NEW BIRTH#


_THE NEW 
BIRTH IS A WORK OF GOD._ But to as many as received him he gave the 
power of becoming sons of God; to those who believe in his name: 
Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the 
will of man, but of God. St& John 1:12, 13. 

#A FINAL WORD# 

You may be very religious, a good church member, an upright, honest 
and sincere person; you may be baptized, confirmed, reverent and worshipful; 
you may attend mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously 
keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may have 
the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost 
and headed for hell and eternal punishment. You cannot be saved; 
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again. Our blessed Lord 
Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of God, who could not lie, said, 
"Amen, 
amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see 
the kingdom of God" (St& John 3:3). "You must be born again" 
(St& John 3:7).   Being convinced that salvation is 
alone by accepting Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy 
Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort to be saved 
by any form of good works, and just now receive Jesus as my personal 
Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him.

YOU MAY DO AS YOU 
PLEASE with God now. It is permitted. God placed Himself in men's 
hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God 
and perfect Man in one Being. He was then in man's hands. They 
cursed Him. It was permitted. Men spit on Him. God allowed it. 
They called Him a devil. God withheld His wrath. Finally men arrested 
Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged Him, nailed Him on a cross 
and hung Him between earth and heaven; and God allowed it.

You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present. You can 
ignore Him. You can ignore His Book, the Bible, and His church. 
You 
can laugh at His blood-bought salvation, curse His followers, and 
laugh at hell. It is permitted. The eternal Christ may knock at your 
soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven. 
You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him a devil, curse Him. It 
is permitted. You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses 
if you so choose. He is in your hands- <now>.   On the 
other hand, you may seek His favor, humble yourself before Him and beg 
His mercy, implore His forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon 
your whole life to Him. He has said, "Behold, I stand at the door, 
and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will 
come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 
3:20). The choice is up to you. The latch is on your side of the 
door. The choice is yours: the revellings and banquetings of this 
world or quiet communion with God; the ever burning lusts of the flesh 
or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline. The choice is 
yours: God is in your hands, <now>.   God has already set 
the day when <you will be in His hands>. What He does with you <then> 
depends on what you do with Him <now>. <Then> it will be 
a "fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" if you 
have abused Him in your hands. 
I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts; this issue that you are 
reading marks my 15th anniversary.   When I came into being, 15 
years ago, I had one primary purpose: to help men and women everywhere 
to know God better, and through knowing Him better to become happier 
and more effective people. That purpose has never changed.

When you read me, you are holding in your hands the product of many 
minds and hearts. Some of the people who speak through my pages are 
famous; others unknown. Some work with their hands. Some have walked 
through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope. Some 
are so filled with gratitude, for the gift of life and the love of God, 
that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands 
whom they have never known, and will never see.   Fifteen 
years ago, there were no Guideposts at all. This month a million 
Guideposts will circulate all over the world. Experts in the publishing 
field consider this astounding. They do not understand how a small 
magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved 
such a following.   To me, the explanation is very simple. I 
am not doing anything, of myself. I am merely a channel for **h <something>.

What is this something? I cannot define it fully. 
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness, even 
when they turn away from it. It is the power that holds the stars in 
their orbits, but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass. It is the 
whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is. It 
is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace.

All things are possible to God, but He chooses- usually- to 
work through people. Sometimes such people sense that they are being 
used; sometimes not.   Fifteen years ago, troubled by the rising 
tide of materialism in the post-war world, a businessman and a minister 
asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine 
in which men and women, regardless of creed or color, could set 
forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power 
of faith to solve the endless problems of living.   The businessman 
was Raymond Thornburg. The minister was Norman Vincent Peale. 
Neither had any publishing experience, but they had faith in their 
idea. They borrowed a typewriter, raised about $2,000 in contributions, 
hired a secretary, persuaded a couple of young men to join them for 
almost no pay **h and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets 
that they called Guideposts.   Compared to the big, established 
magazines, my first efforts seemed feeble indeed. But from the 
start they had two important ingredients: sincerity and realism. The 
people who told the stories were sincere. And the stories they told 
were true.   For example, early in my life, when one of my editorial 
workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations 
met the needs of New York's down-and-outers, he didn't 
just ask questions. Len LeSourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk 
derelict for ten days.   That was nearly 13 years ago. Len 
LeSourd is my executive editor today.   Many of you are familiar, 
I'm sure, with the story of my early struggles: the fire 
in January, 1947, that destroyed everything- even our precious list 
of subscribers. The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere. 
The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me.

That was when a remarkable woman, Teresa Durlach, came to my 
aid- not so much with money, as with wisdom and courage. "You're 
not living up to your own principles", she told my discouraged people. 
"You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim. 
What do you want- a hundred thousand subscribers? Visualize 
them, then, believe you are getting them, and you <will> have them"!

And the 100,000 subscribers became a reality. And then 500,000. 
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation.

With our growth came expansion into new fields of service. Today 
more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees. They 
say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to 
meet. Hundreds of civic clubs, business firms and individuals make me 
available to school teachers throughout the land. They say it helps 
them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this 
country was built.   Thousands of free copies are sent each 
month to chaplains in the Armed Forces, to prison libraries and to hospitals 
everywhere. Bedridden people say I am easy to hold- and read. 
Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition 
for blind readers.   Throughout these exciting years I have been 
fortunate for, although I have never offered great financial inducements, 
talent has found its way to me: William Boal who so ably organizes 
business operations; John Beach who guides circulation; 
Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business 
firms.   Searching for the best in spiritual stories, my 
roving editors cover not only the country, but the whole world. Glenn 
Kittler has been twice to Africa, once spending a week with Dr& 
Albert Schweitzer. Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were 
in Alaska. Van Varner recently returned from Russia.   Twice 
a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper, 
then a long evening of idea-exchange. Around the table sit Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jew. Each contributes something different, and something 
important: Ruth Peale, her wide experience in church work; 
Sidney Fields, years of experience as a New York columnist; Catherine 
Marshall LeSourd the insight that has made her books world-famous 
and Norm Mullendore, the keen perception of an advertising 
executive.   There are people who travel long distances to assure 
my continued existence. Elaine St& Johns may fly in from the West 
Coast for the editorial staff meetings. Starr Jones gets up every 
morning at five o'clock, milks his family cow, attends to farm chores, 
and then takes a two-hour train trip to New York. Arthur Gordon 
comes once a month all the way from Georgia.   We have also 
seen the power of faith at work among us. Rose Weiss, who handles all 
the prayer-requests that we receive, answering each letter personally, 
has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering: she has had 
many major operations, and now gets about in a limited way on braces 
and crutches. Recently, John Sherrill was stricken with one of the 
deadliest forms of cancer. We prayed for John, during surgery, we 
asked others to pray; all over the country a massive shield of prayer 
was thrown around him. Today the cancer is gone.   Perhaps it 
is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all. But, you 
see, those who are not mentioned will not resent it. That is the kind 
of people they are.   Perhaps you think the editorial meetings 
are solemn affairs, a little sanctimonious? Not so. Serious, yes, 
but also much laughter. Sharp division of opinion, too, and strenuous 
debate. There are brain-wracking searches for the right word, the best 
phrase, the most helpful idea. And there is also something intangible 
that hovers around the table. A good word for it is fellowship. 
A shorter word is love.   Each meeting starts with a prayer, offered 
spontaneously by one member of the group. It takes many forms, 
this prayer, but in essence it is always a request for guidance, for open 
minds and gentle hearts, for honesty and sincerity, for the wisdom 
and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers.   For you, 
readers, are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that 
is Guideposts. I need your support, your criticism, your encouragement, 
your prayers.   I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts. 
My message, today, is the same as it was 15 years ago: that there 
is goodness in people, and strength and love in God.   May He 
bless you all.

HAVANA was filled with an excitement which you could see 
in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices. 
The hated dictator Batista had fled. Rumors flew from lip to lip 
that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana, coming from the mountains 
where he had fought Batista for five years. Already the city was 
filled with Barbudos, the bearded, war-dirty Revolutionaries, carrying 
carbines, waving to the crowds that lined the Prado.   And 
then Castro himself did come, bearded, smiling; yet if you looked closely 
you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips.

At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper 
behind this man. I am sure that Castro was happy, too, about that support. 
<Diario de la Marina> was the oldest and most influential paper 
in Cuba, with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny. My 
grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials. My own earliest 
memories are of exiles: my three brothers and I were taken often 
to the United States "to visit relatives" while my father stayed 
on to fight the dictator Machado.   When it was my turn, I, too, 
printed the truth as I knew it about Batista, and rejoiced to see 
his regime topple. None of us was aware that the biggest fight was 
still ahead.   I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana. 
Within a week, however, I began to suspect that something was 
wrong. For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom, but hatred. He spent 
long hours before the ~TV spitting out promises of revenge. He 
showed us how he dealt with his enemies: he executed them before 
~TV cameras. On home sets children were watching the death throes 
of men who were shot before the paredon, the firing wall.   Castro's 
reforms? He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance. New 
schools were rising, but with this went a harsh proclamation: any 
academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid. 
Economic aid? He had promised cheaper housing: arbitrarily he cut 
all rents in half, whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator 
or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room. Under 
another law, hundreds of farms were seized. Farm workers had their wages 
cut almost in half. Of this, only 50 cents a day was paid in cash, 
the rest in script usable only in "People's Stores".

A 
suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist. In my mind, 
I began to review: his use of hate to gain support; his People's 
Courts; his division of society into two classes, one the hero, 
the other the villain. But most disturbing of all were the advisers 
he called to sit with him in the Palace; many came from Communist 
countries.   What should I do about it, I asked myself? 
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon. There 
was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him, mobs would appear outside 
our windows shouting "Paredon! Paredon! **h"   What 
should I do? I was proud of the new buildings which housed <Diario> 
now: the rotogravures, gleaming behind glass doors; the thump 
and whir of our new presses. Here was a powerful, ready-made medium, 
but it could speak only if I told it to.   Then one day, early 
in January, 1960, I sat down at my desk, and suddenly I was aware 
of the crucifix. It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had 
given me. I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind 
me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner. 
Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness 
in His eyes, saying:   "You will lose the paper. You may 
lose your life. But do you have any choice"?   I knew in that 
moment that I did <not> have any choice. From that day on I began 
to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in 
Fidel Castro's regime. 
@   Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly 
either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to "lift all 
those old barbell things" because "you'll stunt your growth" 
**h or because childish taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey **h 
lookit Mr& America **h whaddya gonna do with all those muscles (of 
which he has none at the time)"?   After all, a guy's gotta 
have a little ego!   Therefore it's a genuine pleasure 
to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has <never> had 
to train in secret **h has <never> heard one unkind word from his parents 
**h and <never> has been taunted by his schoolmates! 
This happy, always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new 
<Junior Mr& Canada>- Henri de Courcy.   Far from discouraging 
Henri, his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments. 
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they 
personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority, 
Professor Roland Claude.   And they couldn't have entrusted 
Henri to better hands because "le professeur" knows his muscles 
from the <sterno-cleido mastoideus> of the neck right down to the <tibialis 
anticus> of the leg **h and better still, he knows just what 
exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine 
them with for fast, <fast> muscle growth.   That's because the 
good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal 
Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt& Royal East in Montreal. 
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning 
pupils (every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other). 
There's Gaetan d'Amours who is our newest <Mr& Canada> 
**h Jean-Paul Senesac, whose story appeared here two issues ago 
**h Jack Boissoneault, who was with us last month **h Charles Harve, 
who recently won the "Most Muscular Man" subdivision award 
in the {Mr& Canada} event **h and a host of others. Yesiree **h 
the professor knows his muscles!   Now when Henri was just 
12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds, 
and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight. About that time 
he began reading {Mr& America} and {Muscle Builder} 
and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining. Seeing 
so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value 
of {Quick-Wate} and {Super-Protein}, those two wonder-working 
Weider food supplements, he decided to try them and see what they 
could do for him.   Well, sir **h they did real great! For 
in almost less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight was 
increasing rapidly. Of course he did some exercising **h he's crazy 
about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction 
with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle 
on his skinny frame.   Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming 
and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much. 
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body. It was muscular 
but it wasn't symmetrical. "A real 'nothing' torso", says 
Henri. "It never seemed to widen **h it just got longer and longer".

That's when he went to Professor Claude. And at 
once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct 
it. In his gym the professor has some of the most "knocked out" equipment 
since Vic Tanny. Mr& Claude is a specialist in torso development 
and he has long favored the now-famous Weider {Push-Pull 
Super-Set} technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is 
a {pressing} or "pushing" movement which accents one sector of 
a muscle group in a specific way, followed by a "pulling" exercise 
which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.   So 
right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous "moon" bench 
and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting 
of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover (the "pull" part of the 
Push-Pull Super-Set) which dramatically widens the ribcage and 
strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest **h and the 
collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to 
build those wide, Reeves-type "gladiator" ~pecs, while stimulating 
the upper ~lats and frontal deltoids.   As you can see, 
in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is 
vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises **h so 
the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   Now when 
Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 1, 
the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting 
him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 2.   Super-Set 
No& 2 is made up of similar exercises, but this time done 
with dumbbells, and using both "moon" and flat benches. The "push" 
exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done 
with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of 
the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation. You need the 
barbell variation to build width and mass in the ~pecs **h the dumbbell 
variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the ~pecs.

The "pull" exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell 
Bent-Arm Pullover. 
(Note how strongly 
the upper ~lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise 
because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation 
affords).   In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the "push" 
exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the "pull" 
exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms.

The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage 
stretcher ever invented! This is true {only} if a very wide grip 
is used and {only} when the {greatest possible stretch} is 
achieved. You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because 
your shoulder blades will touch! As you see, the professor has designed 
a piece of apparatus that {forces} the bodybuilder to use 
a w-i-d-e grip **h he has to; he just can't do anything about it at 
all!   But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise 
at all, because Henri de Courcy- the "happy" bodybuilder- 
looks as though he were having the time of his life!   The last 
exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single 
exercise, done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between 
sets. By this time Henri's entire chest-back-~lat-shoulder area 
is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to 
do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work. He has Henri do 
from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press (note the high incline). 
This gives a wide flare to the ~pecs, causing them to flow 
dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the 
serratus and ~lats.   This is the kind of chest that invariably 
wins contests **h that steel-edged "carved-out-of-solid rock" looks 
of the great champions.   So with four complete Push-Pull 
Super-Sets No& 1, four of No& 2, four of No& 3 and four to 
six sets of the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri de Courcy 
has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping, torso-defining 
workout that cannot be improved upon. 
@   Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone **h 
rarer still is a <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> of true Herculean 
build. The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' 
eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry 
and that hallmark of the true champion- <superior definition> 
of the muscles.

Now <good> definition is one thing that all of us can 
acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight workouts. 
But <contest> definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every 
muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's 
chisel- is something quite different. This comes not alone 
from high-set, high-rep training, but from certain definition-specialization 
exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge 
of exactly what works best for <him>.   Often these exercises 
work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others. 
Because they are "minority" exercises and have but a limited 
appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten. Only 
when the newest <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> rediscovers 
them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and 
once again see how effective they really are.   The exercise I 
shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle 
definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the One 
Leg Lunge. Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say 
because it works perfectly for <everyone>, no matter whether he has 
short or long thigh-bone lengths!   It is the one exercise 
that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the {hipline}- 
that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other 
bodybuilders **h a criterion of muscle "drama" that is unforgettable 
to judges and audiences alike **h the facet of muscular development 
that wins prizes.   Definition of the thighs at the uppermost 
part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which 
is easily understandable. The One Leg Lunge is a {split} and 
all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.   But for 
purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular 
Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor programs- a heavy weight is 
not needed. Indeed, a lighter weight works much better because a greater, 
more extensive split can be performed. Used in several sets of 
high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire 
upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look 
like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin!   Really 
there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way 
into your leg program at all times, for the following suggestions show 
why it is so effective: _1._ It's a {complete} thigh contraction-extension 
exercise. _2._ It places terrific tension on 
the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition. _3._ It 
improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder, and helps 
to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed. _4._ It 
increases flexibility of the legs. _5._ It speeds muscle growth 
and power development even for the {advanced} bodybuilder because 
each hip and leg is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated 
effort to be focused on each.   You'll need your Weider 
Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's 
done: _1._ Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their 
height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders 
when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean. _2._ Place 
a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar (which will 
rest against the back of your neck); extend your feet forward and 
backward until you are in a deep leg split.   Now raise the weight 
by {straightening} your {front} leg, {without moving your 
feet}. When the front knee is straight and {locked}, allow it 
to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the 
sides of the Power Stands. _3._ After you have taken a breather, 
{reverse} the position of your legs so that the {front} thigh 
of the {previous} exercise is now to the {rear}, and the 
{rear} thigh now to the {front}, and perform the same movement 
in the same manner.   That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell. 
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you 
make your first 
experiments **h just for safety. You should also begin 
this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed 
to it balance-wise.   Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit 
at first. But don't worry. Before your first training experiment 
has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it 
you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!

Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the {back} of 
the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments 
with the bar held in {front} of the neck. Squat-style lifters and 
leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those 
variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the 
{left} and {right} leg to the {front}.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bed of pansies I've seen was in a South 
Dakota yard on a sizzling day. Pansies are supposed to like it 
cool, but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring 
sun. I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce 
such beauties in that weather. He seemed puzzled by my question. 
"I just love them", he said.   The more I talked with him, 
the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous 
blooming. Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care. 
He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from a pansy specialist. 
These specialists, I learned, have done a great deal of work to 
improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers. Their 
seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the 
unimproved strains.   I asked him if he took seeds from his own 
plants. Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he wanted 
more of he did; but pansy seeds, he told me, soon "run down". It's 
best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.

His soil was "nothing special", just prairie land, but 
he had harrowed in compost until it was loose, spongy and brown-black. 
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the 
right texture, tilth and body. It isn't easy to describe it, but every 
gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.   Nothing 
is easier to grow from seed than pansies. They germinate quickly, the 
tiny plants appearing in a week, and grow along lustily. It doesn't 
really matter which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate 
best when they have a wide variation of temperature, very warm followed 
by cool in the same 24 hours.   I like to make a seedbed 
right in the open, though many people start them successfully in cold 
frames. Pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things 
rugged, with only moderate protection on the coldest days. If you 
do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.

For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to 
encourage rooting. I dig it, rake it smooth, sow the seeds and wet them 
down with a fog spray. Then I cover the sowing with a board. This 
keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds. Ants carry away 
the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.

When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board. A 
light, porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft 
during these early days of growth. I like sawdust for this, or hay.

When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants, it's 
time to set them out where they are to remain. Every time you transplant 
a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller. The moral is: 
don't transplant it any oftener than you must. As soon as they 
are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches apart where they are 
to bloom. I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed 
bone meal into each hole with the plant. That encourages rooting, and 
the better developed the roots, the larger and more plentiful the flowers.

Pansies are gluttons. I doubt if it is possible to overfeed 
them. I spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that, 
decayed manure spread over the bed is fine. One year I simply set the 
plants in the remains of a compost pile, to which a little sand had 
been added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my, or any of my 
neighbors' experience. In addition to the rich soil they benefit by 
feedings of manure water every other week, diluted to the color of weak 
tea. As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved in water 
to half the strength in the directions, may be used.   They 
need mulch. We put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use 
a heavy one. Three inches of porous material will do a good job of 
keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.   When winter comes 
be ready with additional mulch. I like hay for this and apply it 
so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost. That 
keeps in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate 
freezing and thawing.   Don't miss the pansies that appear 
from time to time through the winter. Whenever there is a thaw or 
a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or 
two. If those aren't enough for you, why not grow some just for winter 
blooming? The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February 
during a particularly cold winter. I started the seed in a flat 
in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame. (An unheated 
greenhouse would have been better, if I had had one.) The plants 
took zero nights in their stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over 
the glass to protect them. In response to the lengthening days of February 
they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers. That 
cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a 
border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it. Like 
strawberries in December, pansies are far more exciting in February 
than in May. Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold 
and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.

The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your plants becoming 
"leggy", running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms. 
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth, using a bobby 
pin to hold it there. Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and 
each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little 
plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season. As soon as an experimental 
tug assures you that roots have taken over, cut it off from 
the mother plant.   A second and also good practice is to shear 
off the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each 
branch. These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time 
and will behave just as they did in early spring. I like to shear half 
my plants at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while the 
second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.   Probably 
no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to 
let the blossoms go to seed. Nature's aim, different from ours, is 
to provide for the coming generation. That done, her work is accomplished 
and she ignores the plant.   Here is a word of advice when 
you go shopping for your pansy seeds. Go to a reputable grower, preferably 
a pansy specialist. It is no harder to raise big, healthy, blooming 
plants than weak, sickly little things; in fact it is easier. But 
you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.   Many 
people think that pansies last only a few weeks, then their period 
of growth and bloom is over. That is not true. If the plants are cared 
for and protected over the winter, the second year is more prolific 
than the first.   Would you like to grow exhibition pansies? 
Remove about half the branches from each plant, leaving only the strongest 
with the largest buds. The flowers will be huge.   Pansies 
have character. They stick to their principles, insist upon their 
due, but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it. Treat 
them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except 
the frigid ones. Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and more 
food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.

A SALAD WITH 
greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition 
to a meal, but add an avocado and you have something really special. 
This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past 
thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible 
to ship avocado anywhere in the United States. It has a great 
many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part 
of your diet yet, you really should.   You will find that avocado 
is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted. It is roughly shaped 
like a large pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin covers 
a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe 
Bartlett pear, but oily. The avocado should have a "give" to it, 
as you hold it, when it is ripe. The flavor is neither sweet, like 
a pear, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland, nut-like. 
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not 
because it is unpleasant, but because the flavor is hard to define in 
the light of our experience with other fruits. Sometimes it takes several 
"eatings" of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste 
that has made it such a favorite throughout the world. Once you become 
an avocado fan, you will look forward to the season each year with 
eager anticipation. 

#NATURALLY DORMANT AND NO SPRAY DANGER#

Today, 
refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible 
to any place in the world. The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, 
but it is still firm at this point. It is brought to packing houses, 
cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed in protective 
excelsior. The fruit is then cooled to 42`F&, a temperature at which 
it lapses into a sort of dormant state. This cooling does not change 
the avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening of 
the fruit until a grovelike temperature (room temperature) is restored. 
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.   One 
of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require 
processing of any kind. There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing 
needed. If the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado will delay 
its ripening until needed. And unlike other fruits, one cannot eat 
the skin of the avocado. It is thick, much like an egg plant's skin, 
so that poison sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the 
consumer. 

#NUTRITIOUS AND A CHOLESTEROL REDUCER#

Good taste and 
versatility, 
plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend 
the frequent use of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were 
limited. Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients. Their main 
asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining 
the good health of the circulatory system. Aside from this, 
the average portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount of vitamins 
~A and ~C- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement, 
and about a third of the official vitamin ~E requirement. The 
~B vitamins are well represented, especially thiamin and riboflavin. 
Calcium, phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts, 
and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts. 
None of these values is destroyed, not significantly altered by refrigeration 
storage.   Dr& Wilson C& Grant, of the Veterans' 
Administration Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University 
of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if avocados, 
because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids, would reduce 
the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients. The study comprised 
16 male patients, ranging in age from 27 to 72. They were put 
on control diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal cholesterol 
level of their blood. Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados 
per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.

FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, FIRE! The tremendous energy 
released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than 
it can be heard. The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the 
pit of your stomach.   Never before has the introduction of a weapon 
caused so much apprehension and fear. Nuclear weapons are fearsome, 
but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless 
swiftness which is much more terrifying.   A great many writers 
are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker 
would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear 
rockets. It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that 
an attacker, in possession of such absolute power, would simultaneously 
destroy his opponent's cities and people. With a nation defenseless 
before it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people? 
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical 
act of complete subjugation? The nation would be utterly devastated. 
The will of its people, so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.

Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction 
in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means 
to destroy itself in minutes. At this point it should be painfully obvious 
that cities, being "soft", and the people within them are ideally 
suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.   However, because 
this vulnerability is mutual, it is to the advantage of neither side 
to destroy the opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent 
has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal. It should be appallingly 
apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.

~ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in 
two different ways. They could be used to attack a nation's people 
(which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people), 
or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military 
force.   If our national interest lies in being able to 
fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide, then we must 
take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles. We must 
determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves. We must make 
certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job 
to the missile.   Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they 
also have their too little known limitations.   Because of a missile's 
ballistic trajectory, the location of a fixed target must be 
known quite accurately. Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads, 
highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them with 
passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range 
ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying 
a mobile or moving target with such weapons. One must first <detect> 
a fleeting mobile or moving target, <decide> that it is worthy of 
destruction, <select> the missile to be fired against the target, 
<compute> ballistics for the flight, and <prepare> the missile for 
firing.   Even if all these operations could be performed <instantaneously>, 
the ~ICBM still has a time of flight to the target 
of about 30 minutes. Therefore, if the target can significantly change 
its location in something less than 30 minutes, the probability of 
having destroyed it is drastically lowered.   Because of this, 
it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic 
missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile 
defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.

In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving, or imprecisely 
located strategic forces, we must have a hunter-killer capability 
<in addition> to our missiles. Until this hunter-killer operation 
can be performed by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only 
means available to us.   It seems reasonable that if general 
nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's 
citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance 
aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and 
destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us. 
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ~ICBM 
force. It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the ~B-52 
or ~B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based 
missiles. If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton 
nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which 
may be more appropriate for most important military targets, it would 
seem that the ~B-52 or ~B-70 could carry a great many small 
nuclear weapons.   An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons 
could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains 
operating within a specified geographic area of Russia- provided that 
we had used some of our ~ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses 
before our bombers got there. The aircraft could be used to destroy 
other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets as well as 
the known, fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by 
missile.   Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important 
role for manned military aircraft? Is there any other way to do 
the job?   Survivability of our strategic forces (Polaris, 
mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan, and airborne 
Skybolt) means that it will take some time, perhaps weeks, to destroy 
a strategic force. War, under these circumstances, cannot be one 
massive exchange of nuclear devastation. Forces <will survive> a surprise 
attack, and these forces will give depth, or considerable duration, 
to the conflict. ##

THE forces which survive the initial 
attack 
must be found and destroyed. Even mobile forces must be found and 
destroyed. But, how does one go about the job of finding and destroying 
mobile forces? They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction 
by ballistic missile.   Some day, many years in the future, true 
spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets. But until 
we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to the hunter-killer 
problem is manned aircraft.   However, the aircraft which we have 
today are tied to large, "soft" airfields. Nuclear rockets can 
destroy airfields with ease. Here then is our problem: aircraft are 
vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions 
which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield, 
on which the aircraft is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile. 
This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission, weapon. 
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.

This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft 
in favor of the missile. But remember this- it isn't the <aircraft> 
which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets, it is the <airfield>. 
Eliminate the <vulnerability of aircraft on the ground> and you 
have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic 
missiles.   There are <four rather obvious ways> to reduce or 
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:   @ Put 
aircraft in "bomb-proof" hangars when they are on the ground.

@ Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small (3,000-foot) 
airfields with runways. If we could use all the small airfields 
we have in this country, we could disperse our strategic aircraft 
by a factor of 10 or more.   @ Use nuclear propulsions to keep 
our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their 
useful life.   @ Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines, 
develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (~VTOL) long-range 
military aircraft.   We have the technology today with which to 
build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 ~psi. We 
could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters. 
Large, 
long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability 
to take off from 3,000-foot runways, but they would require more powerful 
engines than we have today. There is little enthusiasm for spending 
money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief 
that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.   This 
same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted 
in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft. 
One seldom hears the analogy "nuclear propulsion will do for 
the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine".   If, 
for some reason such as economy, we are not going to develop aircraft 
nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency, then we should 
turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio 
of 12 or 15 to one. With powerplants such as these, vertical takeoff 
and landing combat aircraft could be built. For example, a 12-to-one 
engine would power a <supersonic> ~VTOL fighter. With a 15-to-one 
engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise 
vertically. The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to 
develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a 
billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft 
are obsolete.   When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields, 
they are no longer vulnerable to ~ICBMs. If our ~SAC 
bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and 
<because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability 
to strike at Russia again, and again, and again>, those bombers would 
unquestionably assure our military dominance.   We would have 
the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it 
were fixed or mobile. With such a force of manned bombers we could bring 
enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure would be 
selective and extremely discriminating. No need to kill an entire city 
and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance 
to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.   Our first 
necessity, at the very outset of war, is post-attack reconnaissance. 
In a few years we will have ~SAMOS (semiautomatic missile observation 
system). But in the case of moving targets, and targets which 
have limited mobility, what will their location be when it is time to 
destroy them? What targets have we successfully knocked out? A 
ballistic missile cannot, today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful. 
What targets still remain to be hit? These crucial questions 
must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance. ~SAMOS will 
be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark. 
Even if this is some day possible, there remains the 30-minute time 
of flight of a missile to its overseas target. If the target can change 
its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in 
the air on its way, the probability of the missile destroying the target 
is drastically reduced.   <Pre>-attack reconnaissance is vital 
but only <post>-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate 
the war favorably. It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather 
that post-attack reconnaissance. It could operate under the clouds 
and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night. 
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately 
destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile 
to come all the way from the United States with the chance that 
the target, if it were mobile, would be gone.   A large aircraft, 
such as the ~B-52 or ~B-70, could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small 
nuclear weapons. Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive 
power will create 1,000 ~psi overpressure at 100 feet. Or 
put 
another way, the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed 
by placing a one-kiloton warhead (1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki) within 100 to 200 feet of the target!

It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large 
yield nuclear weapons.   Today we have side-looking radar which 
has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual 
buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate spans of bridges, etc&. 
With these keen "eyes" and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy, 
military forces can be directly attacked <with minimum damage 
to urban areas>.   If we fail to develop the means to hunt down 
and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision, 
and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace, 
our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.

THE LYRIC BEAUTIES of Schubert's <Trout> Quintet- 
its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source 
of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners. But for students of 
musical forms and would-be classifiers, the work presents its problems. 
Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the 
category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument 
generally regarded as symphonic. Moreover, the piece is written 
in five movements, rather than the conventional four of most quintets, 
and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.   The 
many and frequent performances of the <Trout> serve to emphasize 
the dual nature of its writing. Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions, 
with the contrabass given free rein. Other interpretations present 
the music as an essentially intimate creation. In these readings, 
the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background, or it 
is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in 
a china shop. Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches, 
when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer 
than ten different performances. The occasion for this marathon: 
Angel's long-awaited reissue in its "Great Recordings of the 
Century" series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version. Let me say at 
the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as 
it did on the first.   Whether considered alone or in relation 
to other editions, ~COLH 40 is a document of prime importance. 
Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart 
players of all time, and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable. 
But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great 
performer, and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to 
are by Schnabel pupils (Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian Aeschbacher, 
and Victor Babin) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical 
skills. Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian 
renditions, most notably the "Schnabel trill" (which differs 
from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously). 
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction 
as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each 
student's approach as distinctly his own.   Schnabel's emphasis 
on structural clarity, his innate rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous 
intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one. Yet no 
detail was too small to receive attention from this master, and as a 
result the playing here has humor, delicacy, and radiant humanity. This 
is a serious-minded interpretation, but it is never strait-laced. And 
although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously 
faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications. 
The piano performance on this <Trout> is one that really demands 
a search for superlatives.   About the Pro Arte's contribution 
I am less happy. I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't 
collaborate with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic 
playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook 
than the style of the Belgian group. From a technical standpoint, 
the string playing is good, but the Pro Arte people fail to enter 
into the spirit of things here. The violinist, in particular, is very 
indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched and edgy. 
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone, 
but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very 
quiet. There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation 
in the "<Forellen>" movement, and I suspect that this is 
due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original ~SPs.

Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's (London) offers 
the most sophisticated keyboard work. Every detail in his interpretation 
has been beautifully thought out, and of these I would especially 
cite the delicious <la^ndler> touch the pianist brings to the fifth 
variation (an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese 
musicians), and the gossamer shading throughout. Some of Curzon's 
playing strikes me as finicky, however. Why, for example, does he favor 
<two> tempos, rather than one, for the third movement? The assisting 
musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in <expertise>, 
but their contribution is rustic and appealing. (Special compliments 
to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp: his scrawny, 
tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance.)

The Glazer-Fine Arts edition (Concert-Disc) is a model of lucidity 
and organization. It is, moreover, a perfectly integrated ensemble 
effort. But having lived with the disc for some time now, I find 
the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's 
(whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to 
be recorded) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's. 
Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound 
on his Decca disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating 
a copy of it.   The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet (Angel) 
and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet (~RCA Victor) editions 
give us superlative string playing (both in symphonic style) crippled 
by unimaginative piano playing. (Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's 
keyboard manner, but his playing is of limited insight.) Badura-Skoda-Vienna 
Konzerthaus (Westminster) and Demus-Schubert Quartet 
(Deutsche Grammophon) are both warm-toned, pleasantly lyrical, 
but rather slack and tensionless. Helmut Roloff, playing with a group 
of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in 
much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists. Telefunken 
has accorded him beautiful sound, and this bargain-priced disc (it 
sells for $2.98) is worthy of consideration.   Returning once again 
to the Schnabel reissue, I am beguiled anew by the magnificence 
of this pianist's musical penetration. Here is truly a "Great Recording 
of the Century", and its greatness is by no means diminished 
by the fact that it is not quite perfect. This recording surely belongs 
in everyone's collection. 
MUST records always sound like records?   From the beginning 
of commercial recording, new discs purported to be indistinguishable 
from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation. Seen 
in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones. 
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude, they supply the 
ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation 
of the original. On the basis of what they give us we can know how the 
young Caruso sang, appreciate the distinctive qualities of <Parsifal> 
under Karl Muck's baton, or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini 
created in his years with the New York Philharmonic.   Since 
the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago, 
the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold. In many 
cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational 
effects: the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning 
as the gap between sound and substance became clearer. Other 
innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing 
to acquire in time the status of classics. If we return to them today, 
we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them 
still pleasing.   Records sound like records because they provide 
a different sort of experience than live music. This difference is 
made up of many factors. Some of them are obvious, such as the fact 
that we associate recorded and live music with our reponses and behavior 
in different types of environments and social settings. (Music often 
sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something 
more comfortable than a theatre seat.) From the technical standpoint, 
records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey 
the true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity, pulse, and pitch 
of the original. Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion, 
although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced 
that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests. 
Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the fitting together of 
fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness, 
that makes records sound like records. The sound may be good; 
but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what you are hearing 
is only a clever imitation.   Command's new Brahms Second is 
a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather 
than a copy of one. Like the recent <Scheherazade> from London 
(HIGH FIDELITY, Sept& 1961), it is successful because emphasis 
has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than 
on creating sensational effects. Because of this, only those with 
truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the 
engineers' triumph.   The easiest way to describe this release 
is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg 
performance with minimal alteration of its musical values. The engineering 
as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness. The effect of 
the recording is very open and natural, with the frequency emphasis 
exactly what you would expect from a live performance. This absence of 
peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity, but 
it eliminates listener fatigue. A contributing factor is the perspective, 
the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained. The orchestra 
is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes, valve 
clicks, and other noises incidental to playing. Yet you feel the orchestra 
is near at hand, and the individual instruments have the same firm 
presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically 
perfect hall. Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation. 
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its 
full sonority; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer. The 
timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.

All of this would be wasted, of course, if the performance lacked 
authority and musical distinction. For me it has more of both elements 
than the majority of its competitors. Steinberg seems to have gone 
directly back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built his 
performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly 
what Brahms set down on paper.   Those accustomed to broader, 
more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react 
strongly when they hear this one. Without losing the distinctive undertow 
of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and the over-all performance 
has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect. 
The <Presto ma non assai> of the first trio of the scherzo is 
taken literally and may shock you, as the real <Allegro con spirito> 
of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet. In the end, however, 
the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way 
it sings. Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element 
which must dominate in this score, and he manages at times to create 
the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.   The 
engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result. Too 
many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody 
and its accompaniment. The Command technique invites you to listen 
to the depth of the orchestration. Your ear takes you into the ensemble, 
and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously 
were apparent only in the score. It is this sort of experience 
that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance 
for the home music listener. 
The first substantially complete stereo <Giselle> (and the only one 
of its scope since Feyer's four-sided ~LP edition of 1958 for 
Angel), this set is, I'm afraid, likely to provide more horrid fascination 
than enjoyment. The already faded pastel charms of the nai^ve 
music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts 
between ultravehement brute power and chilly, if suave, sentimentality. 
And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic 
impact and earsplitting brilliance, the recording sounds as though 
it had been "doctored for super-high fidelity". The home listener 
is overpowered, all right, but the experience is a far from pleasant 
one. As with the penultimate <Giselle> release (Wolff's abridgment 
for ~RCA Victor) I find the cleaner, less razor-edged 
monophonic 
version, for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness, the more 
aurally tolerable- but this may be the result of processing defects 
in my ~SD copies.

At the Westminster ~KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden, 
New York on the second day, the Finals of the Junior Class 
brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class. 
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far 
south as Kentucky. This year several entries from Canada were entered 
which made the Junior Class International.   Forty-six of 
the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present. It was interesting 
to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other 
classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class.

As has been the custom for the past several years, John Cross, 
Jr&, Bench Show Chmn& of Westminster, arranged for the Juniors' 
meeting before the Class, and invited two speakers from the dog 
world to address them. Over 60 Juniors, parents and guests attended. 

#MRS& WILLIAM H& LONG, JR& SPEAKS#

After the Juniors 
were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the 
Junior Class, Mrs& William H& Long, Jr& was introduced as 
the first speaker.   In her opening remarks Mrs& Long also 
welcomed the Juniors and stated, "There isn't any other show quite 
like Westminster. I know because this is my 37th year with hardly 
a break. Mrs& Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster 
which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably 
will not appreciate in full for a number of years.   Twenty 
years ago her daughter Betsey Long, then 13 years of age, won the 
Grand Challenge Trophy, Children's Handling Class (as they were 
called then) at Westminster. No sooner had Betsey come out of the 
ring than Mrs& Long walked into the Working Competition with 
Ch& Cadet or Noranda, another home-bred product, and won!

Speaking from long years of experience, Mrs& Long advised the Juniors: 
"<When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement>, 
STOP! Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings! When you and 
your dog step into the Junior ring, it should be just what the dog 
wants to do as much as what you want him to do. If you walk into the 
ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel it and give you 
a good performance! He knows your signals, what is expected of him 
and the way the Class is conducted, right up through the flash-bulbs 
of the photographers". 

#RIGHT ATTITUDE ESSENTIAL!#

"Take 
away your attitude", said Mrs& Long, "and what have you left? 
Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage- a sure sign 
that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop! Or a 
bored dog because you are more interested in something else- maybe 
the way you look, or the date you have after the Class, or you are just 
doing this to please the parents.   "The reason you are in 
the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most 
attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can 
produce. Aids sounds more like a Pony Club, or horsemanship classes- 
riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar!   "Your 
aids are your attitude, which comes through your voice, your hands 
and legs- voice to encourage, discourage or whatever the need may 
be; hands to guide or restrain; legs to produce motion and rate of 
speed. Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right".

Mrs& Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and 
stated, "Have fun! And may you all continue to show at Westminster 
in the years to come"! 

#HARVEY BARCUS, SECOND SPEAKER#

The 
second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of the Dog Writers 
Ass'n of America.   Mr& Barcus spoke on the subject of 
scholarships for Juniors- with which he is very familiar. Last year 
a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing 
Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000. He gave a resume of 
the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.

"Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and 
should be earnestly encouraged"! is one of Mr& Barcus' strong 
beliefs. He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should 
take a MORE ACTIVE part in encouraging the Junior Division!

In closing, Mr& Barcus also wished all the Juniors 
luck in their Class. 

#WESTMINSTER SHOW NOTES#

Instead of 3 a&m& 
in the past, the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 
p&m&. This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the 
show- a great advantage to them!   Before the Juniors entered 
the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved 
their dogs around the ring and set them up, they could relax with their 
dogs. From there on, each Junior was going to be judged individually. 
This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the 
Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour, 
45 minutes to judge the Class. 

#ANNE HONE ROGERS JUDGES 28TH FINALS# 

This year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged the 
Class. This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at 
Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.   As the 
Juniors entered the ring, Mr& Spring, the announcer, stated over 
the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster 
has held the Finals of the Junior Competition. Juniors competed 
last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club recognized 
shows to be eligible to compete in this Class- the Finals 
for the year. A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class 
was eligible.   (The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition 
is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen. Many 
adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class.)

It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 
4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered. A large number of these Juniors 
have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.

After the judge moved all the dogs individually, she selected 
several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring. She 
then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship. 

#INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION OF THE YEAR#

BETTY LOU HAM, 
age 
16, Holyoke, Mass&, showing an Irish Setter, was chosen as International 
Champion of the year. She was awarded the Professional Handlers' 
Ass'ns' LEONARD BRUMBY, SR& Memorial Trophy 
(named for the FOUNDER-ORIGINATOR of the Junior Classes.)

Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit 
last year. In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year, 
she also scored with an Afghan. 

#OTHER WINNERS#

SYDNEY LE 
BLANC, age 15, Staten Island, N&Y&, showing a Doberman Pinscher, 
was 2nd.   SUSAN HACKMANN, age 14, from Baltimore, 
Md&, showing a Dachshund, was 3rd. Last year Susan also placed 
3rd in the Finals at Westminster. From the records we keep- 
Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in 
both United States and Canada.   KAREN MARCMANN, age 16, 
Trapp, Penna&, showing a Keeshond was 4th.   Most Juniors 
who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only 
show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as 
well. 

#ENTRIES INCREASING- REQUIREMENTS RAISED#

In 1960, there 
were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes. Each year these shows have 
increased in entries. Next year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show 
Committee has raised the requirements so that a JUNIOR MUST WIN 
3 OR MORE JUNIOR CLASSES IN THE OPEN DIVISION ONLY TO QUALIFY FOR WESTMINSTER.

PERCY ROBERTS, a leading judge will not be 
at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest 
as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March. 

#JUDGING 
CLASS FOR INTERMEDIATES PROPOSED#

It has been suggested many times 
that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter 
the Junior Classes. For some time this writer has been suggesting 
a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years 
of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class.

Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester ~KC 
Show recently. Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class, 
but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day. The Intermediates 
in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners 
and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice 
of the Judge.   We suggested this Class in the horse world and 
it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows 
At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated 
that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success 
and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world. 
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given 
a chance. Last year Robert Harris, a leading Junior Handler entered 
the Dog Judging Contest (Junior) at the International ~KC 
of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior 
since the Class' inception. Juniors who attend this Chicago show 
should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help 
to them. 

#MORE VOLUNTEER HANDLERS NEEDED TO JUDGE#

Superintendents 
at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed 
Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition. The founder of 
the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr& 
(for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster) was an outstanding 
Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit 
in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.

Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew 
nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog. To 
overcome this unfair judging, the A&K&C& requires that a licensed 
Handler be present to judge the Class. If the superintendents 
do not receive more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested 
that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class. By recognizing 
and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world, all will 
be helping to create future dog owners. 

#OTHER AWARDS FOR JUNIORS# 

The Airedale 
Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier 
Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to 
the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition 
at any Show. The Kansas City and the Topeka ~KCs 
are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to 
win points for Westminster. The Rio Grande ~KC is also considering 
having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify 
with points for Westminster.   The American Pointer Club 
is still continuing to donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior 
Showmanship Classes with Pointers.

Traveling through the South- over 16,000 miles- with two 
Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten, we've worked up a 
regular routine for acceptance at motels.   My husband enters the 
motel office, signs up for a room, and them solemnly asks the proprieter 
if he accepts pets. "Puppies"? comes the suspicious question. 
"No", he replies, "full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken, 
and obedience-trained".   We've never been refused!

Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way 
spot, keep them under control in the room, and feed and bench them where 
they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.

In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin!

Many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again- has remembered 
us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.

So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the 
table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination. 
Is it that they don't care? Are they indifferent to the 
fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?

AT ONE TIME, to most Americans, unless they were fortunate 
enough to live near a body of navigable water, boats were considered 
the sole concern of fishermen, rich people, and the United States 
Navy.   Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening 
statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport. There 
are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States 
with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade. 
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960. Boating has 
become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining 
sea. Boats are operated in every state in the Union, with the heaviest 
concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West.

The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident, 
expectedly, in the areas where boats have always been found: the natural 
lakes, rivers, and along the nation's coastline. But during the 
last several years boats were launched in areas where, a short time 
ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for 
livestock.   Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources 
control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies of water represent 
a kind of glorious fringe benefit, providing boating and fishing 
havens all over the country.   No matter how determined or wealthy 
boating lovers of the Southwest had been, for example, they could 
never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake 
Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which resulted when the 
Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River. In 1959, according 
to the Engineers, Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial 
lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 
persons.   Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been 
created by bringing bodies of water to the people, means have been found 
to take the people and their boats to the water. Providing these 
means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000 
boat trailers now in use. It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty 
or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new, light, strong, 
easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any 
kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000. The sight of 
sleek 
inboards, outboards, and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways 
many miles from any water is commonplace.   Boatmen lucky enough 
to have facilities for year 'round anchorage for their craft, 
will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car, 
driving to the water, 
and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to 
the boat. Today, the boat, on its trailer, is brought to the gear and 
loaded at the door. Arriving at the waterside, the boat is launched, 
the family taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is begun.

And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be 
ten years ago. This year, Americans will discover previously unheard 
of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred 
of our nation's national, regional and local boat shows. The boats 
of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as 
they are hauled to new horizons.   The variety of craft on the 
country's waters today is overwhelming. They range from an eight-foot 
pram, which you can build yourself for less than $50, to auxiliary 
sailboats which can cost over $100,000. Boat prices vary according to 
the buyer's desires or needs. In this respect, boats can be compared 
with houses. There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is easily 
possible to keep within a set budget. There is no question as to 
just what is available. You name it, our industry is producing it, and 
it probably is made in different models.   There are canoes ideal 
for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips. There are 
houseboats which are literally homes afloat, accommodating whole families 
in comfort and convenience. You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped 
craft, sail, power, or both, or laze away a fine day in a small 
dinghy on a local pond.   You may have your boat of wood, canvas, 
plywood, plastic, or metal. You may order utility models, inboard or 
outboard, with or without toilets, galleys, and bunks. You may dress 
it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.

Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers 
who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena 
lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month 
ride around the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on all 
the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat. 
You pay your money and you take your choice.   American technology 
in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful 
interest in American boating. I wonder if anyone ever bothered 
to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors, Americans 
excel over any country in the world in the long run.   Russia, 
whose technology is not quite primitive, is still in the dark ages 
when it comes to improving the outboard motor, for instance.   Now 
here is truly a marvel. The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal 
range of one to 80 horsepower, unheard of a few years ago for a two 
cycle engine in quantity production. These engines can be removed 
from a boat with relative ease, wherein lies their greatest advantage. 
Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook, the 
range being about $150 to $1,000, depending on size.   Great 
thought 
has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population 
of the country; and to making the owning of a boat simpler. There 
was a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it was necessary 
for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he 
could touch the tiller or wheel. Having a boat financed through a local 
bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended. 
Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer 
areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.

Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down 
payments run about the same as for automobiles. Of course, individual 
financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning 
power, credit rating and local bank policy.   Outboard motors, 
insurance, and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as 
boats. Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those 
for home appliances.   When the automobile was in its embryonic 
stage, such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit 
understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about 
the only rule governing where, when and how fast a car could go. When 
air travel was in its infancy, the sky was considered big enough and 
high enough for all. Man had enough to worry about managing to get 
up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft. It was 
much the same with pleasure boating at first. Come one, come all, the 
water's fine!   As the ungoverned days of the automobile 
and the airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is the carefree 
attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do; must and should 
do. However, there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.

Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the 
craft is to be used and according to its horsepower. What may be acceptable 
in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line. 
The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according 
to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally 
used. If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure 
boats, you must apply for a number from the U&S& Coast Guard for 
any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower 
before it can be used on Federal waterways.   State numbering 
laws differ from each other in many ways. Fees are not the 
same 
and some states do not require certain craft, such as sailboats with 
no power, to be registered at all. Many states have laws regulating 
the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age 
of motor boat operators.   Generally, states reserve for communities 
the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities. 
It is always wise to consult your marine dealer, local yacht 
or boat club secretary, or local law enforcement officers if you are 
not positive what the regulations are. Ignorance of the law is no better 
excuse on the water than it is on land; lack of ability and common 
sense can lead to just as much tragedy.   Hand in hand with 
the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed 
safety program. Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the 
rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting an intense, 
coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.

A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the 
enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers. The industry 
has been its own watch dog. With U&S& Coast Guard cooperation, 
the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended 
practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference 
to safety.   Industry interest in safety goes even farther. 
In 1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National 
Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance 
underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service 
for boats and their equipment. A new waterfront site for the bureau 
is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to provide the 
most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the 
sport safe.   In addition to these activities, the ~NAEBM, 
with headquarters at 420 lexington Avenue, New York City, as well 
as other associations and individual manufacturers, provide and distribute 
films, booklets, and public services in regard to proper boat handling 
and safety afloat.   It is important to note the work of 
the United States Power Squadrons and the U&S& Coast Guard 
Auxiliary. Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in 
seamanship piloting and small boat handling. These are not governmentally 
subsidized organizations. This year, over 100,000 persons will 
receive this free instruction.   As America on wheels was responsible 
for an industry of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments 
where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank deposit, 
the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries 
designed especially to accommodate them. Instead of motels, for 
the boatman there are marinas.   The word marina was coined by 
~NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational 
boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative 
comfort. Currently, marina is used to indicate a municipal or 
commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and findsome 
or all of the following available: gasoline, fresh water, electricity, 
telephone service, ice, repair facilities, restaurants, sleeping 
accommodations, a general store, and a grocery store.   Yachtel, 
a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront type of hotel where 
a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises 
as well as other services. Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel. 
It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically 
to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as 
outboards. Regardless of nomenclature, yachtels and boatels are marinas.

Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities 
may rightfully be called marinas.   A recent survey disclosed there 
are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and 
boatyards in the United States, the majority of which are equipped 
to handle outboard boats. 
THE design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical 
puzzle, but once understood, the principles can be applied to 
any track and signal arrangement. In the frame are two sets of bars 
which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous 
moves. The main set of bars are the "tappets" and one tappet 
is connected to each lever. If the lever is pulled to clear a signal 
or move a switch, the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at 
the same time.   Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking 
bars. These can also move a short distance but at right angles 
to the tappets. The number of locking bars required depends on how many 
false moves must be prevented.   In the sides of the tappets 
are notches with sloping sides, and connection between the tappets and 
locking bars consist of cams called "dogs". Two or more dogs are 
mounted on each locking bar. These slide into and out of the notches 
in the tappets as the tappets are moved, locking and unlocking them.

Here's how the scheme works: Suppose the operator pulls 
the lever to clear a particular signal. This also pulls the tappet connected 
to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches 
to the side, thus moving one or more locking bars. The dogs on the 
other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other 
tappets. By this scheme, pulling one signal to clear locks all the 
other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal 
is again restored to normal.   Interlocking signals are normally 
at stop or "red" position, and a lever must be pulled to "clear" 
the signal. This is not necessarily to green, however, for in 
some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it 
into the "plant".   There are other basic rules. A turnout 
may have two levers, one to actually move the switch points, the other 
to lock the points. A signal cannot be cleared until all the related 
turnouts are properly thrown <and> locked. Such locks are nearly 
always used where the switch points "face" oncoming traffic. The 
lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that 
a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point. If the points aren't 
thrown all the way, the turnout cannot be locked, and in turn, 
the signal cannot be cleared. Generally, these locks on turnouts are 
called "facing point locks".   Figs& 1-6 show typical arrangements 
of track and signals. Each diagram is accompanied by a "dog 
chart", a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular 
lever will lock if pulled. The lines connecting the wedge-shaped 
dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.

By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several 
other details. Derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide 
the wheels off the rails if a train passes a "stop" signal- are 
used in many instances. "Home" signals have two blades. The blacked-in 
blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move. As 
an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal 
is seen in advance when he passes the "distant" signal located 
beyond the limits of the interlocking plant. In some low-speed situations, 
the distant signal is fixed at caution. In other instances where 
there is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only green 
and yellow aspects.   So much for the prototype.   The interlocking 
frame we built at the MODEL RAILROADER workshop and then 
installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig& 1 scheme 
and is shown beginning in Fig& 7, page 65, and in the photos. Here's 
how it can be built. 

#FRAME#

The sizes of pieces needed 
for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig& 7, most 
of the bars being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths. 
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers 
and locks as you wish. Our instructions assume you are building 
this particular frame, which is for a junction.   When cutting 
the pieces, dress the ends smooth, and square with a smooth file or sanding 
disk. Start with the right-hand piece "~B", **f, soldering 
it to the lower piece "~A" of the same material but 12'' 
long. Let exactly 1'' of "~A" extend beyond "~B" and 
use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.   Now 
lay 12 pieces of **f cut 5-3/4'' long side by side but separated 
by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' sq&. This gives you the 
spacing for locating the left-hand piece "~B". Compress the assembly 
when you make the mark to show the location for "~B". Solder 
this second "~B" to "~A" at right angles. There 
should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be 
1'' from an end of the long piece.   Cap this assembly (with 
spacing bars in place) with a **f bar. Tack-solder all the 1/2'' 
sq& pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members. These will be drilled 
and tapped later on.   Now cut five **f locking bar spacers 
(which run horizontally). Position these using six intermediate temporary 
**f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar "~A". Solder 
it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame. Now place 12 pieces 
1/2'' sq& on this edge as we did before and space them with 
the 5-3/4'' long "tappets", as they are called. Cap with a **f 
bar and tack-solder in place. Cap the locking bar spacers with two 
**f directly under the first two "~B" pieces. Remove all the 
loose spacing bars.   Mark and center-punch all the holes required 
for screws to hold this assembly together. See Fig& 7. Placement 
of these holes is not critical, but they should be located so that 
the centers are about 1/8'' from any edge. Drill all No& 50 and 
counter-drill all except the "~A" pieces size 43. Tap the "~A" 
pieces 2-56.   Now unsolder and disassemble the frame 
except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ("~A" 
and "~B" pieces), which are soldered together. Either lay 
the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters 
so they may be replaced in their proper positions. Dress all surfaces 
with a file, cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.

Drill 20 No& 47 holes in the upper piece "~A" as shown in 
Fig& 7. Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later 
on. Note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.

Now reassemble the frame, using **f roundhead steel screws and nuts. 
Put the 12 tappets and some **f locking bar spacers in the frame to 
help align all the components before you tighten the screws. Be sure 
the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq& spacer. As 
an anchor for the spring lock, insert a **f bar in the lower left corner 
of the frame as shown in Fig& 7. Drill a No& 43 hole through 
the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw. Drill two No& 50 
holes, one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly 
above it, and tap 2-56. Number all the tappet bars before removing them 
so they can be replaced in the same slots. Remove all other loose 
pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth. Cut five pieces 
of **f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long. These are supporting members 
for the short locking bars. Locate their positions in Fig& 7 and 
drill No& 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame. Cut off 
excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut. Drill 
four No& 19 and four No& 28 holes in the 12'' long "~A" 
pieces. Locate the position from Fig& 7. 

#TAPPETS AND LOCKING 
BARS#

Draw-file No& 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective 
slot and square the ends. Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree 
chamfer. Drill a No& 50 hole 1-1/4'' from one end and tap 
2-56. (See Fig& 7.) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole, cut 
off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar. 
To find the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into the frame 
and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge. Scribe a line 
across the bar on the other end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the 
diameter of the 2-56 screw head (about 5/64'') away from the frame 
edge. Total distance is about 21/64''. Tend to make this dimension 
slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 
1/4'' tappet movement. Drill a No& 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert 
a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end. Drill a No& 
47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in 
Figs& 
7 and 8. Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet 
bars.   To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a **f piece of 
brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs& 6 and 8. These 
will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.   Fitting 
the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job 
since stop screws, tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced 
many times. As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become 
a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before 
the part you are working on is accessible. A little extra work 
here will pay off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are finished. 
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work 
progresses to insure snug fitting.   The order of fitting is not 
too important. However, we started with the first row of bars and worked 
our way back. Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs 
and notches is used throughout, we will only describe the construction 
of one locking bar. Figs& 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions. 
All the bars are cut from **f brass. The lengths of each piece are 
listed at the bottom of Fig& 7. Bar "~C" is 2-3/4'' long. 
Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put a slight chamfer 
on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.   Fig& 8 gives 
the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes. Center-punch and drill 
the No& 31 hole 7/16'' from one end of the bar. Chuck a length 
of 1/8'' dia& drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning 
device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file 
a slight taper 1/8'' long. Cut the piece about 9/32'' or 5/16'' 
long and drive it into the No& 31 hole drilled in the locking 
bar. File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' 
above the bar. This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.

Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3. 
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of 
tappet 3, parallel to piece "~A". See the drawings for the shape 
of the notch. Scribe ~V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out 
with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool. We used 
the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .020'' thick and 
1'' dia& fitted on a 1/8'' dia& mandrel. Such disks are 
very handy for cutting and shaping small parts. File to a smooth finish. 
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular 
shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without 
marring an adjoining one. Endeavor to get the notches as much alike 
as possible. The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel 
dog will slide easily over it. Assemble the parts in the frame and 
test the sliding action of the mating pieces. All matching surfaces 
should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis. 
Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia& drill rod in a 
drill press or 
electric hand tool. Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' 
long on one end, using Swiss pattern files. This tool can also be 
made with a lathe.

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on 
mathematics. Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes 
of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round 
would not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and communicating 
the things they discover and learn. Math and the formulas that 
allow it to be applied to different problems are, therefore, essential 
to any scientific endeavor.   Hot rodding is a science. It's 
not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate 
on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit 
but it is, nevertheless, a science. But because science is based on mathematics 
doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician. 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years 
without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems; 
however, he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and 
the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few 
formulas that apply to rodding.   A mathematical formula is nothing 
more than a pattern for solving a specific problem. It places the 
various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation 
to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can 
be computed.   The first step in using a formula is to insert the 
numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions 
in the formula. This changes the formula to an "equation". The 
equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.

Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated. They involve 
only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic 
classes. However, it is essential that the various mathematical symbols 
used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes 
can be done properly and in their correct order. They indicate 
simple division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.   The 
symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers 
placed one above the other. The lower number is always divided into the 
upper number: **f   The symbol for multiplication is "~@". 
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row. For example: 
**f Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any 
order. The result will be the same regardless of the order used.

The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign. This is 
nothing more than a dash. It separates two or more numbers. The number 
on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on 
the left of the symbol. For example: **f When more than two figures 
are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried 
out from the left to right if the result is to be correct. For example, 
for the problem **f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals 
9.   Addition is indicated by the ~+ symbol. The symbol is 
used to separate two or more numbers. For example: **f Numbers separated 
by addition symbols may be placed in any order.   When solving 
an equation that involves division as well as other steps, do all 
the division steps first 
to reduce those parts of the equation to their 
numerical value. Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can then 
be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left 
end of the equation and working toward the right. Completing the 
division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication, 
subtraction, or addition steps: **f This would be reduced 
by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12. This part 
of the equation would then become 4.   For use in formulas, fractions 
should be converted to their decimal equivalents. The easiest 
way to do this is with a conversion chart. Charts for this purpose 
are available from many sources. They are included in all types of mathematical 
handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision 
measuring instruments.   The various mathematical processes can 
be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places. 
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental 
effect on the accuracy of the final result.   Some formulas 
contain "constants". A constant is a number that remains the same 
regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant 
equation. It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved 
correctly.   Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport. 
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases 
and, 
quite often, are necessary for completing entry blanks for different 
events. When it is needed, one formula is as important as another. 
However, some formulas are used more than others. We'll take 
them in the general order of their popularity. 

#ENGINE DISPLACEMENT# 

A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine. 
Displacement is sometimes referred to as "swept volume". Most 
entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information 
because of class restrictions. It is good to be able to compute 
displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking 
can be computed.   Factors involved in the displacement formula 
are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length of the 
piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the engine, and a constant. 
The constant is .7854, which is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant 
known as "pi". Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions 
of circles.   Actually, the engine displacement formula is 
the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type 
with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the 
engine. The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and 
then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying 
the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent of the length 
of the cylinders. Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders 
in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.   The formula 
is: **f. Dimensions in inches, and fractions of inches will give 
the displacement in cubic inches. Dimensions in centimeters and fractions 
of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters 
(~cc). One inch equals 2.54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16.38 
cubic centimeters.   For example, let's consider a standard 
283 cubic inch Chevy ~V8. These engines have a cylinder diameter 
of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches. The formula, with 
the fractions converted to decimals, becomes **f.   To arrive 
at the answer, multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of 
the group and working to the right. The different steps will look like 
this: **f 

#COMPRESSION RATIO#

A cylinder's compression ratio 
is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume, or its displacement, 
with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber. 
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber 
volume must be measured with a liquid.   Cylinder volume is 
determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula: 
**f.   To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers 
in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark plug in the chamber 
and support the head so that its gasket surface is level. Then pour 
water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill 
the chamber to its gasket surface. Do not overfill the chamber. This 
is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension. 
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface 
around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.

The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting 
the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from 
the original quantity. Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters 
(~cc), making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches. 
However, the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic 
centimeters. The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will 
be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are 
used. The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be 
quoted in the same terms.   The volume of the cylinder opening 
in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square 
inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch. Sometimes 
it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening 
but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy 
that it won't affect the final computation. The volume of the opening 
is added to the combustion chamber volume.   Another thing 
that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between 
the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston 
is in top dead center position. Compute this volume by measuring 
the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately 
as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring 
device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth. The 
formula for this step is: **f This volume is added to the total volume 
of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening. The total of 
these three volumes is the "final combustion chamber volume".

After the factors just described have been computed, they are applied 
to the following formula: **f   For an example let's dream 
up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic 
inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches. Applying these figures 
to the formula we get the equation: **f The compression ratio is 
10 to 1.   This method of computing compression ratio cannot be 
used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly 
shaped heads. Any irregularity on the piston heads will make 
it impossible, with normal means, to determine the final combustion 
chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot 
be readily computed. The only way to determine the final combustion 
chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid 
while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston 
is in top dead center position. 

#GEAR RATIO- SPEED RELATIONSHIPS# 

There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships 
of car speed, engine speed, rear axle gear ratio, and rear tire 
size. By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can 
be determined for any combination of the other three.   To simplify 
the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of 
the factors. These are   ~MPH for Car speed   ~RPM 
for Engine crankshaft speed   ~R for Rear axle gear ratio

~W for Tire size   Tire size can be determined in 
several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is 
by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly. This 
is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire 
is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft. A tire must be inflated 
to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to 
its operating weight when this measurement is made. The measurement 
must be in inches. Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement 
must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics. 
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used 
in the formula.   To determine car speed for a given combination 
of engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula is: **f 
For an engine speed of 5000 ~rpm, a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1, and a 
tire radius of 13 inches, the equation would look like this: **f

To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three 
factors the formula is: **f Using the same figures as for the 
previous example, the equation becomes: **f   To determine the 
rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors, the 
formula is: **f Using the figures from the previous examples, the 
equation becomes: **f 

#ORLANDO, FLA&, FEB& 2#- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up 
to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner (Mainliner-Highland 
Ellen), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was 
clocked 2:25. She is owned by Ralph H& Kroening, Milwaukee, 
Wis&, who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly proud of her.

Other good miles have been by Debonnie (Dale Frost-Debby 
Hanover) and Prompt Time (Adios-On Time) in 2:28-:36; 
Kimberly Gal (Galophone-Kimberly Hanover) 2:26.2; Laguerre 
Hanover 
(Tar Heel- Lotus Hanover) and Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd) 
in 2:34~h. Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation- 
good body, plenty of heart girth, stands straight on his legs 
on excellent feet- and has the smoothest gait. This colt is behind 
most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show 
about as much pace as any of them. Monel shows improvement with each 
work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her 
share of races.   Stardel (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 
2:34~h, looks quite promising. Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay), 
Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover) and Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess 
Hanover) have been working together but have not equalled their best 
work done some weeks ago. Fury and Caper worked in 2:35~h and did 
it with ease. They are two good colts of different type. Fury is 
upstanding and on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type. 
I have never seen Caper off his feet- he seems to know nothing but 
'trot' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so. Fury 
has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect, with his 
impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.

Trackdown (Torrid-Mighty Lady) has worked a mile in 2:33.3~h. 
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace. Then, after 
emasculation, he was eased up for a couple of weeks. He has thrived 
on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race 
horse.   Thor Hanover (Adios-Trustful Hanover) is a wonderful 
looking prospect and another good individual, with solid, rugged conformation, 
good, flat bone and excellent feet. This colt arrived at 
the Raceway early last November, and immediately was put into harness 
and line-driven for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in 
very nicely, knowing nothing but trot. He appeared in the hopples about 
November 14, was treated for worms on the 18th, the latter date being 
the first time he struck a real pace. On December 5 he paced a mile 
in 2:55 on the twice-around, out in third position all the way. 
This colt has done everything asked of him, and done it with ease. His 
best mile to date is 2:32.2~h.   Gamecock (Tar Heel-Terka 
Hanover) is another promising colt, and his best time is 2:32.2~h. 
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center. 
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare; 
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff. The fourth time in 
harness he walked off like a gentleman. Being blistered for curbs has 
delayed his work somewhat. But up to date he has shown as much as any 
in the big Simpson stable.   Hustler (Knight Dream-Torkin) 
is a playful bay rascal of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely 
can pace and is right there with them, and sometimes leading them, in 
the best miles. Torrid Freight (Torrid-Breeze On Hal) is a very 
rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease 
everything asked of him. His best time is around 2:33.   Strongheart 
(Adios-Direct Gal), a fair-looking sorrel colt, knows nothing 
but pace and has been right there in the best miles. Torrid Adios 
(Torrid-Adios Molly) is not so masculine as most of the colts, 
but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers 
on the grounds. Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks, he is 
coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me. First Flyer (Frisco 
Flyer-Castle Light) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois 
Stakes. His best time is 2:33.2~h.   The colts in Simpson's 
stable have little if anything on the fillies, especially the 
pacers. Justine Hanover (Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover) is 
improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4~h weeks ago. 
Mrs& Freight (Knight Dream-Miss Reed) shows promise and does it 
in good form, and her best time is about 2:35. Hoopla (Tar Heel-Holiday 
Hanover), a filly that wanted to trot, knocked herself October 
31 and November 1 fighting the hopples. She was then trained on 
the trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart once around the 
half-mile track and hoppled again. This time she submitted and in 
a few days was going good. On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1-:38~h; 
on Jan& 18 2:37.3-:36.1~h; on Jan& 21, 2:36. 
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters, 
Valentine Day and Cerise- more scale and much better underpinning. 
She is more like her full brother, Taraday Hanover, but 
larger. Up to date she is a grand-looking filly.   Pete Dailey 
has four promising 2-year-old pacers. Marquis Pick (Gene Abbe-Direct 
Grattan) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time. 
He is a fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs and nice 
way of going. His best mile to date is 2:28-:33. Majestic Pick 
comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2. This colt is another 
fine-looking equine. Staley Hanover (Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover) 
is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks 
like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his 
class. Best time to date is 2:34-:34. Step Aside (Direct Rhythm-Wily 
Widow) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows 
promise.   Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked 
from 2:40 to 2:35. Bonnie Wick (Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary) has 
gone in 2:36~h; Hickory Ash (Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover) 
in 2:35. The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me 
and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself, "that 
must be Hickory Ash". She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot. 
Hickory Hill (Star's Pride-Venus Hanover) has gone in 2:33~h; 
Hickory Spark (Harlan-Hickory Tiny) 2:37~h; Buxton 
Hanover (Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover) 2:35; Faber's Kathy 
(Faber Hanover-Ceyway) 2:37~h; Honor Rodney (Rodney-Honor 
Bright) around 2:40. The last-named is a fine-looking, large colt, 
who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries. 
He is going sound again now, and looks good.   Brief Candle 
(Harlan-Marcia) has gone in 2:37~h; Lena Faber (Faber Hanover-Chalidale 
Lena) 2:33~h; Martha Rodney (Rodney-Miss Martha 
D&) 2:35~h; Checkit (Faber Hanover-Supermarket) 2:35~h; 
Charm Rodney (Rodney-The Charmer) 2:37~h; Fair 
Sail (Farvel-Topsy Herring) 2:36~h; Custom Maid (Knight Dream-Way 
Dream) 2:34.2~h; Jacky Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess 
Lorraine) 2:36~h; Good Flying (Good Time-Olivette Hanover) 
2:36~h; Bordner Hanover (Tar Heel-Betty Mahone) 2:34; 
Faber's Choice (Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet) 2:36~h; 
Invercalt (Florican-Inverness) 2:35~h; Duffy Dares 
(Meadow Gene-Princess Mite) 2:36~h; Harold J& (Worthy Boy-Lady 
Scotland) 2:36; Knightfall (Knight Dream-Miss Worthy 
Grapes) 2:36~h; Next Knight (Knight Dream-Next Time) 2:36~h; 
Trader Jet (Florican-My Precious) 2:37~h; Trader 
Rich (Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover) 2:37~h; Good Little 
Girl (Good Time-Mynah Hanover) 2:36~h; Iosola Hanover (Kimberly 
Kid-Isoletta Hanover) 2:36~h. The last-named is one 
of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her very much. I will 
be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future.

I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile 
in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3. In going away Debonnie got behind 
several lengths, stalling at the start- she is a little fussy. They 
left the three-quarters together and finished almost together. Prompt 
Time shows class. This filly is another Adios that wants to trot, 
and trot she did until forced to do otherwise. After well broken 
and equipped with 12~oz shoes on behind, bare-footed in front, she 
would trot a real storm with the master, Delvin, driving. Being placed 
in the hopples she was completely baffled. She hesitated, she hopped, 
she roll and rocked, skipped and jumped, but in some two weeks she 
started to pace, From that time to this she has shown steady improvement 
and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.

Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there were a few miles 
of note on Thursday. 
Those responsible included Stardel Hanover 
(Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 2:30-:34.3; Lorena Gallon 
(Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover), 2:30-:34.3; Prudent Hanover 
(Dean Hanover-Precious Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Premium 
Freight (Titan Hanover-Pebble Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Laguerre 
Hanover (Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover), 2:30.3-:36.1; Monel 
(Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd), 2:30.3-:36.1; Fury Hanover (Hoot 
Mon-Fay), 2:30.3-:36; Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover), 
2:30.3-:36; Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover), 2:30.3-:36; 
Lucky Freight (Knight Dream-Lusty Helen), 2:31.3-:35.3.

Sam Caton's Butterwyn (Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn), 
a light bay filly, knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile 
in 2:30-:36. Riverboat (Dalzell-Cousin Rachel) has gone in 
2:38~h. Sam is having his troubles with Layton Hanover (Dean 
Hanover-Lucy Hanover), but hope to have him straightened out and going 
before long.   Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet (Adios-Rena 
Grattan) and she sure looks good as she goes by. Her best 
time to date is about 2:30~h. He also likes Hampton Hanover (Titan 
Hanover-Bertie Hanover) 2:37~h. Cathy J& Hanover (Tar 
Heel-Kaola Hanover), formerly called Karet Hanover, has been rather 
a problem child, but it getting better all the while and can pace 
a twice around in about 2:31. Armbro Comet (Nibble Hanover-Mauri 
Hanover) has been in 2:38.   Flick Nipe's and Neil Engle's 
Miss Phone (Galophone-Prissy Miss) is a fine-looking filly 
with good disposition and good gait, and she has worked up to date in 
2:46. 

#DEL MAR, CALIF&, FEB& 3#- After 52 rainless 
days, moisture finally came to Del Mar, resulting in but one workout 
during the week for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than 
half our total average rainfall during the season.   While 2-year-olds 
are still gaining most of the attention at the track, green 
horses are starting to go a bit, and Jimmy Cruise has several that 
can really make it. Work-outs for the week are as follows: Plain 
Scotch, 3 (by Scotch Victor), Demon Law, 3 (by Demon Hanover), 
Coffee Royal, ~p (by Royal Blackstone) and Beauty Way, ~p, 3 
(by Demon Hanover) in 2:25; Eddie Duke, ~p, 3 (by Duke of 
Lullwater), Marilyn C&, ~p (by Sampson Hanover) and Chalidale 
Barry, 5 (by King's Ransom) in 2:20; Tiger Hanover, ~p, 
3 (by Adios) in 2:26; Sherwood Lass, 4 (by Victory Song) in 2:22; 
and Dauntless, 3 (by Greentree Adios) in 2:32. For the 
aged horses: Mr& Budlong, ~p, 2:00.2~h, Lottie Thomas, ~p, 
2:04.2~h, Mighty Signal 2:03, Clever Braden, ~p, 2:01.1~h, 
and Glow Star, ~p, 2:02.3 have been in 2:35; Miss 
Demon Abbe, ~p, 1:59.3 has trotted in 2:26, and is expected to 
race at this gait; Carter Creed, ~p, 3, 2:01.1, Great Lullwater 
2:00.3, and Hi Jay, ~p, 2:05.1~h have been in 2:30; 
Tanker T&, 3, 2:05.3 is now wearing hopples and has trained in 
2:19; Stormy Dream, ~p, 2:01.3~h, Demon Abbe, ~p, 2:02, 
Dundeen B&, 4, 2:04.2~h, Claudia's Song, 3, 2:06.3~h, 
and (jet Fire, 4, 2:02.2 have been in 2:25; Maria Key, 2, 
2:06~h looked great in 2:22; Mocking Byrd, ~p, 2:01.1~h 
has been in 2:12, with a racing date approaching at Bay Meadows.

Dewey Urban has a clever green trotter in Dr& Orin I&, 
3 (by Yankee Hanover), his latest mile in 2:20; Victory Sun, 
~p, 2:04 has trained in 2:24; Early Sun, ~p, 2:02.3, Chester 
Maid 2:05, Dark Sun, ~p, 2:06.1, and Sun Tan Maid 
2:05.2 have been in 2:21.

The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun (we 
ran a survey to find out) but he's always on the lookout for new and 
better arms. He's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's 
a real hunter and shooter, eager to improve his sport. Well, if you're 
that kind of sportsman we're here to help you. You've probably 
given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack, 
but it's not easy to decide on a new one. You still have time to 
drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time 
to decide on them is now. As a Christmas service, I've taken a close 
look at this year's crop of new models. Here they are, with my 
comments and judgments. Read on, take your pick- and start dropping 
those hints.   First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle 
and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense. 
For me, a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute 
a truly new design. Such modifications are all for the best but 
it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change 
arms-making concepts.   Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker 
(under $110) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the 
modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short, light, quick-handling, 
fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug 
at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for 
our most popular big game- whitetail.   Ruger reports that 
on his recent African safari the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a 
real work horse. Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot, 
and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob and wart hog with 
deadly efficiency; these are fairly large, tough animals. 
The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to 
me. At least five years ago, Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under 
double rifle for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model 
90 action in 20-gauge size. After figuring out how to regulate the 
barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this 
little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground 
test gallery. We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill 
Ruger in his first experiments: Three or four bullets would be 
placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, 
one could stray far out of the group.   Ruger learned that this 
was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting 
the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet. The new, jacketed slug 
in .44 Magnum corrected this. But even without jacketed bullets, I 
had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt 
that first year. Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that 
hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind 
the left foreleg at 60 yards. He moved only about 30 feet after 
the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed 
through a sapling.   Three more deer have fallen to this same 
gun, and all were one-shot kills. My double was made with standard-weight 
revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length), and although 
it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than 
the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.   If ever 
a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter, this is it. The Deerstalker 
points with the ease, speed and precision of a fine imported 
double shotgun, and its trigger pull is light and sharp. The 240-grain 
bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 ~fps, which gives it all the smash 
needed at woods ranges. With five shots at the immediate command 
of the hunter's trigger finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.

The second really new development this year was a revolver 
handling a different sort of varmint load- the .22 Remington Jet 
Magnum Center Fire. At present it's available in one model, the 
fine and familiar Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110), 
long a top-quality handgun among target arms. The velocity of this .22-caliber, 
40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 ~fps, and it's 
the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range 
rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range. This is a varmint load, 
pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game. 
It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry 
of feathers.   The most intriguing aspect of the ~S+W Magnum 
chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22 rim-fires 
by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers. You may therefore 
convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm, although the difference 
in the point of impact (Jet vs& rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting. 
The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested 
it in my scoped ~S+W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a 
chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun 
steadily. 

#HUNTING RIFLES, '61#

The fact that the Deerstalker 
and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't 
mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers. 
Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of hunting rifles have been 
introduced for the first time. Here are the brands (in alphabetical 
order) and the new models.   Newcomers to the American hunter 
are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles. They have 
fine ~FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal 
and the stock wood. Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various 
calibers available, and these include the standard bores (about $165) 
plus the Magnums (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300 
~H+H, .338, .375 and .458. Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard 
on all of the Magnums except the .264. Stock designs are excellent 
for use with scopes.   Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are 
all made with Sako actions, regardless of caliber. The .222's have 
the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action, and the .270, 
**f and the Magnums, the long action (about $135 for the Standard 
Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version). Previously, ~FN actions 
were used for the larger cartridges.   High standard has 
introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King, in two grades- field and special 
(less than $45 and just over $45, respectively). It's a streamlined 
rifle, fast and well-made.   Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire 
rifles, 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader 
(around $60). Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given 
this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the 
260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum rim-fires.

Marlin 
has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings. The 
Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight, streamlined .22 rim-fire auto 
with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles. It's extremely 
accurate for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely 
trouble-free in functioning. The 989 (about $40) is an even newer .22 
auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.   Once again the 
Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared, but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun 
combination. The bore is unrifled but is provided with an 
insert tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives pretty fair 
accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long. You can unscrew 
this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells- 
to break the little Targo clay targets. A trap for throwing 
these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can 
throw his own targets. A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular 
hand trap are also available. You can have your choice of a seven-shot 
repeater, the ~340TR (about $40) or a single-shot, the ~320TR 
($10 less).   The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting 
or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks 
to run up a score on the clay birds. They'll travel 50 feet or 
more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to 
break one after it passes the 35-foot mark. The combination of thin 
pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds, 
right now!   Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line 
for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of Model 
725's. These are made on special order only, in Kodiak grade 
(about $310), with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads; 
they weigh around nine pounds.   A shortened version of the 
highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961. This 
carbine (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has an 18-1/2-inch 
barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's 
Model 760 pump with a short-barrel. This design is hard to beat 
for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard. Presently, 
the ~742C is available in **f.   The latest versions of the famous 
Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the 
99 Deluxe (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger 
design. The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will 
make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new 
safety is easier and faster to operate. 

#BEGINNERS' GUNS, '61# 

A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're 
good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to 
get for a youngster. The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about 
$20, $5 for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot patterned 
after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western 
look. Because of its traditional lines, it probably has more kid 
appeal than any other model. The action is a drop-block, handling all 
the standard .22 rim-fires.   Marlin's latest is also designed 
for the beginning shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty 
of barrel weight and ample stock. This is the Model 122 (about 
$20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety- 
i&e&, the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun 
cocked for the next shot. Stock design is excellent, and this model 
is a good first gun. Another boy's model is the .22 single-shot Remington 
~514C (around $20), which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a 
short- 12-1/2-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.

A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year. 
The single-barrel Stevens ~940Y (under $35) is made with a side lever 
rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong 
enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does 
indeed open very easily. This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is 
available in either 20 or .410 gauge. There's another addition to 
the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which 
you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters 
like this gauge and type of scattergun too. 

#SHOTGUNS, '61#

Although 
there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year, 
a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit 
the market. For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed 
over/under, the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs 
from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore 
end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast 
sighting.   The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the Standard 
or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150, respectively) in 
12, 16 and 20.   Firearms International has introduced another 
import, this one from Finland. It's the Valmet (about $170), a 12-gauge 
over/under very much like the old Remington 32- which was 
so fine 
a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.   High 
Standard has also added two models to its line. The Supermatic Trophy 
(prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional 
features) is a 12-gauge auto. The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at 
just over $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16. Either model is a very good 
dollar value.   Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is 
the Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version of the old 
Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun. See page 24 for a complete 
report on it. 

#HANDGUNS, '61#

Aside from the .22 Jet- which 
I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two 
biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among 
1961's handguns.

LIVERY STABLE- J& VERNON, PROP"& Coaching had declined 
considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there, near the old 
Wells Fargo building in San Francisco, creaking in the fog as it 
had for thirty years. John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared 
for- he had prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom. Coaching 
was in his blood. He had two interests in life: the pleasures 
of the table and driving. Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the 
Santa Cruz road, upland and through the redwood forest, with orchards 
below him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the other. The 
journey back he made along the coast road, traveling hell-for-leather, 
every lantern of the tallyho ablaze.   The southward route 
was the classic run in California, and the most fashionable. His patronage 
on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans- regulars, 
most of them, and trenchermen like himself. They did not complain 
at the inhuman hour of starting (seven in the morning), nor of the 
tariff, which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco. 
Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in the 
mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa 
Cruz.   Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring, so 
halts were contrived between meals. Then the Chinese hostler, who rode 
with Vernon on the box, would break open a hamper and produce filets 
of smoked bass or sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree 
to be heated over a spirit lamp.   In spring and in autumn 
the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend 
of mine. They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and bits of 
resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which exists only on a forty-five 
mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains. In the Spanish 
days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense. 
It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar. 
Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips, but he could 
arrange no schedule with the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped 
off, and the botanists began to motor out by themselves. 
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular 
tallyho run. This was an honor, like dining with a captain at his private 
table. Vernon's office adjoined the stable, and the walls were 
adorned with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of the period. 
They advertised harness polish, liniments, Ball's Rubber Boots, 
Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla, patent medicines, 
shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.   The hostler would have the 
table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove; then a porter 
from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head. 
It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster 
salt roast and a mound of corn fritters. Vernon was consummately fond 
of oysters, and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil 
War. Oyster salt roast- oysters on the half shell, cooked on a bed 
of coarse salt that kept them hot when served- was a standby at Manning's. 
Its early morning patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves 
for the day with that delicacy.   In the 1890's the 
Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager, John 
C& Kirkpatrick. This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller 
made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace 
chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters. (Gastronomes 
have long argued about which came first, the Palace's or Antoine's. 
Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod 
on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding. The 
Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional.) Vernon, however, 
held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it, unadorned by herbs 
or any seasoning but salt, though he did fancy a bit of lemon. 
After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect the rig; this 
was merely a ritual, to please all hands concerned. The tallyho had 
cost Vernon $2,300. A replica of two coaches made in England for the 
Belmont Club in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it 
was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run. One could shave in 
the reflection of its French-polished panels, and its axles were greased 
like those of roulette wheels. The horses were groomed to a high 
gloss; departing, they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw, 
for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.   But 
for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip fell. The clients boarded 
the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven. They had been fed 
a hunting breakfast, so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified 
with fox hunting, was on the bill. There are many ways of making a 
kedgeree, every one of which is right. Here is an original kedgeree 
recipe from the Family Club's kitchen: 

#CLUB KEDGEREE#

Flake 
(for three) a cupful of cold boiled haddock, mix with a cupful of cooked 
rice, two minced hard-boiled eggs, some buttery white sauce done 
with cream, cayenne, pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of 
minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy. Heat and serve hot on toast. 
##

The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's chef, 
was even more in demand. For decades it was the most popular dish 
served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast, and it is one of the few 
old Palace dishes that still survive. Native California oysters, 
salty and piquant, as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a 
five-cent piece, went into it. The original formula goes thus: 

#OMELET 
ARBOGAST#

Fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with a tablespoonful 
of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs, pepper, 
celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives, a dash of cayenne, and a 
pinch of nutmeg. A jigger of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture 
stiffens, in go a hundred of the little oysters.   Louis Sherry 
once stayed a fortnight at the Palace, and he was so pleased with omelet 
Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York. 
J& Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco, 
to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the restaurateur 
with him. As things happened, Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill 
residence of a magnate friend, whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved 
talent. Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused himself 
as best he could. Twice he left everything to his entourage, and 
fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance.

In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its tiers of Moorish 
galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's 
station was at the entrance. It was a post of honor, held inviolate 
for him; he had the primacy among the coachmen. Of majestic build, 
rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled the late General Winfield 
Scott, who was said to be the most imposing general of his century, 
if not of all centuries. Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia, 
and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly.

Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in 
the tallyho. He had style: he held his reins in a loose bunch at the 
third button of his checked Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned 
at a curve, as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them. 
They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until the coach reached 
Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin.   The road 
maps of the region have changed since 1905; inns have burned down, moved 
elsewhere, or taken other names. Once on the road (and especially 
if the passengers were all regulars and masculine), the schedule meant 
nothing. An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of 
the tallyho, from which there issued clouds of smoke. Vernon would tilt 
his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard, 
indulging in a huge cigar. The horses moved at a clump; they were no 
more on parade than was their driver; one fork of the road was as 
good as another. The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties, 
and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed 
columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes the Santa Clara 
valley below at the left. The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts 
of fernery. You arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted 
not to bring a mackintosh.   Vernon kept an account book 
with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage. 
A number of them must have fallen into disfavor; they were 
struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing both the cooks and the 
management. He was copious in his praise of those that served food that 
was good to eat. The horses seemed to know these by instinct, he used 
to say: such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins.

There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees, its wide 
verandas strewn with rockers. Many of its sojourners were devoted 
to seclusion and quiet, and lived there to the end of their days. It 
was 
the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods. Acorns 
from the great oaks fed the small black pigs (akin to Berkshires), 
whose "carcass sweepstakes" were renowned. Their ham butts, cured 
in oak-log smoke, were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served 
with this original sauce: 

#WRIGHT'S DEVIL SAUCE#

Put into 
a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy, or of the boiled ham liquor, 
with a half stick of butter, three teaspoonfuls of made mustard, 
and two mashed garlic cloves. Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato 
and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime. After this has simmered 
an hour, add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire, catsup, and 
chutney, two pickled walnuts, and a pint of Sherry. Then simmer fifteen 
minutes longer. ##

Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made 
and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar, so 
that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.   Vineyards 
and orchards also grew around Wright's, and deer were rather a nuisance; 
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers. But 
no one complained when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison 
pies. No one complained of the white wine either: at this altitude 
of two thousand feet, grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint. 
(The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height.) Apple 
trees grew there also. Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains 
flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring, the apples that 
grow there have a wintry crackle.   Dwellers thereabouts preferred 
to get their apple pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven 
fired with redwood billets. The merit of the pie, Vernon believed, 
was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven. The recipe, 
which he got from the baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically 
this: 

#WRIGHT'S APPLE PIE#

Peel, core, and slice across 
enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin, and set aside. In a 
saucepan put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount of sugar, 
a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam, a pinch each 
of clove and nutmeg, and a large bay leaf. Let this boil gently for 
twenty minutes, then strain. Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve 
minutes, drain them, and cool.   Set the apples in the pastry-lined 
tin, spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter, 
with as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a fresh bay leaf, 
then lay on a cover of pastry, and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.

THOSE WHO have never traveled the width and length of this 
land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook description alone, the 
overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one 
government. The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most 
strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the 
Midwest; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains; the 
smoke-filled, art-filled, drama-filled life of the great cities of the 
East; the lush and historic charm of the South. Now, to add to the 
already unbelievable extremes found in one nation, we have the two 
new states of Hawaii and Alaska.   To hope to cover just one 
region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and, of 
course, to bring back pictures of your experiences, requires advance planning. 
For this reason, <U&S& Camera> has prepared this special 
U&S&A& vacation feature. We divided the country into five 
regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general 
description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events 
to cover. Any special photographic requirements are also given.

Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation 
in photogenic America. 

#THE NORTHEAST#

BIRTHPLACE of the 
nation, the Northeast offers historic battlefields; lovely old villages 
and a rugged seashore among its many worthwhile sights. The rolling 
farms of Maryland, the peerless metropolis of New York City, 
the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included in your Northeast 
vacation.   By automobile from New York, for example, you can 
take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis, Maryland to see the colonial 
homes and the U&S& Naval Academy (where you can shoot the 
dress parade on Wednesdays); to Washington, D&C&, for an eye-filling 
tour of the city; or to Lancaster, Pa&, the center of 
the Pennsylvania Dutch country; Philadelphia with its historic buildings 
and nearby Valley Forge; to West Point, N&Y&, the 
famous military academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River.

New England deserves as much of your vacation time as you can 
afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing wonderful beaches, artists' 
colonies and quaint townships. From here you can easily include 
a side trip to the old whaling port of Nantucket, Massachusetts, 
which looks just as it must have two centuries ago.   At Sturbridge 
Village, Massachusetts, you'll find a completely-restored New 
England town. North to Acadia National Park, Maine, with views 
of a rockbound coast and dark, magnificent forests.   One of the 
most exciting ways to end a Northeast vacation would be with a week 
in New York City. Return through New England, stopping for a visit 
to Lake Champlain where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan 
Allen Park. There you'll witness a view which includes the Adirondack 
Mts& and the Winooski River.   Now you're ready for 
a whirlwind sightseeing tour of America's most exciting city. The 
skyline, the bridges, Broadway, and the Staten Island ferry are 
only a few of the spots to put on your "must" list for New York 
City. 

#PHOTOGRAPHING IN THE NORTHEAST#

Some tips for shooting in 
Northeastern locales: In New York City don't miss coverage 
of the United Nations. These striking, modernistic buildings on the 
East River are open to the public and every weekday guided tours are 
available. Pictures can be taken in the public areas and when on tours. 
However, the use of tripods is not allowed. Photos of Conference 
Rooms and the General Assembly Hall can be made when these rooms 
are not being used for meetings. Flash is allowed, subject to above 
restrictions.   Around New England, you'll no doubt want a 
color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses. Be careful here not 
to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and 
light-reflecting. 
In color, 1/50th of a second between **f and **f will do for 
bright, frontal sunlight. 

#THE SOUTH#

THE SOUTHERN United 
States, extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west, 
still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance. 
It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty 
encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation, on the one hand, to places 
where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided 
for the tourist with camera.   Of special interest this anniversary 
year of the war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields 
where, likely as not, you'll catch some memorial re-enactments. 
Among the locales to visit are Shiloh, Tennessee; Lookout Mountain, 
Tennessee; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Richmond, Virginia; 
Petersburg, Virginia, and Fredericksburg, Virginia.   Florida 
provides tropical scenes unequalled in the United States. At 
Cypress Gardens special bleachers are set up for photographers at water-ski 
shows and lovely models pose for pictures in garden settings. 
Silver Springs features glass-bottom boat rides and in Everglades National 
Park there are opportunities to photograph rare wildlife. Miami 
Beach and surroundings feature fabulous "hotel row", palm-studded 
beaches plus the Miami Seaquarium and Parrot Jungle. 
One of the most delightful spots in a southern tour is the city of New 
Orleans. The famous old French and Spanish buildings with their 
elaborate wrought iron balconies and the narrow streets of the Latin 
Quarter present an Old World scene.   For restoration of early 
American life the places to visit are Williamsburg, Jamestown and 
Yorktown, Virginia. Another Virginia sight and a photographic adventure 
are the Luray Caverns, lit by photofloodlights.   The 
great state of Texas offers metropolitan attractions such as the Dallas 
Fair Park with its art and natural history museums. In contrast 
are the vast open stretches of ranch country and oil wells. In San 
Antonio visit the famous Alamo and photograph 18th Century Spanish 
buildings and churches.   The Great Smoky Mountains is another 
area of the South well worth a visit. Along the 127-mile route through 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park you can photograph the 
breath-taking peaks, gorges and valleys which come into view at every 
turn. Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is the center of this area. Another scenic 
spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens 
are not to be missed.   Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks 
of the South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston, 
S&C&, Natchez, Miss&, and Savannah, Ga&. At Charlottesville, 
Va&, shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the 
University. 

#PICTURING THE SOUTH#

Foliage is the outstanding photo 
subject in many of the Southern locales mentioned above and some 
specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in order. For example, 
the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, sponsors special 
camera tours into the Great Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the 
profusion of wild flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.

Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting 
results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches. 
Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight 
or shade. In any instance, you should determine the exposure according 
to the type of light which falls on most of the subject area.

Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast 
with the many long-view scenics you'll be making.   For 
shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make 
sure your equipment includes a tripod. Enough daylight is usually 
available from the windows, but if you have synchronized flash- use 
it.   For some unusual photographic subjects, if your vacation takes 
you nearby, try these events: the 600-mile auto race in Charlotte, 
N& C&, on May 27; the Florida Folk Festival, White Springs, 
May 5-7; Singing on the Mountain in Linville, North Carolina, 
on June 25. Peak action photography is your goal at Miami's 
Seaquarium and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events. 

#THE 
MIDWEST#

A PLEASANT start to your midwestern vacation is a few 
days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago. Lake Michigan offers swimming 
and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches. A visit to Chicago's 
museums and a stroll around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold 
many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer.   Wisconsin 
Dells, where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin River 
are overgrown with fern and other foliage, rates a stopover when 
traveling from Chicago.   The farmlands forming the heart of America 
stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago. In North Dakota 
the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its 
wonder on to film. While here, visit Theodore Roosevelt National 
Park for its spectacular scenery.   Another spot with an image-provoking 
name is the Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier 
mining town of Deadwood. The Black Hills Passion Play is produced 
every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting. 
Of course, while in this vicinity you won't want to miss a visit to 
Mount Rushmore National Memorial where on the side of a mountain 
are the famous sculptures of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson 
and Theodore Roosevelt.   In Missouri (which we are including 
in our general Midwest region) you can glance into Mark Twain's 
birthplace at Hannibal, see the landmarks of his life and writings 
and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief.

Similarly in Illinois there is Lincoln country to be seen- his 
tomb and other landmarks.   Minnesota, fabled land of waters, is 
in itself, ideal vacationland, 
having within its borders 10,000 lakes! 
Itasca State Park, where the Mississippi River begins, is one 
of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota.   Mementoes of the 
Old West recall the days of Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, Nebraska, 
where present-day cowboys add a colorful human interest note to your 
vacation shooting.   Of current interest is Abilene, Kansas, 
the birthplace of ex-President Eisenhower. There's a museum here 
and also Old Abilene Town, a reconstruction of the cattle boomtown 
of the 70's and 80's.   For a resort area, Mackinack Island, 
Michigan, is the place to visit. It truly relives another age for 
the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and old British and 
French forts are left intact for tourists to visit and record. 

#PICTURES 
OF THE MIDWEST#

Night scenes will add an exciting touch to 
your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along 
Chicago's Lake Shore Drive? Just after sunset is a good time 
to record the city lights in color since you get a "fill-in" light 
from the sky.   Another memo for sightseers: bring your camera 
along to museums. Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit 
will add depth and background to your vacation photo story. Again, 
be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures.

Special events and their dates which will make interesting 
shooting in the Midwest area, include the following:   A re-enactment 
of the Battle of Lexington, May 18th at Lexington, Missouri; 
the world-renowned 500-mile auto race at Indianapolis, Indiana, 
plus a festival from May 27-30; "Song of Hiawatha", in 
Elgin, Illinois, from June 20 to 24th. Michigan offers the lovely 
Tulip Festival in Holland, Michigan, May 12-14; the ~USGA 
Open in Birmingham from June 15-17; and the International Freedom 
Festival in Detroit, June 29-July 4.   For early vacationers 
there's the fun-filled Fishing Derby in Hot Springs, Arkansas, 
April 19-23, and the Arkansas Band Festival in Hot Springs, 
April 20-22. 

#THE WEST#

A WESTERN VACATION is practically 
synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks 
in this area. A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week 
vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can 
be of equal reward.   In California is located one of the most 
popular of the national parks- Yosemite. Among its most spectacular 
features are its falls, the highest being Upper Yosemite which drops 
2,425 feet. The Sequoia Grove presents another unique aspect of 
Yosemite, for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.

In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon 
National Park. Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful 
formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in 
both parks.   Colorado's Grand Canyon, probably the most famous 
landmark of the United States, can be the highpoint of your Western 
vacation.

BUILT UPON seven hills, Istanbul, like Rome, is one of 
the most ancient cities in the world, filled with splendor and contrast. 
It is an exotic place, so different from the ordinary that the casual 
tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness 
of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses. At the moment, many 
of these are being pulled down. Whole blocks are disappearing and more 
are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will 
show off its treasures to better advantage- the great domes and graceful 
spires of its mosques, the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden 
Horn. Even when they are finished, however, the contrast will 
remain, for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon 
two continents. For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed 
shoulders in its streets.   Founded in the Ninth Century B&C& 
it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas, ruler of 
the Megarians, expanded the settlement and named it after himself. About 
a thousand years after that, when the Roman Empire was divided, 
it became capital of the Eastern section. On May 11, 330 A&D&, 
its name was changed again, this time to Constantinople after its 
emperor, Constantine. In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman 
power fell to the Turks, the city officially shifted religions- 
although the Patriarch, or Pope, of the Orthodox Church continued 
to live there, and still does- and became the capital of the Ottoman 
Empire. When <that> was broken up after the First World War, 
its name was changed once more. Rich in Christian and Moslem art, 
Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that 
recently 
became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on 
the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the 
center of town. Easy to get to, and becoming more popular every year, 
it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World 
Airways jet, four hours from Rome. 

#START OF TOUR#

Most of the 
sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern 
hotels. I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist 
Office, next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter 
the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel. From there I turned 
left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left, 
Republic Gardens, and came in a few moments to Taksim Square, one 
of the hubs of the city, with the Monument of the Republic, erected 
in 1928, in its center.   Directly across from the Gardens I 
found a bus stop sign for ~T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus, 
with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and 
the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that. There 
the bus turned right along the Bosphorus, past ocean liners at anchor, 
to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep 
of water that empties into the Bosphorus. Across the bridge on 
the left I saw St& Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the 
right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque.   On 
the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square, 
with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque, which dates from the Seventeenth 
Century, just across from the entrance to the bridge. Passing it, 
the bus climbed a hill, with the covered spice bazaar on the right and 
Pandelli's, a famous and excellent restaurant, above it. At the 
top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park. I got 
off there, crossed the street, walked ahead with St& Sophia on my 
left, the Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the entrance 
of St& Sophia.   Erected on the site of pagan temples and 
three previous St& Sophias, the first of which was begun by Constantine, 
this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed 
twenty years later. On his first trip to the finished structure 
he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem. 
A few years later the dome fell in. Nevertheless, it remained 
one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire, where 
the Byzantine Emperors were crowned. After the Turks conquered the 
city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets. 
In the second half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect 
who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive buttresses 
that now help support the dome. With the birth of the Turkish 
Republic after the First World War, St& Sophia became a museum, 
and the ancient mosaics, which were plastered over by the Moslems, 
whose religion forbids pictures in holy places, have been restored.

Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which shows 
Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering 
the temple. On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques 
with Arabic writing. The eight green columns, I learned, came 
from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the others, red, from the Temple 
of the Sun at Heliopolis.   Beneath the dome I saw the 
spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned, a bit of floor protected 
now by a wooden fence. Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit 
and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork, where the emperors 
and, after them, the sultans, sat. Directly opposite is the emperor's 
door, through which they entered the building.   Outside 
St& Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it, with 
the Blue Mosque ahead on my left. Across the street on my right I 
saw the Hippodrome, now a park. It was laid out in 196 for chariot 
races and other public games. Statues and other monuments that stood 
there were stolen, mostly by the waves of Crusaders.   At 
the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain, an 
ugly octagonal building with a glass dome, built in 1895 by the German 
Emperor, and on my left, directly across from it, the tomb of Sultan 
Ahmet, who constructed the Blue Mosque, more properly known by 
his name.   Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed 
the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead to the Obelisk 
of Theodosius, originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 
B&C& by Thutmose, who also built those now in New York, 
London and Rome at the Lateran. This one was set up here in 390 A&D& 
on a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues of 
the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome, done so 
realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them.   Beyond 
it I noted a small green column, about twelve feet below the present 
ground level- the Serpentine Column, three entwined serpents, 
which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece. Near 
the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated 
obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that once rivalled 
the Colossus of Rhodes. 

#MAGNIFICENT MOSQUE#

Retracing my steps 
to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only one with six minarets, I entered 
the courtyard, with a gallery supported by pointed arches running 
around it and a fountain in the middle. One of the most beautiful 
buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth 
Century, with a huge central dome, two half domes that seem 
to cascade down from it, and smaller full domes around the gallery. 
The round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular bases and 
have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer. 
Inside, the walls are covered with blue and white tile, the floor 
with red and cream carpets.   Back at the Kaiser's Fountain, 
I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill- any 
car will do- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the Burnt 
Column, at the top on my right. It stands in the middle of what 
was once the Forum of Constantine, who brought it from Rome.

I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning right, it entered 
a huge square, Bayezit, with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and 
the gate to the university just beyond it. There I got off, crossed 
the square, and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good 
restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the city. Called the Marmara 
Gazinosu, it is on the third floor, with signs pointing the way 
there, and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara. After lunch, 
in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a 
pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava- a sweet, flaky cake- 
in Istanbul. It's a great favorite of the university students, 
and I joined them there for dessert.   Taking the streetcar back 
to Kaiser's Fountain, I walked ahead, then left down the street 
opposite St& Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small, 
one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the entrance to the 
Sunken Palace. Actually an underground cistern, its roof supported 
by rows and rows of pillars, it was built by Justinian in the Sixth 
Century to supply the palace with water. There is still water in it. 
I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately. 
Outside I walked past the entrance to St& Sophia, turned left at 
the end of it, and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead. Just 
before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks 
somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering in gold and 
colored tile decorations- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet.

Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall, I entered the grounds 
of Topkapi Palace, home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast 
Ottoman Empire, and walked along a road toward another gate in the 
distance, past the Church of St& Irene, completed by Constantine 
in 330 A&D& on my left, and then, just outside the second 
gate, I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right- the Executioner's 
Spring, where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading 
his victims.   Passing through the gate, with towers on either 
side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square surrounded by 
buildings, and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds, 
with explanations in English for each building. There are a 
good many of them. At one time about 10,000 people lived there.

Following arrowed signs, I veered right toward the former kitchens, 
complete with chimneys, which now house one of the world's greatest 
collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner 
services. Next to it is a copper section, with cooking utensils 
and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate, floor-length robe.

In the court once more, I went right toward the Reception House, 
a long one-story building with a deep portico. Going through a door 
into another small court, I had the Throne Room directly in front. 
I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated 
manuscripts and came to the Treasury, which houses such things as coffee 
cups covered with diamonds, jewelled swords, rifles glittering with 
diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds, on which 
the sultans sat cross-legged. They are made of gold and covered with 
emeralds, pearls and other jewels.   Taking the path behind 
the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it, the Portrait Gallery, 
I went right at the end of it, through a garden to a small building 
at the back- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans, its 
floor covered with carpets, its ceiling painted with gold squares and 
floral designs.

<DO> start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain 
a 
lasting bed of glowing coals. Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next 
to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot, and to stop flames that 
arise from melting grease.   <Do> line barbecue fire bowl 
with 
heavy foil to reflect heat.   <Don't> forget to buy a plastic 
pastry brush for basting with sauces. Clean it meticulously in boiling 
water and detergent, rinse thoroughly.   <Do> build a wall 
of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued 
on an electric spit. Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the 
hood for heating vegetables, sauces and such.   <Don't> 
fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly 
larger than the surface of steaks and chops. Sear on both sides then 
cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results.

<Do> avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them. If doubtful 
about a steak, boldly cut it in half. If necessary to replace 
both halves on grill, sear cuts and allot extra time. For roasts, insert 
meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone. Also make 
sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals.

<Don't> practice a new recipe on guests. Have a test-run 
on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning are right.

<Do> buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it. Keep 
it no longer than 36 hours before cooking, and keep it in the coldest 
(but non-freezing) compartment of the refrigerator.   <Don't> 
plan meals that are too complicated. Limit yourself to good meat 
and drink, with bread, salad, corn or potatoes as accessories. Keep 
the desserts simple; fruit does nicely.   <Do> whatever kitchen 
work, such as fixing a salad, preparing garlic bread, or making 
a marinade sauce, ahead of time. When you start the outdoor performance, 
you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen. 
(This goes for getting a drink tray ready, and for having a big cooler 
full of ice on hand long before the party begins.) 
<Don't> 
think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the 
world. The simplest grill (pan type) or inexpensive hibachi can make 
you a chef. You need tongs to handle meat; long forks for turning 
potatoes and corn; heavy foil on hand at all times. And lots of hot 
pads!   <Do> keep the grill high enough above the fire so that 
when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames cannot reach the 
meat.   <Don't> forget to have a supply of Melamine plates, 
bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use. Made of the world's 
toughest unbreakable plastic, Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 
400 different patterns and dozens of colors. There is even one 
set that has "barbecue" written on it.   <Do> without fancy 
tablecloths. It's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor 
table. Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns 
for different kinds of barbecues. Oilcloth only costs about 79~c a 
yard for the very best. Tougher than plastic, it wears well. 
<Don't> forget- when you take to the hills or the beach- that 
your cooler, which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your 
terrace or back yard, is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments. 
There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes. 
With them, you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures, 
and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the 
marina or picnic, in A-1 condition.   <Do> use paper napkins; 
lots of them. Except when you prepare "do it yourself" shish 
kebob or a lobster roast. Then you'll want terry cloth towels 
for mopping up.   <Don't> think barbecue cooking is just sometimes, 
or seasonal. It's year-round, and everywhere. In the winter, 
hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace. Even 
use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter, inside. Summertime 
supper, outside, is a natural. You'll find, once your technique 
is perfected, that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic.

<Do> buy all-purpose mugs or cups. Get copper or 
earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot. Be sure to get 
a few more than you need. You will discover you keep the sauce for basting 
meat in one, use six for drinks, serve soup or coffee in another 
half-dozen- and need one more to mix the salad dressing.   <Don't> 
forget the joys of a meal on the road. If you travel over the 
vast U&S&A& you will, no doubt, discover that feeding is an 
expensive business. Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment 
to work. You <can> take it with you **h a picnic bag, a 
grill, 
a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen convenience foods. Eat 
in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings; or just evenings. 
Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas (gasoline companies 
have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to 
tell you where you have barbecue facilities) and- with soft drinks 
cooled from morning loading up, hamburger, buns, an array of relishes, 
and fresh fruit- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant, 
and 100% more fun. You need a little stove, a coffee pot and a stew 
pot; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials like salt, pepper, plates, 
forks, knives and a can opener. As you pull out of your motel or 
national park home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what you 
need for the next meal. For 25~c load up the cooler with ice and 
keep cool pop in the car. 

#SIMPLE MEAT DISHES#

SPICE is a fact of 
life in the U&S&A&. You only have to think of franks and sausages 
to know what I mean. Go a step further and list all the wonderful 
barbecue basics- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst, 
bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, Bologna, pepperoni, blutwurst- and 
you have a long list of easy specialties. Threaded on a skewer with 
new boiled potatoes, a bit of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom- 
any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a feast.

Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite. A 
story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St& Louis, around 
1883 served his sausages (grilled) and mustard to his fancy customers. 
So that his customers should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued 
white gloves. Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the 
customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise. 
He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks. Years later, 
franks-in-buns were accepted as the "first to go" at the New 
York Polo Grounds.   The nations's number one picnic treat 
is the skinless frankfurter- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or, 
more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill. Either way it's 
hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation. To make the 
picnic frank come close to perfection, remember these tips:

-Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of 
the way through. This permits the juices to permeate the meat during 
cooking.   -Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank 
as are buns. Bring along the conventional ones- catsup, pickle relish, 
mustard, mayonnaise- plus a few extras, such as tangy barbecue 
sauce, chive cream cheese, or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.

-Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns, 
too. Watch closely while browning them, as it doesn't take long.

-An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks 
in French dressing or a mixture of honey, lemon juice and brown sugar 
prior to the picnic. Broil or toast as usual.   Contrary to 
popular opinion, "a la mode" doesn't mean "with ice cream"- 
it just means, in the latest style. Here are a couple of the latest, 
highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard! 
You'll 
have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering! 

_JIFFY BARBECUES_ {1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon 
barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped, 
spiced ham 6 sandwich buns, heated}   Combine first 4 ingredients 
in saucepan; heat thoroughly. Add ham; heat. Serve on buns. 
Makes 6 barbecues. _HOT HIBACHI FRANKS_ You'll never hear "sayonara", 
the Japanese word for goodbye, from your guests when you 
give a hibachi party. The fun of toasting their own sausages over the 
small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces 
will 
keep your group busy- try it and see! _CANNED COCKTAIL FRANKFURTERS_ 

_SWEET-SOUR SAUCE_ {1 large onion, chopped fine 2 tablespoons 
salad oil 1 8-oz& can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice 
1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce} _PINEAPPLE CHUNKS_ _MUSTARD 
CREAM_ {2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1/2 cup heavy 
cream, whipped Salt Paprika}   Spear canned cocktail franks 
with picks. Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl.

Make sauces ahead. Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second 
hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing 
coal stage. Mustard cream, used as alternate dip for franks and 
pineapple tidbits, tastes best when served at room temperature. 
For sweet-sour sauce, cook onion in oil until soft. Add remaining ingredients 
and bring to a boil. Simmer about 10 minutes, and keep warm 
for serving.   To prepare mustard cream, blend mustard with enough 
water to make a thin paste. Fold into whipped cream and add a dash 
of salt and sprinkling of paprika. _TRIM-YOUR-OWN-FRANKS_ A back-yard 
picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter 
trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer. Be sure to 
have plenty of frankfurters and buns on hand. Some tasty frank toppings 
are chili con carne, Coney Island sauce and savory sauerkraut. Serve 
the chili and kraut hot with the franks.   Here are suggestions 
for the frankfurter trimmings: _1._ Chili con carne: use 
canned chili con carne. _2._ Coney Island sauce: finely chop 
several onions and add enough catsup to moisten well; add prepared 
mustard to suit taste. _3._ Savory sauerkraut: add several tablespoons 
of brown sugar to a can of sauerkraut. Add a few caraway seeds, 
too, if you'd like. _BARBECUED FRANKFURTERS_ {1/2 cup minced 
celery 1/4 cup minced onion 1/2 cup tomato ketchup 1/2 cup water 1/4 
cup vinegar 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1/2 teaspoon salt 8 frankfurters}

Combine first 9 ingredients in skillet. Simmer 15 minutes. Prick 
frankfurters with fork; place in sauce. Cover; simmer 15 minutes, 
stirring occasionally, until sauce is of desired consistency. Serve 
in frankfurter buns or as a meat dish. Makes 8 sandwiches or 4 
servings. _PRETEND HAM_ Make criss-cross gashes on one side of skinless 
frankfurters. Stick 4 or 5 cloves in each frank, ham fashion. 
Make a paste of brown sugar and mustard and spread lightly over scored 
surface. If desired, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon drained crushed pineapple. 
Place on rectangle of foil and pinch edges together tightly. Roast 
on grill over coals 15-20 minutes. _FRANKFURTER TWISTS_ Blend 
2 cups biscuit mix with 2/3 cup milk to make a soft dough. Knead on 
lightly floured board and roll out to form a **f-inch rectangle. Spread 
dough with a mixture of 3 tablespoons chili sauce, 1 teaspoon horse-radish 
and 2 teaspoons mustard. Cut dough carefully into 12 strips, 
about 3/4 inch by a foot long. Twist one strip diagonally around each 
skinless frankfurter, pinching dough at ends to seal it. Brush frankfurter

_NOTE:_ Directions are written for those who have had previous 
experience in making pottery. Instructions for preparing clay, drying, 
glazing and firing are not given. 

#EQUIPMENT:#

Basic pottery 
studio equipment. Wooden butter molds and cookie presses. 

#MATERIALS:# 

Ceramic modeling clay: red, white or buff. Stoneware clay 
for tiles. Glazes, one-stroke ceramic colors, stains, cones as indicated 
in the individual instructions. 

#GENERAL DIRECTIONS:#

Use 
well-wedged clay, 
free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without 
cracking. Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly; they must be 
free of oil, wax and dust. _PRESSING DESIGNS:_ The size of wooden 
mold will determine the amount of clay needed. Roll clay to thickness 
indicated in individual instructions. Whenever possible, use the 
wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay. When mold has more than one 
design cavity, make individual paper patterns. Place mold or paper 
pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position 
(cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for 
defects; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes 
and colors). Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity 
design side of wooden mold. To obtain clear impression of mold, press 
clay gently but firmly into mold cavity, starting at center and working 
to outer edges. Trim excess clay away from outer edges. Check thickness 
of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little 
water and adding small pieces of clay. Be sure to press the additional 
clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles. Allow 
project to stand for about five minutes (if wooden press mold is a good 
antique, do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold 
to crack).   To release clay from mold, place hands in a cupped 
position around project; gently lift the edge on far side, then continue 
to release edge completely around mold. Slight tapping on the 
underside of mold will help release the clay, but too much agitation will 
cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay 
from mold. Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on 
clay and reverse bat, clay and mold in one action. This will prevent 
the clay from twisting or bending, causing warping when fired. Place 
project on table and carefully lift the mold off. Study surface of clay 
for defects or desired corrections. If clay is slightly out of shape, 
square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against 
opposite sides, or smooth round pieces with damp fingers. if the background 
of design is too smooth, or you wish to create a wood-grained effect, 
it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle 
of a fine paintbrush. Make slight, smooth grooves rather than cuts 
for the texture (cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating 
pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing). Leave the clay on 
plaster board to dry slowly, covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic 
or cloth to prevent warping. 

#RECTANGULAR TILES#

(opposite page, 
right top): Stoneware clay was used. Clay was rolled to 1/4'' 
thickness. Back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping 
surface. No bisque firing. glazed with two coats of Creek-Turn white 
stoneware glaze (no glaze on sides or bottom). Decorated on unfired 
glaze with one coat of one-stroke ceramic colors; raised details of 
designs were colored in shades of yellow-green, blue-green, brown and 
pink. Tiles were fired once to cone 05. 

#ROUND PLAQUE#

(opposite 
page, bottom): White clay was used, rolled to 1/4'' thickness. 
Bisque fired to cone 05. Stained with Jacquelyn's ceramic unfired 
stain, polished, following manufacturer's directions. Opaque cantaloupe 
and transparent wood brown were used. No further firing. 

#PAPERWEIGHT# 
(opposite page, top left): Red clay was used, rolled 
1/2'' 
thick. Mold was used as pattern and clay cut by holding knife 
at about 45` angle, to form an undercut, making base smaller than the 
pattern top. While clay is still pressed in mold, press three equally 
spaced holes 1/4'' deep, using pencil eraser, in bottom of clay 
to allow for proper drying and firing. Paperweight may be personalized 
on back while clay is leather hard. Bisque fired to cone 05. Unglazed. 

#JARS WITH LIDS# 
(opposite page, top left): Remove wooden 
design head from bowl of butter mold. Fill small hole in bowl with clay. 
Make paper patterns for sections of jar and lid (see Fig& 1, 
opposite page). Measurements 
for rectangular pattern piece ~A are obtained 
by measuring inside circumference and depth of butter mold bowl. 
Pattern for circular base piece ~B is diameter of ~A. Use wooden 
design head of mold for pattern ~C; pattern ~D for lid fits 
over top diameter of ~A. Pattern for inner lid piece ~E fits 
inside ~A. Jars are assembled in bowl of butter mold.   Use 
white or buff clay, rolled to 3/16'' thickness. Place patterns 
on rolled clay and cut around them with knife in vertical position. Place 
clay pieces on wall board.   To assemble jar, put paper pattern 
~B for base in bottom of mold and clay disk ~B on top. Line 
sides of mold with paper pattern ~A. Bevel and score ends of clay 
piece ~A so that they overlap about 1/2'' and make even thickness. 
Place clay piece ~A inside; use slip to join overlapped ends 
together. Join ~B to bottom of ~A, scoring and reinforcing with 
clay coil. Trim excess clay from around lip of mold and set aside 
while assembling lid.   To assemble lid, press clay piece ~C 
in cavity of wooden design head. Press clay into mold as instructed 
in General Directions. Score plain side of ~C and leave in mold. 
Score one side of disk ~D, join to ~C; score other side of ~D 
and one side of disk ~E and join as before. While assembled lid 
is still on design head, gently but firmly press it on plaster board. 
If design head has a 
deep cavity, clay lid will be quite thick at this 
point; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' deep into deep clay 
to allow vent for proper drying and firing. Check fit of lid on jar; 
if inner lid is too big, trim to fit, allowing room for thickness 
of glaze. Remove lid from head of mold. Remove jar from mold. Place 
jar on plaster board with lid in place to dry slowly. Bisque fire to 
cone 08 with lid on jar.   For an antique effect on jars, brush 
Creek-Turn brown toner on bisque ware and sponge it off. Glaze with 
two coats of clear or transparent matt glaze. The large jar was brushed 
with Creek-Turn green toner and sponged off. Glaze with two coats 
of matt glazes in turquoise with touches of blossom pink on lid. When 
dry they were fired to cone 06-05. 

#LITTLE FOLKS SET:#

(Made 
from modern wooden molds **f.) 
Roll white clay to 3/16'' thickness. 

_SALT AND PEPPER:_ Use mold to cut four side pieces. For 
top and bottom pieces, use short end of mold as measurement guide. Press 
the side pieces of clay into cavity of mold. Trim excess clay from 
rim 
of mold. Cut beveled edge on the long sides of clay at a 45` angle 
to miter corners. Score beveled edges and remove pieces from mold; 
place design-side up on plaster board. Make all four sides. Cut clay 
top and base pieces; place on plaster board. Allow all pieces to 
become leather hard before constructing shaker. _TO ASSEMBLE:_ 
Construct sides, bottom and top as for box, using slip on scored edges 
and coils of clay to reinforce seams. Join the four sides together 
first, then add the base; add top last. Use water on finger to smooth 
seams and edges. Turn shaker upside down. Recess base slightly to 
allow room for stopper. Cut hole in base for cork stopper. Add holes 
in top, forming "~S" for salt and "~P" for pepper. Set 
aside to dry thoroughly. _SUGAR AND CREAMER:_ Cut a strip of 
clay for sides long enough and wide enough for three impressions of mold 
design. Press clay into cavity of one mold three times; bevel overlapping 
ends for splice joint, score beveled edges. Form clay strip 
into a cylinder; use slip to join scored ends. Place cylinder on 
a disk of clay slightly larger than cylinder. Score bottom edge of cylinder 
and join to disk with slip. Trim away excess clay; reinforce 
seam with a coil of clay. This will form the sugar bowl. Make creamer 
the same.   Handle for creamer is a strip of clay 1/2'' wide 
and 3-1/2'' long. To add handle, place a wooden dowel against 
the inside wall of creamer. Score outside of container where handle 
ends will be joined. Bend 
handle; press scored handle ends firmly in 
place using dowel to reinforce container while pressing; use slip to 
join. To form spout, between two designs, dampen area slightly and 
gently push clay outward. Make lid for sugar bowl the same as jar lids, 
omitting design disk. Cut a 
notch in lid for spoon handle if desired. 
Set aside to dry with lid on sugar bowl. _VASES:_ Make same 
as salt and pepper shakers, leaving off top pieces. Vases may be made 
into candles by filling with melted wax and a wick. _NAPKIN HOLDER:_ 
Cut a piece of clay for base and two for sides each about **f (long 
enough for three impressions of mold). Press the two sides into 
cavity of one mold three times. Put cut pieces on plaster board to dry 
to firm leather-hard state. Score side edges of base; join sides 
and base with slip and reinforce with coil. A cardboard pattern cut to 
fit inside holder will help to prevent warping. Place pattern inside 
holder; use three strips of clay to hold in place (see Fig& 
2, page 71). Do not use wood as it will not shrink with the clay and 
would cause breakage.   Let all projects dry slowly for several 
days. Clean greenware. Bisque fire to cone 08. Inside of pieces 
was glazed with three coats of Creek-Turn bottle green antique glaze. 
Outside was finished with Creek-Turn brown toner brushed on and sponged 
off to give antique finish. Fired to cone 06-05. 

#CHANGING COLORS#


_TO CHANGE FROM ONE COLOR YARN TO ANOTHER:_ 
When changing from one color to another, whether working on right or 
wrong side, pick up the new strand from underneath dropped strand. Photograph 
shows the wrong side of work with light strand being picked 
up under dark strand in position to be purled. _TO MEASURE WORK:_ 
Spread article on flat surface to required width before measuring 
length at center. 

#MEASURING ARMHOLE#


_TO MEASURE ARMHOLE:_ 
Mark row on which first stitches 
have been bound off for armhole by drawing 
a contrasting colored thread through it. Place work on a flat surface 
and smooth out. Measure straight up from marked row. See illustration. 

_TO INSERT MARKERS:_ When directions read "~sl a 
marker on needle", put a small safety pin, paper clip, or commercial 
ring marker on needle. In working, always slip marker from one needle 
to another. To mark a row or stitch, tie contrasting thread around 
end 
of row or stitch to be marked. 

#BACKSTITCHING SEAM#


_TO SEW SEAMS 
WITH BACKSTITCH:_ Most seams are sewn with backstitch, especially 
on curved, slanted or loose edges. Pin right sides of pieces together, 
keeping edges even and matching rows or patterns. Thread matching 
yarn in tapestry needle. Run end of yarn through several stitches 
along edge to secure; backstitch pieces together close to edge. Do 
not draw yarn too tight. See illustration. _TO SEW IN SLEEVES:_ 
Place sleeve seam at center underarm and center of sleeve cap at shoulder 
seam. Ease in any extra fullness evenly around. Backstitch seam. 

#WEAVING SEAM#


_TO WEAVE SEAMS TOGETHER:_ Straight vertical 
edges, such as those at the back seam of a sock, can be woven together 
invisibly. Thread matching yarn in tapestry needle. Hold edges 
together, right side up.

HOTEI is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch 
a family boat. Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the 
helmsman has a clear view. Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves 
safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for 
three, galley and marine toilet. The gals can sun themselves in the 
roomy aft cockpit. All are well distributed, not crowded together near 
the stern. And with passenger weight shifted forward, Hotei levels 
off for speed under power of a Merc 800. The 80-~hp motor drives 
her at 25 ~mph with six aboard!   With only two aboard, Hotei 
does better than 27 
~mph- and she gives a comfortable ride at this 
speed even in a three-foot chop. She also banks into a turn like 
a fine runabout- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all 
over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser. Nor is she a wet boat. 
We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.

{A lot of 
thought} went into storage space construction. There's a large compartment 
in the forward cockpit for charts and other items. The cabin 
has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for 
water skiis, life jackets, etc&. 
The aft cockpit has a **f storage bin 
over six feet long that doubles as a seat. On each side of the motor 
well there's storage for battery, bumpers, line and spare props with 
six-gallon gas tanks below. The well itself is designed to take two 
Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon 
long-cruise gas tank below it.   Needless to say, you can't 
build Hotei in a couple of weeks. Our building time was slightly 
over 400 hours- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom, 
sink, head and hardware was under $800. A comparable manufactured 
boat would cost close to $3,000. Consider what you have to earn to be 
able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it. A 
Gator trailer, Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways. 
This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save 
you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.   All framing 
in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which, in the dressed state you 
buy it, is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings. Therefore, 
the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens, 
etc&, on a table saw. Besides flathead bronze screws, silicon bronze 
Stronghold nails (made by Independent Nail + Packing Co&, 
Bridgewater, Mass&) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood 
resorcinal glue is used in all the joints.   {Construction} 
follows a thorough study of the drawings. Start by laying out the six 
frames and the transom on a level floor. Draw each outline in a different-color 
chalk, one on top of the other. In this way you will be 
able to detect any obvious mistakes.   The transom frame is made 
first with the joints lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No& 
12 Stronghold nails. After notching it for the keelson, chines and 
battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue 
and the same type 
nails. All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets 
are glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again using the one-inch, 
No& 12 nails. The frames are notched only for the keelson 
and the chines. If notched for the battens, they would require more work, 
be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge 
water could flow through. Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in 
contact with the plywood planking.   The jig is erected after the 
frames and transom are complete. This is an important step because 
any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull 
as you advance in construction. Be sure all members are parallel, 
vertical and level as required.   After the frames and transom 
are set up on the jig and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide 
mahogany (only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness 
is used throughout) is butted between frames one and two below the line 
of the keelson. The frames are glued and screwed to this piece. The 
joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated 
Fiberglas cloth and nailed. It is over this piece that the 
laminated stem and keelson are spliced.   The keelson, made of 
two three-inch widths, is next installed. The first piece is glued 
and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames 
one and two. The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the 
first. Note, however, that it is six inches shorter at the forward end. 
One-inch, No& 10 screws are used in both cases.   {A stem 
jig} is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to 
frame one. The stem is laminated from four pieces. Take two three-inch-wide 
pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make 
the four. Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and 
bend them into place on the jig. The first two pieces butt against 
the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace 
between the first two frames. The second two pieces lap over the inner 
member of the keelson and butt against the outer member. They're 
glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson. A number of ~C 
clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.

All bottom battens are two inches wide. The side ones are a half-inch 
narrower. The battens are carefully fastened in place after some 
necessary fairing on all frames. Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No& 10 screws 
are used. Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks and 
front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens. 
With the exception of two battens, all run to the stem where they 
are glued and screwed after careful beveling. The chines go in the same 
way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength 
and easier bending.   Fairing is always a tedious job but 
the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple 
jig. I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer 
with a pair of Sure Grips. The aluminum, flush against the battens, 
acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson 
to the proper bevels easily. If you don't own a planer and don't 
want to buy one, it's well worth renting.   {The planking} 
is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood. This 
can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long. The 42-inch width 
leaves very little waste. Four pieces are used. Plank the sides first, 
using glue and one-inch, No& 12 Stronghold nails at all battens, 
the stem and the transom. Another person inside with a weight against 
each batten will help in the fastening. The best procedure is to 
have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off. 
Then trim the excess. I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter 
Cable for this job. It's good for cutting all the planking because 
it cuts with a bit-like blade at high ~rpm and does not chatter 
the plywood like a saber saw.   When cut, the planking is clamped 
in place for a final and careful trimming. Then it is marked on the 
inside where it comes in contact with the transom, frames, keelson and 
all the battens. It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings. The 
next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at 
the contact points. Then it is replaced and fastened. The bottom planking 
is applied in the same manner.   After planking, the bottom 
gets a layer of Fiberglas. The spray rails are first glued on the 
outside and fastened from the inside with screws. Then the chines are 
rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation. Since the 
sides are also covered up to the spray rails, they are also rough-sanded 
in that area. The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at 
a time. A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line 
by about three inches. Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size. 
Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin. When the resin 
has hardened, mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish. 
I used bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding 
the hardener. Using a cheap brush, coat one side of the bottom with 
the resin and then apply the cloth. When the cloth is smooth, apply 
another coat of resin, spreading it with a paint roller. Be sure it is 
well saturated and then allow it to harden.   When the whole bottom 
has hardened, use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth 
at the keel line and near the spray rail. Then lay a three-inch-wide 
strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of 
the stem. Before the resin has hardened, screw a one-inch mahogany keel 
strip along the centerline. This protects the bottom in beaching. 
Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co&, 
1605 W& Elizabeth ave&, Linden, N& J&. They will also 
supply literature on application.   {The hull} is now turned 
over (with the help of about seven friends) and placed in a level, well-braced 
position. I set it on the Gator trailer. I laid three layers 
of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing a bow eye 
at this time. For added strength, I also fastened a small block on 
each side of every frame and batten joint. Again, these blocks were 
set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.   After trimming 
off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them 
to the jig at a working height, the top of the side planking is installed. 
This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom. 
These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry. When they're 
on, the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.   The 
sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from 
frame six to the transom, forming a real strong transom brace. Note 
another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between 
these pieces.   The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine 
plywood. All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior 
fir plywood. Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring. 
The exception is where the flooring butts. These battens are glued 
and screwed to the frames.   With all deck battens in place, the 
bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line. Use one coat of 
Firzite and one coat of marine paint. Bottoms of the floorboards are 
also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place.   After 
the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed. They're followed 
by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated. The windshield glass 
is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin.   {Inside}, 
bunks are framed up and installed as indicated. A head is a handy 
thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the 
port bunk. The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into 
the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above 
the sink. For padding the seats and bunks, I used Ensolite, Type 
~M. 
Lightweight, non-absorbent, fire resistant and dimensionally stable, 
it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement. Available 
in **f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot. 
<You can build this vacation cottage yourself. It is a full scale, 
small, 
but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete 
in every detail. Because of the unique design by the architect Egils 
Hermanovski, you can build most of it in your own home workshop 
in your spare time. Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials, 
and requires the use of only simple tools. On the following 
pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to 
your vacation cottage, from choosing the proper site to applying the 
final trim>.

In recognition of the growing trend for second homes, 
or vacation cottages, we have designed this one specifically with 
the family handyman in mind. It is a big project, not to be taken lightly. 
But each step has been broken down into easy stages, utilizing 
standard materials and simple tools, well within the capabilities of the 
handyman. 

#THE THEORY#

The idea behind our design is modular units, 
or panelization. Everything possible has been scaled to standard 
sizes and measurements of materials. Wall panels and structural timbers 
are standard as are windows and doors, making for a minimum of cutting. 
We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so 
that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop, 
panel by panel, according to plan. Thus, when you have prepared your 
foundation and laid the floor, these can be trucked to the site and erected 
with a small crew of friends in a weekend. The roof timbers are 
precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed 
in a matter of three or four days. Then you can do the finishing 
touches at your leisure. 

#A WARNING#

Due to the fact that building 
codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country, the first 
thing to do is to find out what, if any, they are. Close to a large 
city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote 
section there might be no restrictions at all. This can usually 
be found out at the nearest town hall. At the same time check the electrical, 
plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as well as possible zoning 
regulations. Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available 
or not, check the local customs in the use of bottled or ~L-P 
gas (we give you alternatives later on). Be sure that this information 
is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion. If there 
are any major restrictions, they usually can be obtained in printed 
form. Where a building permit is required, find out what you must 
present when applying for one. In many cases, you must file a complete 
set of plans with the local building inspector. These will be available 
at cost from our Plans Department. 

#THE SITE#

Some general 
things to look for in a site, if you haven't already bought one, are 
accessibility, water drainage, and orientation. How are the roads, 
and how will they stand up? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property; 
swampy areas or intermittent springs? A visit in the early 
spring after a thaw will be very informative. Note where the sun rises 
and sets, and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms 
come from. Will the view be something you can live with? Don't 
worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative 
foundations later on. 

#THE MATERIALS#

With this first issue 
we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic (~A 
version) and the expandable (~B version). This will be <for the 
shell of the house only> (roof, walls, and floor), and does not include 
the carport or balcony. This will permit you to get a <rough> 
estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost. Bear in mind 
that this does <not> include interior panels for partitions, fancy 
flooring, appliances and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing, 
all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.   The 
wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard **f and **f of 
a good grade, free from structural faults. They should be as straight 
as possible, as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when 
the walls are erected. The outside surface of the solid units shall 
be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood, plastic coated 
panel board, high density particle board, asbestos-cement board, or 
any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building 
supply dealer. The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof, and 
the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired. All panel 
board comes in standard **f foot size. It is recommended that panels 
be both glued as well as nailed to the frame. The fixed window panels 
with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass 
set in a mastic glazing compound. The louvers are constructed as 
shown in the detail, with a drop door for ventilation. There are standard 
sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels 
requiring them. The door panels are designed to accommodate standard 
doors which should be of exterior grade. The filler panels for the gable 
ends are cut from full **f sheets as shown, leaving no wastage. The 
battens covering the joints are of **f stock and are applied after 
the walls are erected. All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is 
highly recommended. Note: If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside 
and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other, and 1/8-inch glass 
is used, stock lumber in **f, **f, and **f can be used in making the 
glass panels. Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special 
size lumber for the glass trim. In any case, there is no special milling 
or rabbeting required for the panels.

With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting 
tools, fixtures, and attachments available, the drill press has become 
a basic home workshop tool. The drill press consists of a vertical 
shaft (spindle) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a 
drill chuck, a tubular housing (quill) in which the spindle is mounted, 
a head in which the quill is mounted, a feed lever which moves the 
quill up or down, a power source, and a movable table upon which the work 
is placed. There is often a means of locking the quill and, on larger 
presses, the table can be tilted.   The size of the press is 
usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity (the maximum diameter tool 
shank it will hold) or distance between the spindle center and the 
column. A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center 
of a 22 inch board or circle.   A new radial drill press with 
a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done 
at any angle. The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on 
the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work. 

#SET-UP AND MAINTENANCE#

The drill press should be leveled and, depending 
on whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely to a 
sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws. 
This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.   A coat 
of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the 
polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth 
will discourage rusting of the column and quill. Presses not fitted 
with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in 
the lubrication holes in the quill. The rest of the press should be kept 
clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.   Be careful to 
keep the drive belt free of oil and grease. Belt tension is adjusted 
by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount. Keep 
the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by 
hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle 
bearings. Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises 
the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds 
the quill in the raised position. The return spring tension may be 
adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing 
with a pair of pliers (to prevent the spring from unwinding when it 
is released), loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing 
until the desired tension is achieved. Turning the housing clockwise 
will reduce tension, counter-clockwise will increase it. 

#DON'T 
LOSE THE CHUCK KEY#

Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide 
a socket for the chuck key; otherwise, you'll have to spend 
a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the 
press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the 
bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not 
in use. 

#FEEDS AND SPEEDS#

Drill speeds are important if you want 
a good job. Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed, 
depending on the material worked. On most drill presses, it is impossible 
to get the exact speed, but you can come close by adjusting the 
drive belt on the step-cone pulleys. You will find a chart giving the 
various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere 
in the instruction booklet that came with the tool. See the table 
on page 34 for exact recommended speeds. Generally, the larger the 
tool and the harder the material, the slower the speed.   Feed pressure 
is also of major importance. Too much pressure will force the 
tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed 
or broken tools. Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other hard 
material, causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting 
edge. The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed 
with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even 
rate. 

#COMMON DRILLING TOOLS#

There are numerous types and styles 
of tools to drill holes. The most common are the twist drill, the 
solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the double spur 
bit, and the power wood bit. All will do a good job if sharp, but the 
twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others, since they 
do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual 
boring starts.   The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting 
large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by 
reversing the cutter blade. Since fly cutters are one sided and not 
balanced, they should be used at the slowest speed available, and fed 
very slowly to avoid binding. Fly cutters can fool you into putting 
your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to avoid nicked fingers, 
keep your hands well out of the way. 

#SIMPLE HOLE DRILLING OPERATIONS# 

When drilling all the way through a workpiece, always place a 
piece of scrap wood underneath. This will not only protect the work 
table, but also assure a clean breakthrough. Another method of assuring 
a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through, 
then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn the piece over, 
and finish from the other side. In soft woods with pronounced grain, 
there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying 
hardness of the wood. In this case, drilling a small pilot hole or 
clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.   When a hole 
is to be bored to a predetermined depth, mark the depth on the side 
of the stock, then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark. 
The depth gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored to 
exact and identical depth.

The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts 
are of unusual interest in many respects. For their length, their 
types of construction, their picturesque settings, and their literary 
associations, they should be known and remembered. In this sequence 
I shall write about them in the order of their erection.   The 
first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part,- and perhaps 
the most interesting one, connected Newbury (now Newburyport) with 
Salisbury Point. Its building was first proposed in 1791, when a 
group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned the General Court 
for an act of incorporation. This document began: _"NO& 
1 NEWBURY PORT, MAY 30TH, 1791_   "Whereas, a Bridge over 
Merrimack River, from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf, 
Esquire, in Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury, 
would be of very extensive utility, by affording a safe Conveyance 
to Carriages, Teams 
and Travellers at all seasons of the year, 
and at all Times of Tide.   "We, the Subscribers, do agree, 
that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to 
this, or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to the Hon'ble 
General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, praying 
for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such 
Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge, and a Right to demand 
a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms, 
and if such an Act shall be obtained, then we severally agree each 
with the others, that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares 
set against our respective Names, the whole into two hundred shares 
being divided, and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times 
and in such Manners, as by the said proposed Corporation, shall 
be directed and required".   This paper was signed by forty-five 
persons, subscribing a total of two hundred shares.   A month 
later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that 
the bridge was to be built. The matter was considered and reconsidered, 
and finally opposed, but in spite of many objections, the Court 
granted a charter on January 9, 1792. On November 26 of that year the 
bridge was completed and opened.   Timothy Palmer, who invented 
and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges, 
was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex, 
or "Deer Island" bridge although the actual work was carried 
out under the direction of William Coombs, who received @ 300 as 
recompense.

This two-part bridge is best described by Rev& Timothy 
Dwight, president of Yale College, in his "Travels in New-England 
and New-York", published in New Haven in 1821. He says 
of it:   "It consists of two divisions, separated by an island 
at a small distance from the southern shore. The division between 
the island and this shore, consists principally of an arch; whose 
chord is one hundred and sixty feet, and whose vortex is forty feet (it 
was actually 37 feet) above the high-water mark. In appearance and 
construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge. The whole length of 
Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four. 
I have already mentioned that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport 
was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country. As Mr& 
Palmer was educated to house-building only, and had never seen a 
structure of this nature; he certainly deserves not a little credit 
for the invention".   It is hardly necessary to remind students 
of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby 
Rowley; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was 
sixteen years old; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect, 
Moody Spofford. It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man 
who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the 
principle of the arch, which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth, 
Haverhill, and Philadelphia.   The Essex Merrimack Bridge 
when first built was not covered. As far as we know, no American 
bridge had been thus protected in 1792. Richard S& Allen is the 
authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed 
by 1810. Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published 
in the "Massachusetts Magazine" in May 1793, which is reproduced 
herewith (Fig& 1). A brief description accompanying the picture 
says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber. Between 
the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island 
there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet; between the north 
shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 
113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.   A 
dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place 
July 4, 1793, in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island. 
It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the 
first share-holders, stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the 
occasion. The "Essex Journal" says that he "delivered an oration 
on the bridge, which for elegance of style, propriety of speech 
or force of argument, was truly Ciceronian". The reporter must have 
written this with tongue in cheek, because Dexter's oration could 
hardly be understood; and, although he later explained that he was 
talking French, it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to 
the joys of the evening.   The north portion of the Essex bridge 
was well worth the cost of construction, although it proved to be twice 
what was estimated in the beginning. It stood in its original form 
until 1882. The southern half, however, on account of its underbracing, 
was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation. In 1810 it 
was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge. This was built 
by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette 
County, Pennsylvania. Timothy Palmer had general supervision 
of the work.   An advertisement in the "Newburyport Herald", 
December 21, 1810, shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain 
bridges. It reads: _"CHAIN BRIDGES_   "Information 
is hereby given that Mr& Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Mass& 
has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the 
Chain Bridge, in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, 
Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to the sale 
of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges.   "Mr& 
Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if 
desired will view the proposed site, and lay out and superintend the 
work, or recommend a suitable person to execute it.   John 
Templeman

"Approved, Timothy Palmer"   This chain bridge proved 
less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end. It fell, 
February 6, 1827, carrying with it a horse and wagon, two men and four 
oxen. The horse and men were saved, but the oxen drowned. In spite 
of this catastrophe, the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened 
again on July 17, 1827. This second chain bridge was 570 feet long, 
had two thirty-foot towers and a draw, and a double roadway.

The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868, when the County 
Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways.

Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous 
use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River 
at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance 
of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site, May 
28th to June 3rd. Colonel Frederick W& Lander, impersonated, 
will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's 
(now College) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel 
Benjamin F& Kelley's (West) Virginia Infantry, then swarming 
through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates. 
He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops- thus the 
old bridge has another distinction; that of being the first such structure 
secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s.   The 
bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements, war, fire, 
and floods, as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic, for more than 
a hundred years. Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction 
by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister. 
It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the 
last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic 
on U&S& Route 250- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike. 
It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving bridge of 
its type to serve a main artery of the U&S& highway system, thus 
it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.   This 
covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action 
in the early morning of June 3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements 
of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part 
and parcel of the war story. So frequently has pictures of the bridge 
appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the 
old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known 
structures in West Virginia.   Completed and opened for traffic 
in 1852, the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth 
and his brother, Eli, of Beverly. The Chenoweth brothers were experienced 
bridge builders, and against the competition of other, and better 
known, bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of 
the covered, wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike 
a dozen years before, as well as many other bridges for several counties. 
The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master piece, 
with its 139-foot, dual lane, span- and it stands today as a monument 
to its builders. Never rebuilt, the bridge was strengtened in 1938 
by two extra piers, a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper 
side in order to care for modern traffic.   During the war it 
was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the 
railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior. Union 
soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the 
rain or other inclement weather, and some of them left momentoes of their 
stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.

But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened 
when Brigadier General William E& (Grumble) Jones reached Philippi 
while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May, 1863. General 
Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings, including the 
long bridge at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses 
and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge, he sent his men 
to work piling combustibles in and around it. Reverend Joshual Corder, 
a Baptist minister, gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies, 
to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure; he 
reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or other Confederate 
commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat. Jones 
relented, he did not order his men to apply the torch- the drove of 
livestock was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the mountains 
to feed and serve the Confederate army, while Jones and his raiders 
turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden. 
Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned 
to destroy it, after filling its two lanes with hay and straw- but 
for what reason is not recorded nor remembered, certainly not because 
of pressure from an opposing Confederate force. On the second occasion 
it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their 
purpose.   Centering around this historic old structure, a group 
of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned 
a week-long series of events, beginning on May 28th and continuing 
through June 3rd, to observe most appropriately the centennial of 
the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.

It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming 
pool- eight enlightening, vigorous, rigorous, not wholly unrewarding 
years. We have learned a lot- a dash of hydrochemistry here, a 
bit about plumbing and pump-priming there. We have had sound grounding 
in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy. 
We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard 
birds. True, our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of 
our neighbors have built their own pools, thereby diluting our spectacular 
attractions. But problems cling to pools, as any pool owner knows. 
So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials, 
errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the 
first time- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience. 

#WHERE TO PUT IT#

Position may not be everything, but in the 
case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties, social and/or 
physical. We speak from varying viewpoints. One of us has a pool set 
in a wooded area very near the house. The other has his pool far away 
from the house in a field high on a hill.   If you are dreaming 
of a blue, shimmering pool right outside your living room windows, 
close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of 
children, damp towels, squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated 
plastic toys. You are likely to be nearer the truth.   You can 
also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living 
quarters, the greater the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying 
noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude. On the 
other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children 
cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the 
pool.   Another dilemma: As picturesque as a sylvan pond in 
the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being 
of a pool. Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating 
lawn every time the grass is mowed.   As in choosing a wife, it 
is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be 
in bad weather as well as in good. In the colder climes, for instance, 
you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when 
your pool will hardly look its best. It may be a big hole in the ground 
filled with salt hay, or an ice floe studded with logs. Even a 
neat, plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold. (We do, 
however, recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk- 
flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the 
pool.)   Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts. 
Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and 
size of your land. But if space and money are no problem and small children 
are not on hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have 
your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs 
of the house. And a good several feet around the pool should be neither 
greensward nor woods, but good hard pavement.   The placement 
of your pool, however, will not of itself solve the two major problems 
of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining 
to safety. Coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself 
as well as of your family, neighbors, friends and anyone you ever 
talked to on a transoceanic jet.   Eight years ago while we were 
going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were 
each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings 
to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid 
out nearby for the lord and master's delectation. But not even our 
first pool-side 
gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies. 
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own 
backyards. Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled. 
Had we taken a lien on a state park? Not at all. We had merely been 
discovered by the pool sharks. We were in business!   From 
proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step- 
no more than the change from city clothes to trunks. Nai^ve of us, 
maybe, but the results of our impulsive invitations to "come over 
next summer and swim in our new pool" were both unexpected and unsettling. 

#OUR BOOK OF ETIQUETTE#

After the first few weeks, it was 
obvious that rules had to be made, laid down and obeyed- even if our 
popularity ratings became subnormal as a result. So rules we made, 
in unabashed collusion. Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided 
precisely, we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single 
social code for pool owners.   First and foremost: No one- 
no, not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations 
to his or her own circle. Just short of forty lashes we finally managed 
to coerce our children to this view. Their friends and ours are 
welcome to share the pool, but on our terms and at our times. 
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning 
beforehand.   No ringers, either- even if they are trailing 
legitimate invitees. We want to know when the Potlatches telephone 
exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that we won't 
end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August.

No young children may come without adults except for a specific, 
organized, chaperoned party. And accompanying adults are urged to 
keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities. A gaggle 
of gabbling mothers, backs to the pool, is no safeguard.   No bottle 
pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come 
to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk 
and run. (Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant took 
a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood 
free-drink stop.)   We designated one day a week as the time 
when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours. This has 
saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less 
brutal to the young "less fortunate" than ours.   We also 
worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours 
early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco 
lunch <en famille>. We gently usher them to an island of tables 
and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where 
they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.   All 
dressing (undressing to be more exact) must be done in our small bath 
house or at the swimmers' homes. (To avoid any possible excuse for 
a dripping parade through your house, it is a good idea to have a telephone 
extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between 
the pool and the parking area.) We do, however, provide a limited 
number of extra suits, mainly for children, and we stock extra towels 
and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences. Life-preservers, the buckle-on 
kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness, too, for the very young. 

#PRESERVING LIFE AND LIMB#

Safety rules, of course, are more 
important than all the others put together.   In many localities, 
now, the law requires all pools to be fenced, usually to a minimum 
height of 5 feet. But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place 
for running or horseplay. We allow no underwater endurance contests, 
either, or inexpert versions of water polo.   Diving boards must 
have non-skid surfaces (coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine 
and rots quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent). And 
divers must be enjoined to look before they leap, either on top of 
someone else or onto a pool edge.   Our pools also have wide, shallow 
steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus 
be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.

All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool 
and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.

When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend- for your 
own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent. You 
should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty 
pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.

Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen. They are the 
result of a constant and careful contest with the elements. Unless 
you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your 
leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and 
feeding- from ~pH content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left 
to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service. Of course, if your 
pool is close to the house, your wife can always add it to her housekeeping 
chores (you hope). Or you can make pool care the price of swimming 
for teen-agers. Even so, every pool owner, in case of emergency, 
should have some idea of what makes things work. A brief course in 
hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future 
crisis. 

#PRESERVING THE POOL#

A sudden high rise in temperature 
will turn your pool poison green overnight. You need more chlorine. The 
walls feel slippery. You need algaecide. With or without professional 
help, you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself 
unless you have a full-time pool nurse.   You should see to it 
that the trap, the dirt-catcher in front of the filter, is always clean. 
A pool is no place for a shut trap.   You should firmly insist 
that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water. When shed, 
they leave rust marks.   You can hope against hope that come spring 
cleaning, your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing 
and furbishing. It has happened.   Many hours of spring cleaning 
will be saved, however, if you remove the main drain grate when you 
close the pool season in the fall. As the pool is emptied, stand by 
to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet. Much of 
the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp, but requires dynamite 
if allowed to dry. If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you may 
easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out. Of course, when 
your 6-inch torrent of water is released, it may cause a lot of comment 
as it passes through or by neighboring properties. Do not forget 
this possibility.   If your pool is located on or near sloping 
ground, it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable 
than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping 
out the water and then scooping out all the debris.   It may be 
true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene, but lights also attract 
all the insect life for miles around. Once on the water, these 
little visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming 
problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those 
present. Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light 
you need at much less expense.   Our experience has taught 
us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible, from pipes to 
brushes. 
Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be sure that one 
person (in the family or not) is regularly responsible for each aspect 
of the job, with no chance for claiming, "It wasn't my turn".

Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves- 
even if the little boys do want to play space ship. You may find yourself 
hitting bottom, literally, as you discover that water is running 
out even while you are putting it in.

DRAW a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania. 
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning 
will be <obsolete in 10 years>. Fortunately, it is the ~FHA 
which has arrived at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment 
of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and thus acquired 
with a minimum of financial stress. Even if you live above that line, 
the ~FHA will back you, for they have decided that the inclusion 
of air conditioning in <all> new homes is a good thing and should 
be encouraged.   New simplified packaged units, recently devised 
prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on techniques make 
it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as 
little as $600 to $900. Two men can often do the installation in a 
day. You can install it yourself- this is a central system that will 
cool <every part> of your house. Its upkeep? No less an authority 
than the ~FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes 
possible more than offset its operating costs. _IS IT WORTH-WHILE?_ 
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days 
of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted. We know 
now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually 
desirable, and accurate controls assure the comfort we want. 
We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer cooling. On the 
contrary, there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills. The filtered 
air benefits allergies, asthma, sinus, hay fever. Control of temperature 
and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid. Heart conditions 
and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive 
heat.   Housekeeping is easier. The cleaner air means 
less time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry cleaners, lighter 
loads for the washing machine. The need for reupholstering, redecorating, 
repainting becomes more infrequent. Clothes hold their shape 
better, and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.   It 
will improve your disposition. When you're less fatigued, things 
just naturally look brighter. The children can have their daytime naps 
and hot meals, and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms. 
You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed and free of 
hot weather nerves.   You can forget about screens, and leave the 
storm windows up all year around.   Best of all, central air conditioning 
is something you can afford. Like its long-lived cousin, 
the refrigerator, a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years 
or more. That brings its per-year cost down mighty low. _FOR ANY 
HOUSE._ No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story, Colonial 
or contemporary, central air conditioning is easily installed. The 
equipment won't take up valuable space either. It can go in out-of-the-way 
waste space.   But there's no denying that the easiest 
and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning 
is when you build. If that's done, the house can be designed 
and oriented for best operation, and this can mean savings both in the 
size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.   If you 
can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building, 
by all means <make provision for its easy adding later>. Manufacturers 
have designed equipment for just such circumstances, and your 
savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.   If your 
house is to have a forced warm air system, cooling can be a part of 
it. This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system, 
for your regular heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double 
duty for cooling. You can get year-'round air conditioners in the 
same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or 
low boy, horizontal or counterflow. The units can be installed in basement, 
attic, crawlspace, or in a closet located in the living area. The 
cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet. From the coil 
small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set 
in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.   If you plan to add 
cooling later to your heating system, there are things to watch for. 
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed. 
They may be inaccessible later. <Be sure your ducts and blower are 
big enough to handle cooling>. This is especially important if you 
live in a mild-winter zone. <Be sure you get a perimeter heating system>, 
and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for 
heating.   You can get a hot water system that will also work 
for cooling your house. For cooling, chilled water is circulated instead 
of hot water. Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating 
units, each with its own thermostat. These systems are more expensive 
than year-'round forced air systems. The minimum cost for an average 
one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to run $1500 above 
the cost of the heating alone. _SEPARATE SYSTEMS._ If the problems 
of combining cooling with your heating are knotty, it may be cheaper 
to plan on a completely separate cooling system. The simplest kind 
of separate system uses a single, self-contained unit. It is, in effect, 
an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts 
to distribute the cooled, cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.

In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be installed, 
one serving the living area, the other the sleeping zone. In a two-story 
house, one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first 
floor, another in the attic to cool the second. In each case, having 
separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of 
permitting individual zone control. _THE HEAT PUMP._ One of the 
more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched 
to heating. As you know, a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping 
the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors. A relatively 
simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine 
literally runs backward, and the heat is extracted from outdoor air 
and turned indoors.   Up until recently, this heat pump method 
of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when 
outside temperatures were above 40 degrees. Now, the machine has been 
improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat 
at temperatures down to 15 degrees. You can get this added heating 
feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.

Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost, for those 
emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard holds up fuel delivery, 
or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start 
up your whole heating plant. _WHAT SIZE CONDITIONER?_ How large 
a cooling unit you need, and the method of its installation, depends 
on a variety of factors. Among other things, besides the nature of 
your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from 
the outside, it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup 
of your family. Families with children usually don't want the house 
quite so cool. If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity. 
The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can easily double 
your cooling load.   Cooling requirements are best expressed in 
terms of ~BTU's. A ~BTU is a unit of heat, and the ~BTU 
rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can 
pump <out> of your house in an hour. A very rough rule of thumb is 
that, under favorable conditions, you'll need 15 ~BTU's of cooling 
for every square foot of your house. This is if outdoor temperatures 
have a high average of 95 degrees. You'll need more if the high 
average is above that, less if it's below.   Coolers are also 
rated by tons. A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by 
melting a ton of ice. By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will 
provide 12,000 ~BTU of cooling in one hour.   You may find 
a conditioner rated by horsepower. It is generally an inaccurate 
method of rating, for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor, 
and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll 
get. A 1-~hp conditioner, for example, may vary in effectiveness 
from under 8,000 ~BTU to well over 10,000 ~BTU.   The 
safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit 
you need, rather than trying to do this yourself.   Don't urge 
your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be 
sure you have enough. Better to have your equipment slightly undersized 
than too big. Here's why:   Reducing humidity is often 
as important as cooling. An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly, 
then shut down for a long period. Before it cycles on again, humidity 
can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature 
is still low. With a unit of the right size, a compressor will 
run continuously during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as it 
does temperature. _MONEY-SAVING TIPS._ Attention to details can 
cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately. 
A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled 
and heated for as little as $128 a year, or $11 a month. 
If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily, your unit 
will have less heat to remove. Keep the direct sun from reaching the 
house and you've won the first battle. In a new house, generous roof 
overhangs are a logical and effective solution. If the house you plan 
to buy or build won't have big overhangs, you can still do a fair 
job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed 
trellises, fences and awnings.   Shade trees, too, are a big help, 
so keep them if you can. Drawn blinds and draperies do some good, 
but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.

The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof, the greater 
its heat impact. The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence 
how much cooling you're going to need. A shift in the walls, 
or a change in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely, can 
save you money.   You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the 
sun, double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation. <Restrict 
large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house>. 
They're easier to shade there. An attic space above insulation makes 
a house easier to cool. You'll even gain by putting your water 
heater outside the conditioned space, and using an electric range instead 
of a gas one. Gas adds to the moisture load.   Insulate, weatherstrip, 
double-glaze to the maximum. In insulation, the numbers to 
remember are 6-4-2. They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation 
in the ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the floors. 
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling 
installation, but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in 
heating and cooling. A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 
per cent.   It costs two to three times as much to remove a ~BTU 
in summer as it does to add one in winter, so every solitary ~BTU 
is worth attention. You'll foil them in droves, along with 
their pal humidity, by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a 
bathroom ventilator for when you shower, and an outside vent for the 
clothes drier. _KEEPING CONDITIONERS QUIET._ It's no use pretending 
that all conditioners are quiet, but the noise they produce can 
be kept to a minimum. Good workmanship is important in the installation, 
so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award the job on 
the basis of price alone.   Avoid attic placement directly above 
a bedroom.

MOST RECREATION WORK calls for a good deal of pre-planning. 
This is particularly true in site selection. You must know before 
you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you 
must have a list of requirements on where, how many, and what type sites 
are needed. With such a program you can make constructive selections 
of the best sites available.   Begin the examination of a site 
with a good map and aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more 
and more available through the work of counties and other government 
agencies. The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal 
government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural 
features of the site. These are inexpensive and available from the U& 
S& Geological Society, Washington 25, D& C&. In recent 
years many counties and the U& S& Forest Service have taken 
aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning 
use. Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer 
showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office 
showing ownerships of land.   Inspect the site in the field during 
the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for 
recreation. This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the 
climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the water interests, 
etcetera, which vary greatly with the seasons. It is usually helpful 
to make a sketch map in the field, showing the size and location 
of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site. These 
are a great aid for planning use back at the office. ##

FOR 
SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified and experienced 
park planner to carry through the study. However, there is also much 
to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are 
available and interested in recreation. County judges, commissioners, 
engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a 
long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions 
to offer from their varied professional experiences. A visit to the site 
by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify 
opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.

How much study is required? This, of course, depends on 
the character of the site itself, the previous experience of the investigator, 
and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision. 
It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick 
judgment 
of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone. Usually 
there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions. 
A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance 
today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little 
development or water. The same is true of areas which at first look 
good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually 
be poor areas to develop for general public use.   In looking for 
the best sites available that meet the requirements, you need information 
to compare the site with others. You need answers to four important 
questions.   @ What are the existing recreation features?

@ How well can the site be developed?   @ How useful 
will it be to the public?   @ Is this site available?

Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests 
already existing at the site. Naturally, a park site with scenic 
views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes, will attract more people 
than a nearby area with only trees and dunes. Quality is vitally important. 
Frontage on a body of clear, clean water will be vastly different 
from the same amount of frontage on polluted water. Some recreation 
features, such as scenic values and water interest, also have greater 
overall value than other interests.   One of the most desirable 
features for a park are beautiful views or scenery. It may be distant 
views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a 
small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual trees. A site which 
overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating 
traffic. An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf 
rolling in on a beach. A site may also be attractive just through 
the beauty of its trees and shrubs. Note extent of these interests and 
how available they will be for the public to enjoy.   Water interest 
is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation 
site. Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas. 
This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake 
provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation 
activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water sports. 
A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract 
the greatest picnic and camping use. It also cools the air in summer 
and nourishes the trees and wild life.   The amount of water 
frontage, the quantity and quality of the water, and the recreation 
afforded by it are important. A restricted frontage may be too crowded 
an area for public use. The quantity of water flow may be critical; 
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant 
or dry in late summer. If the site is on a reservoir, the level 
of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be 
studied. Check the quality of the water. A stream which has all of 
its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation 
practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one 
passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area. Other 
factors, such as water temperature, depth of water, the fish life it 
supports, wave action, flooding, etcetera, will affect its recreation 
value. ##

OTHER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest 
are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast, beaches, sand 
dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera with which the area is blessed. 
Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which 
are of national or state significance, counties should seek out these 
features which are distinctive of their area. Although the site may 
not contain the features themselves, there are often opportunities 
to include them as additional interest to the site. The route to the 
park may lead people past them or display views of them. A group of 
native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can 
be featured at the site.   The fish, animals, and birds which 
may be found at the site are another interest. Fishing interest calls 
for a check of the species found, quantity and size, the season they 
are available, and the stocking program of the fish commission. Animals 
may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas. The 
site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its 
own resident bird life. Clams, crabs, and other marine life may add 
interest at coastal areas. ##

EACH AREA has its own historical 
interests with which much can be done. Park visitors are always 
eager to learn more about the area they are in. The historical sign 
tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the 
original historical items or places themselves which still have the 
character of the period covered. Notice should be taken of unusual rock 
formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's crust in your region. 
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area 
can add geological interest to the recreation sites. An old shipwreck, 
a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other 
semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera may be of interest. 
Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian 
village sites or hunting areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera. 
How well can the site be developed? Look at the physical features 
of the land to determine how desirable it is for use, what can be done 
to correct the faults, and what it will cost to make the area meet your 
needs in comparison to other sites. Many things need to be checked: 

#SIZE AND SHAPE#- The size of the area alone can be a determining 
factor. An area may be too small for the needs of the project. 
Areas should be large enough to include the attractions, have ample 
space for the use of facilities needed, and have room around the edges 
to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments. 
Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation 
areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical 
to operate one large area than several small ones.   Shape 
of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the 
development. A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient 
in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width 
in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide. This 
is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your 
buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions. However, a 
narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide 
additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include 
scenic strips within the park unit. 

#ADJOINING AREAS#- The values 
of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands, 
ownership and use of the land, and the utilities available there. For 
instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national 
forest or a public road, may be desirable, whereas a site next 
to an industrial plant might not. The utilities available nearby may 
provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the 
site. 

#TOPOGRAPHY#- Topography is very important. Check the 
elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage, rock 
outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as subsoil. Nearly level 
areas are required for parking areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields, 
etcetera. Determine how much topography limits useful area or what 
the costs of earth moving or grading might be. 

#WATER#- In addition 
to its recreation interests, water is needed for drinking, sanitation, 
and irrigation. The quantity and quality of water sources is 
often a big factor in site selection. The area may provide good springs 
or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines. Figure 
the cost of providing water to the use areas. 

#PLANTS#- The 
existing plant growth calls for thorough checking. Look at the trees 
as to size and interest, the amount of shade they provide, how healthy 
they are, the problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw, 
etcetera.   An area may have been partially logged and requires 
removal of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of good landscaping 
value, other areas of brush may need to be cleared. The extent and location 
of open areas is noted. 

#EXPOSURE#- How much will wind, 
rain, sun, and temperature affect the use? An area sheltered from 
strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use. The direction, 
velocity, and season of these winds should be noted as to just how 
they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation 
of the area. Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for 
the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable. 
Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography 
or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or 
whatever may be most desirable for the use intended. 

#IMPROVEMENTS#- 
Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings, 
roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera which may raise the cost of 
the site.

Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 
70th Anniversary for the April issue of <Sovietskaya Muzyka> is 
accepted with pleasure, because I admire the music of Prokofieff; 
and with sober purpose, because the development of Prokofieff personifies, 
in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics.   The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the 
United States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of pranks 
and <bonheur>- and very capable as a professional musician. These 
qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic 
<haute monde> which supported the concert world of the post-World 
War /1, era. Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor 
in America was, indeed, brilliant.   Prokofieff's <Classical> 
Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted 
and well-trained musician still in his twenties. To the Traditionalists, 
it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the Neo-Classicists, 
it was a challenge to the pre-war world. What was it to Prokofieff? 
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas; a trial 
balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant <piece 
de resistance?> Certainly its composer was an ascending star 
on a new world horizon.   I heard the <Classical> Symphony 
for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927. 
All musical Paris was there. Some musicians were enthusiastic, some 
skeptical. I myself was one of the skeptics (35 years ago). I remember 
Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting in his high-pitched voice: 
"**h it may be a <tour de force, mais mon Dieu,> can anyone take 
this music seriously"?   The answer is, "Yes"! Certainly, 
America took Prokofieff and his <Classical> Symphony seriously, 
and with a good deal of pleasure. His life-long friend, Serge 
Koussevitzky, gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances 
in Boston, New York, and Washington, D& C&, to which 
he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation. Chicago was 
also a welcome host: there, in 1921, Prokofieff conducted the world 
premiere of the <Love for Three Oranges,> and played the first 
performance of his Third Piano Concerto. "Uncle Sam" was, indeed, 
a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war victory 
years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations and extravaganzas, enjoyment 
and pleasure: "The Golden Twenties". We attended the 
premieres of his concertos, symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught, 
and performed his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches; 
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities. 
We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as 
a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.

Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during 
the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western 
World- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated- 
the <chic> Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich 
America- the <avant-garde> Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky, 
Cocteau, Picasso- the <laissez-faire> Paris of Dadaism 
and ultramodern art- the Paris <sympathique> which took young 
composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.

So young Prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland; 
in the spacious hunting grounds of "Uncle Sam"; in the exciting 
salons of his lovely, brilliant Paris- mistress of gaiety- 
excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color, 
dance, design, and thought.   Meanwhile, three great terrible 
forces were coagulating and crystallizing. In this world-wide conscription 
of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled to his 
native land. The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts 
of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the 
Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist 
tyranny into cringing submission. After this holocaust, a changing world 
occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries, new 
treaties and governments, new goals and methods, and the age-old fears 
of aggression 
and subjugation- hunger and exposure.   In this 
changed world, Prokofieff settled to find himself, and to create 
for 
large national purpose. Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune 
proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic 
order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world. 
Here, Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism- 
producing music for the masses.   It is at this point in his life 
that the mature Prokofieff emerges. One might have expected that 
such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative 
flair of a composer, especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.

But no: Prokofieff grew. He accepted the environment 
of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his 
early promise. By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his 
people: "I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom, but at 
the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the 
accepted methods of harmony and melody. This is precisely what makes 
lucid, straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must 
be new, not old". How right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural 
defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not 
or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism. And 
with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words- with 
torrents of powerful music. Compare the vast difference in scope and 
beauty between his neat and witty little <Classical> Symphony and 
his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth Symphony; or the 
<Love for Three Oranges> (gay as it is) with the wonderful, imaginative, 
colorful, and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet, 
<The Stone Flower>. This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is 
the gaiety of dancing people: earthy, salty and humorous.   Of 
course, these works are not comparable, even though the same brain conceived 
them. The early works were conceived for a sophisticated, international 
audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way 
of life for fellow citizens. However, in all of Prokofieff's music, 
young or mature, we find his profile- his "signature"- his 
craftsman's attitude. Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the 
cause of experimentation <per se>. In orchestration, he stretches 
the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination 
for color. His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable. 
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and 
love songs is captivating: witty, clever, adroit, and subtle. His 
counterpoint is pertinent, skillful, and rarely thick.   Also, 
it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic 
modulations, the brilliant orchestrations, the adroitness for evading 
the heaviness of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint 
were not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular historical 
dramas of the stage and cinema, where a large, dramatic canvas of sound 
was required. That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes 
seem professionally routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that 
he was less of an "original" than we prefer to believe. Need for 
novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability. 
Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero, who, by the force of 
his creative life, helped preserve the main stream of tradition, to which 
the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually 
added and integrated.   At this date, it seems probable that the 
name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History, 
as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware of the lure and danger 
of experimentation, and used it as it served his purpose; yet 
was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics. 
Certainly, it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared 
him to the Western World- not his experimentations.   So 
Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a 
rich reward from them. Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would 
have done better, or even as well, under different circumstances. 
His fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not. Why did 
Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while Stravinsky (who leaped 
into fame like a young giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness? 
I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words: 
"the clarity must be new, not old". When Prokofieff forged his 
new clarity of "lucid, straightforward music, so difficult to compose", 
he shaped his talents to his purpose.   When Stravinsky 
shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons, 
many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself 
into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures. 
Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own 
people- by the compass of their national ideas. But Stravinsky 
was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting. In 
all his miscalculations, Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder 
of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations- 
representing many peoples, time periods and styles- into his own 
music by warping the harmony, melody, or form, to verify his own experiments. 
Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic 
materials, and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant <Petruchka,> 
his savage <Sacre du Printemps,> his incisive <Les Noces>- 
the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical 
direction for which his native talents were predisposed.   But 
time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear 
that he will never find <terra firma>. His various aesthetic postulates 
remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself: Supra-Expressionism, 
Neo-Paganism, Neo-Classicism, Neo-Romanticism, 
Neo-Jazz, Neo-Ecclesiasticism, Neo-Popularism, and most recently, 
Post-Serialism- all competing with each other within one composer! 
What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations! Meager 
and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty 
protagonist; 
a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem (<The 
Star-Spangled Banner>); a poor attempt to write an idiomatic 
jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes 
from his old music might be used for popular American commercial 
songs! Stravinsky, nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic 
bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another, searching for 
a home.   How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded. Prokofieff 
was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing 
world without losing his particular force and direction. In the process, 
his native endowments were stretched, strengthened and disciplined 
to serve their human purpose.   With a large and circumspect 
20th-Century technique, he wove the materials of national heroes and 
events, national folklore and children's fairy tales- Slavic dances 
and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his 
people well, and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large.

Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical 
feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind 
him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet 
companies; choruses, chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings; 
broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences. It 
must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many 
of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic 
security and cultural opportunities, incisive idioms, social fermentations 
for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large 
body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.   Thus 
in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced 
one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century. That his moods, 
even in his early years, are those of his people, does him honor, 
as his music honors those who inspired it. That he mastered every aspect 
of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary 
judgments, is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous 
pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture; 
and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-Century 
evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution, based on a broad 
Traditionalism for the creative art of music.

April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history- 
indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States. 
On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund, organized to furnish 
employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the 
depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes 
in the stock market crash, observed its 30th anniversary. 
ROY MASON IS ESSENTIALLY A LANDSCAPE PAINTER whose style and direction 
has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth 
century, especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell 
Cotman. And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects 
in large, simplified masses which, though they seem effortless, are 
in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough 
distillation of the natural form that inspired them.   As a 
boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the 
out-of-doors, its tang of weather, its change of seasons, its variable 
moods. His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape 
painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted 
to them his knowledge and love of nature. Out of this background of 
hunting and fishing, it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects 
he knew best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream, ducks 
and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of 
weather landscape. It is this subject matter that has brought Mason 
a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional 
performance with this motif that commends him to artists and 
discerning collectors.   Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting 
himself exclusively to painting. Like many others, he had to work 
hard, long hours in a struggling family business which, though it was 
allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals- 
bore no relation to the painting of pictures. But it did teach 
Roy the basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for twelve years, 
he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia. 
On the death of their father, they returned to their home 
in Batavia, New York. After more years of concentrated effort, Roy 
and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business 
at the old stand.   During all this time Roy continued to paint, 
first only on weekends, and then, as the family business permitted, 
for longer periods. Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether, 
and for the past thirty years, he has worked independently as a painter, 
except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions. But even 
on these, the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!

Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey Ryder 
who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and 
this was limited to a few lessons, though the two artists often went on 
painting trips together- Roy developed his art by himself. In the 
best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then to draw with accuracy 
and assurance, and then to paint. He worked in oil for years before 
beginning his work in watercolor, and his first public recognition 
and early honors, including his election to the Academy, were for 
his essays in the heavier medium. Gradually watercolor claimed his greater 
affection until today it has become his major, if not exclusive, 
technique.   It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason 
on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia. More often 
than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at 
a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature 
into a composed, not imitative, painting. What I have observed 
time and time again is a process of integration, integration that begins 
as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color 
patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition; 
and that over-all, amazing control of large washes which is the Mason 
stylemark. Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the 
job is done. Inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable- 
no!   But for the technical fact, we have the artist's 
own testimony:   "Of late years, I find that I like best to 
work out-of-doors. First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in 
quarter scale (approximately **f inches) in which I pay particular attention 
to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest 
light, the middle tone, and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms 
of my subject to these large patterns. If a human figure or wild life 
are to be part of the projected final picture, I try to place them 
in the initial sketch. For me, these will belong more completely to 
their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though 
I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on 
the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.   "I am thoroughly 
convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects 
nature will do his composing for him; as a result, such pictures are 
only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before 
him. Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot 
is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting, 
unless the position serves the design of the whole composition. 
If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain 
units in his design, often only slightly, finer pictures would result. 
Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other 
objects like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the original 
sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they 
occupy the right position, which I call 'clicking'.   "Speed 
in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity 
and crispness, but unless the artist has lots of experience so that 
he can control rapid execution, he would do well to take these first sketches 
and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.

"If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition, 
I mean to project equal concern for color. Often, in working 
out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere, a particular 
passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be 
too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when viewed indoors in 
a mat. When this occurs, I make the change on the sketch or on the 
final watercolor- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field.

"When working from one of my sketches I square it up and 
project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal. 
When this linear draft is completed, I dust it down to a faint 
image. From this point, I paint in as direct a manner as possible, by 
flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage. 
However, first 
I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and 
design along the lines I have described. Then I plan my attack: 
the parts I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting of 
minor details- all in all, mechanics of producing the finished job 
with a maximum of crispness. The longer I work, the more I am sure 
that for me, at least, a workmanlike method is important. Trial and 
error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles 
in the final painting.   "As for materials, I use the 
best available. I work on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently 
resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue 
strain. In my studio I work at a tilt-top table, but leave the paper 
unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes. I have 
used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English 
make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight. After selecting a sheet 
and inspecting it for flaws (even the best sometimes has foreign 'nubbins' 
on its surface), I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with 
clean, cold water. Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that 
it will lie flat as a board.   "In addition to the usual tools, 
I make constant use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes, 
but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to open up lights 
in dark washes. The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that 
it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the 
watercolorist. I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large 
washes in the studio.

"My brushes are different from those used 
by most watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle. The 
red sables are @8; two riggers, @6 and @10; and a very large, 
flat wash brush. The bristles are a Fitch @2 and a one-half 
inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.   "My usual palette 
consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna, 
raw umber, burnt sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French 
ultramarine blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green @2, cadmium yellow 
pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's gray, 
and ivory black".   In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason, 
the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness, 
yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration 
here. True, a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis 
of nature rather than a detailed inventory. Unlike many decorative patterns 
that present a static flat convention, this artist's pictures 
are full of atmosphere and climate.   Long observation has taught 
Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes: 
a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents 
or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the 
major motif; and a background, usually a silhouetted form foiled against 
the sky. In following this general principle, Mason provides the 
observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background, 
and the illusion of depth is instantly created.   When painting, 
Mason's physical eyes are half-closed, while his mind's eye 
is wide open, and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression 
he wishes to convey. He does not insist on telling all he knows about 
any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw 
on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia. It is for this 
reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition 
of place for their enjoyment. His pictures generalize, though 
they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms 
of weather, skies, earth, and people. By dealing with common landscape 
in an uncommon way, Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American 
landscape art. Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience 
of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor, 
a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor 
the Creator of it all.   The artist was born in Gilbert Mills, 
New York, in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife moved 
to California, he lived in western New York, in Batavia. When 
I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 
15th, I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for 
a watercolorist: the water sign of Pisces (February 18-March 20). 
And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes, and 
how appropriate that he should appear in AMERICAN ARTIST again, 
in his natal month of March!   Over the years, beginning in 
1929, Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold 
medals; two Ranger Fund purchase awards; the Joseph Pennell 
Memorial Medal; two American Watercolor Society prizes; the Blair 
Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute of Chicago; 
and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua, New Haven, Rochester, 
Rockport, and most recently, the $300 prize for a watercolor at 
the Laguna Beach Art Association,   He was elected to the National 
Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 
(after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy 
in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940. Other memberships 
include the American Watercolor Society, Philadelphia Water 
Color Club, Allied Artists of America, Audubon Artists, Baltimore 
Watercolor Society.

The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts 
in the 1960 Olympics for one reason- they were better. They were 
better trained, better looking, better built, better disciplined **h 
and something else- <they were better dancers>. Our athletes are 
only just beginning to learn that they must study dance. The Russians 
are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.

But why gymnastics at all? And is the sport really important? 
After all, we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics 
competition. But if it is important, what can we do to improve ourselves? 
It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem, 
for just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has some very 
important things to learn from gymnastics.   Taking first things 
first, let's understand the sport called gymnastics. It is made up 
of tumbling, which might be said to start with a somersault, run through 
such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels, backbends, and 
culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists 
**h and apparatus work. The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a 
common sight in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in favor 
of games. The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard, horizontal bar, 
rings, and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball, 
volleyball, basketball and football.   But the Russians use 
gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because 
it provides training in every basic quality except one, endurance. The 
gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination, timing, 
rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and the desire for perfection. 
In short, gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great 
deal of character as well. The addition of endurance training later, 
when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury, 
provides that final quality that makes the top athlete, soldier 
or citizen.   Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that 
it can be started very early in life. (An enterprising teacher or parent 
<could> start training a healthy child at the age of seven days. 
Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries.) 
In most sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on the side 
of those who begin young, and the Russian competitor of 16 has at 
least thirteen years of training behind him. The American is very lucky 
if he has three.   If a nation wished to get a head start in 
physical fitness over all other nations, it would start its kindergarten 
students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus 
eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools. 
First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension, 
since action relieves both. Oddly enough, it is proven that there 
would be less reading difficulty. Certainly there would be less anxiety, 
fewer accidents (it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries), 
and higher scholastic averages, since alert children work better. 
Russia knows this, and that is why there were over 800,000 competing 
for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team. Eighty 
thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself. We 
could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.

And what has dancing to do with all this? A great deal. 
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous 
training on apparatus. Well-stretched, trained in posture and coordinated 
movement, and wedded to rhythm, they presented the audiences 
in 
Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic 
contest. American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons. 
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing 
with incredible grace. They were further stripped of old wive's 
tales 
by seeing the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring 
tremendous strength **h and with not one bulging muscle.   President 
Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation. If 
we wait until children are in junior high or high school, we will never 
manage it. To be fit, one has to start early with young children, 
and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher 
of dance. If the dance teachers of America make it their business 
to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come 
some day if our schools are really responsible, we will be that much 
ahead. School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they must do, 
will need demonstrators. There should be youngsters who know how to do 
a headstand, and also how to help other children learn it. They should 
know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for 
the sports we will demand be taught.   Dance teachers can respond 
to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular 
dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes 
for strength and flexibility.   Very little in today's living 
provides the strength we need **h and nothing provides the flexibility. 
Dancers do have flexibility. They often fail, however, to develop 
real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength. Ask any group 
of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results, 
considering the amount of physical training they have had, will be 
very disappointing. Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas. 
This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of 
the 11-year-old boys in America <cannot chin themselves once>, and 
that English school girls outdo them in almost every test (even dashes 
and endurance). The only area in which American boys hold their own 
is the baseball throw. 

#THE CHINNING BAR#

For arm and shoulder 
strength a chinning bar is recommended. It should be installed over 
a door that is in full view of everyone, and a chair should be placed 
under it, a little to one side. Those children who can chin themselves 
should be told to do <one> chin up each time they pass under it. 
Those who are too weak, should climb on the chair and, starting at the 
top of the chin, let themselves <slowly> down. When they can take 
ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have the strength to 
chin <up>. Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged 
to do the same with the whole family at home. 

#THE HORSE KICK# 

Arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength will be aided with 
the Horse Kick. Start on hands and feet. Keeping the hands in 
the starting position, run in place to a quick rhythm. After this has 
become easy, use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher. 
Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on 
all fours, kicking as high as possible. 

#PUSH-UPS#

Push-ups are 
essential, but few have the strength for them at first. Start on the 
knees in a large circle. Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let 
the body down to rest on the floor. Push back up and repeat. Do this 
exercise six times each class period. As strength improves start in 
a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward. 
Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength 
improves, fall farther and farther out. Try to push back to the stand 
position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes 
from the hands. The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the 
<top> of the push-up with legs spread wide. Let the body down slowly, 
taking at least five seconds for the letting <down>. Five of these 
done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-<up>. 

#HANDSTANDS#

Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders 
have developed at least a minimum of strength. Of course those 
who have developed more will find them easier. Start with the class 
standing in a circle, with weight on the right foot and the left extended 
a little way into the circle. At first each child should do a kick 
up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work 
alone, and those who need help. Drop both hands to the floor and at the 
same time kick the right foot up in back. The left will follow at 
once. The right will land first, followed by the left. Return to the 
standing position. Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed 
on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot 
is brought as close to the hands as possible. This will prevent flat 
falls and toe injuries. Bare feet are better for such work than any 
form of slipper. Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough 
so that the teacher can catch the leading leg. The child should 
then bring both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten the 
seat muscles. Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the 
hands and that only one foot lands at a time. 

#BACKBENDS#

The backbend 
is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics, and, 
as with all acrobatics, the sooner begun the better the results. Have 
the class lie supine with knees apart and bent. Place flat palms on 
either side of the head a few inches away from the ears, <fingers pointing 
toward the shoulders>. Arch the back upwards to make a bridge. 
Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor 
rather than toward the ceiling. As flexibility improves, the feet will 
move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher. Later this can 
be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover. 

#BACK CIRCLE# 

To further increase back flexibility, work on the back circle. Have 
the class lie prone. Place the hands in front of the chest. Keep 
the legs straight and the toes pointed. Straighten the arms slowly, 
this arches the back. At the peak of the arch, tip the head back and 
bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head. Improvement can be 
measured by the lessening distance between toes and head. 

#SOMERSAULTS# 

The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the 
somersault, or forward roll. This used to be part of every child's 
bag of tricks, but few children can do it today; some are actually 
incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting 
or standing upright. For most small children, learning a forward 
roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can. After it has 
been seen, have the child start on a mat on hands and knees (a thin, 
inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require 
falling). He places the hands on either side of the head, keeping 
the chin down on the chest. He then pushes his seat into the air and 
the teacher guides it over. One or two practice runs should be sufficient 
for solo. If, however, the child is weak, overweight, or afraid, 
more help will be needed. When the child raises his seat into the air, 
the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter 
what happens, the child's performance will be controlled. By lifting 
the seat upwards a little, the weight is taken off the neck and 
the back is kept rounded.   These are beginnings, but correctly 
learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed 
by a strong, flexible body (we are not talking of eccentric extremes). 
Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler 
will be a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being with 
a greater margin of safety in any activity.   It is very important 
for parents to understand that early training is imperative. And dancing 
school, so helpful in artistic and psychological development, also 
contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute 
even more.

EVERY taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual 
defense 
budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion 
of these expenditures go for military electronics. We have noted how 
some electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort, have evenutally 
been used in commerce and industry. The host of novel applications 
of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because 
of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.

When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment, 
the prospect is staggering. The author has recently studied 
the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that, in this 
area alone, the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities. 
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be 
greater by far than any previous medical discovery. We use the term 
"bio-medicine" because of the close interrelation between biology 
and medical research.   Electronics has been applied to medicine 
for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine, 
the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy machine. Recently many 
doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage 
of bruises, 
contusions, and simple bursitis.   Commonly used electronic 
devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit 
~TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction, 
along with radiation counters, timers, and similar devices.

In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application 
of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this 
is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates. From the wealth 
of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques 
perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which 
appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely 
new tools in medical research. 

#ULTRAVIOLET MICROSCOPY# 

Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are transparent to visible 
light and must be stained for microscopic investigation. This stain 
often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside. 
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure 
will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light 
with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-~TV 
system to view the results.   Fig& 1 is a simplified block 
diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical 
Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute. By combining the 
talents of a medical man, Dr& Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr& 
Berkely, 
and an electronics expert, Dr& Zworykin, this novel technique 
has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding 
life processes.   Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet 
radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the 
three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources. 
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the 
rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope. Instead 
of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the ~TV camera 
does the "looking". The microscope and orthicon are both selected 
to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that all 
lenses must be quartz.   The video signal is amplified and then 
switched, in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which 
are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of 
a second only one wavelength, corresponding to red, green, or blue, is 
seen. (Note: Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source 
to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated 
by a synchronous motor. This assembly also supplies a 20-~cps 
switching gate for the electronics circuitry.) This is the same system 
as was used in the field-sequential color-~TV system which preceded 
the present simultaneous system. Three separate amplifiers then 
drive a 21-inch tricolor tube. The result is a color picture of the 
specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet 
wavelengths.   Many of the cells and microorganisms which 
are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter 
wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum. Different parts of these cells 
sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often 
possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color. 
Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows 
or nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation 
into a color ~TV picture reveal a wealth of detail.   At the 
present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is 
primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it. 

#BREATHING- 
ELECTRONICALLY ANALYZED#

The medical title of "Lobar Ventilation 
in Man" by Drs& C& J& Martin and A& C& Young, covers 
a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics 
to the study of the respiratory process. At the University 
of Washington Medical School, the electronics group has developed 
the "Respiratory Gas Analyzer" shown in Fig& 3. This unit, 
affectionately dubbed "The Monster", can be wheeled to any convenient 
location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's 
breathing.   In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder 
indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper 
and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume of inhalation per breath, 
the flow of air from both lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes 
with respect to each other. Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece 
while walking a treadmill, standing still, or in some other medically 
significant position. From the resulting data the doctor can determine 
lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail. 

#HEART-MEASURING 
TECHNIQUES#

The original electrocardiograph primarily 
indicates irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques allow 
exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta, dimensioning 
of the heart and its chambers, and a much more detailed study of 
each heartbeat. For many of these measurements the chest must be opened, 
but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.

A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given 
a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques. One simple 
method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber 
tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change 
in resistance as the tube is stretched. A balanced resistance bridge 
and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.

Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing 
small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel 
and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy. The travel 
time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes 
about 16 
|msec& to traverse 25 mm& of tissue. A sonar or radar-type 
of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for 
body-tissue evaluation. In addition to the heart and aorta, successful 
measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique. 
The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic signals, can be employed to 
measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.

A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining 
the effective power of the heart itself. It uses both an ultrasonic 
dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor 
inserted into the bloodstream. The latter measures the heat carried 
away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood 
flow. It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted 
at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left 
ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself. This pressure 
measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning 
measurement is made. A simplified version of the instrumentation 
for this procedure is shown in Fig& 2. Outputs of the two 
systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge, 
followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder. 
From this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter, pressure, 
and effective heart power. 

#RADIO-TRANSMITTER PILLS#

Several 
years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule 
which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal 
pressure data to external receivers. This original capsule contained 
a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm& in 
diameter. Battery life limited the use of this "pill" to about 8 
to 30 hours maximum.   A refinement of this technique has been described 
by Drs& Zworykin and Farrar and Mr& Berkely of the Medical 
Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute. In this 
novel arrangement the "pill" is much smaller and contains only a resonant 
circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing 
transducer. As shown in Fig& 4, an external antenna is placed over 
or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc& 
bursts. The energy received by the "pill" causes the resonant 
circuit to "ring" on after the burst and this "ringing" takes 
place at the resonant frequency of the "pill". These frequencies 
are amplified and detected by the ~FM receiver after each burst 
of transmitted energy and, after the "pill" has been calibrated, 
precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.   One of 
the advantages of this method is that the "pill" can remain in the 
patient for several days, permitting observation under natural conditions. 
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are 
planned for future experiments. 

#SONAR IN MEDICAL RESEARCH#

One 
of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine 
detection is in the exploration of the human body. Our readers 
are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent 
out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects. Various 
methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used 
to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water. 
In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the 
sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques 
may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.

Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission of 
ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels. 
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic 
signals. Based on this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used 
this method to "look through" human organs. A good example of 
the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers 
presented by Dr& G& Baum who has explored the human eye. He 
can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate 
blindness due to glaucoma. The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically 
is illustrated in Fig& 6. The transducer is coupled to the 
body through a water bath, not shown. For display, Dr& Baum uses 
a portion of an **f, an airborne radar indicator, and then photographs 
the screen to obtain a permanent record.   A typical "sonogram" 
of a human eye, together with a description of the anatomical 
parts, is shown in Fig& 5. The frequency used for these experiments 
is 15 mc& and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy 
lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter. 
The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan, just like 
a radar antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 
90-degree arc in front of the eye to "look into" all corners. 
The total 
picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector 
scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.   Drs& 
Howry 
and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied 
the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have 
obtained extremely good results. By submerging the patient in a tub 
and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on, they have been 
able to get cross-section views of the neck, as shown in Fig& 7, as 
well as many other hitherto impossible insights. As mentioned before, 
bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig& 7 the portion of the 
spine shows as the black area in the center. Arteries and veins are apparent 
by their black, blood-filled centers and the surrounding white 
walls.   A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in 
Fig& 8 with the various parts labeled.

OERSTED'S boyhood represented a minimal chance of either 
attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a 
span of life. He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on 
the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 
14, 1777. His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender 
income made it difficult to feed his family, let alone educate 
them in a town without even a school. The two older boys, Hans and Anders, 
his junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home of a 
warm 
and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German; his wife 
taught the two boys to read and write Danish. Other brothers later joined 
them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic 
was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal 
curriculum. Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the 
boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned, such as 
the pastor, to supplement the simple teaching. From the town surveyor, 
Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university student, 
some academic subjects. The mayor of the town taught them English 
and French. Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed 
on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the 
village. At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in 
the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his interest in medicine 
and science. His earlier love for literature and history remained with 
him for his entire life.   In 1793 the brothers decided to enter 
the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following 
spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the 
autumn session. While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine, 
physics, and astronomy, his brother studied law. The brothers continued 
to help each other during their studies, sharing a joint purse, 
lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of 
their aunt. They supplemented their income by small government assistance, 
by tutoring and economizing wherever they could. So impressive 
were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later 
wrote, "to be perfectly free, the young man must revel in the great 
kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there, in which, 
if he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is freedom 
of utterance there, which draws after it no irreparable consequences on 
society **h. I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day 
overcame a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a previous 
error". He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing 
about science. In this third year at the university, Hans, in 1797, 
was awarded the first important token of recognition, a gold medal for 
his essay on "Limits of Poetry and Prose". He completed his training 
in pharmacy also, taking his degree with high honors in 1797, 
and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with 
a prize for an essay in medicine. He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis 
which later was accepted in chemical practices. 

#FERMENT OF SCIENTIFIC 
ACTIVITY#

HAN'S STUDENT DAYS were at a time when Europe 
was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America 
and in France, Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms 
and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the 
Continent.   The new century opened with Oersted beginning 
his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen 
and as lecturer at the university. He was stirred by the announcement 
of Volta's 
discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied 
the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis. The following 
year he devoted to the customary "Wanderjahr", traveling in 
Germany, France, and the Netherlands, meeting the philosophers Schelling, 
Fichte, and Tieck. He also met Count Rumford (born Benjamin 
Thompson in Woburn, Mass&) who was then serving the Elector 
of Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter; these were Oersted's main 
contacts in science.   From Go^ttingen (1801) where he stayed 
for 10 days, he wrote, "The first question asked everywhere is 
about galvanism. As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass 
tubes I have invented, I have had quite a small one made here of 
four glass 
tubes (in Copenhagen I used 30) and intend to carry it with me". 
Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks, continuing 
their correspondence after he left. With Ritter he was exposed 
to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's 
fertile but disorganized mind. Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes 
into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut de France 
for its annual prize of 3,000 francs. The sound discoveries of 
this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize 
was never awarded to him. In May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight 
of fancy, wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy. 
He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and 
indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided 
with the years of important electrical discoveries. Thus, 1745 corresponded 
to the invention of the "Leiden" jar by Kleist, 1764 
that of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser of 
Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile. Ritter proceeded, "You now emerge 
into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820, you will have 
to reckon. This we might well witness". Ritter died in 1810 and 
Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of 
it.   In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for 
the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably 
considered more a philosopher than a physicist. However, he continued 
experimenting and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments 
in German and Danish periodicals. In 1806 his ambition was 
realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University, 
though not realizing full professorship (ordinarius) until 1817.

During Oersted's attendance at the university, it was poorly 
equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences. 
He was, however, fortunate in his contact with Prof& J& G& 
L& Manthey (1769-1842), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to 
his academic chair, was 
also proprietor of the "Lion Pharmacy" in 
Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him. Manthey maintained a valuable 
collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's 
disposal during and after his graduation. In 1800, Manthey went 
abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy. In 
February 1801, Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus 
and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates 
of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates 
of zinc and lead. In the following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously 
with Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic 
battery more than did salts. Eager as he was to pursue this promising 
line, he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy 
and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university 
that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to "galvanizing".

He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and 
thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood. The 
university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor 
represented the upper social level. His broad interest in literary, political, 
and philosophical movements opened many doors to him. His friends 
were numerous and their ties to him were strong.   The years 
1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again, but on this 
visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his 
first journey. In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws 
of nature in German and this was issued in French translation (Paris, 
1813) under the title <Recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques 
et electriques,> a work held in very high esteem by the new 
generation 
of research chemists. His interest in finding a relationship between 
voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated. Chapter 
/8, is entitled "On Magnetism" and in it are included such 
remarks as, "One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces 
with the electrical forces. The great resemblance between electrical 
and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their 
laws necessarily would bring about this comparison. It is true, that 
nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication; 
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those 
depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest 
difference **h. The form of galvanic activity is halfway between 
the magnetic form and the electrical form. There, forces are more latent 
than in electricity, and less than in magnetism **h. But in such 
an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that 
the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity 
and magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is 
contrary to it **h. One could also add to these analogies that steel 
loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better 
conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do. 
It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature, as 
proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb. By that, one feels that magnetic 
forces are as general as electrical forces. An attempt should be made 
to see if electricity, in its most latent stage, has any action on the 
magnet as such". His plan and intent were clearly charted. 
Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and 
political discussions. In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment 
as opposed to dogma, in another he held that the practice of science 
was in fact an act of religious worship. He continued as a popular 
lecturer. He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was 
caused to glow by an electric current.   In 1819 under royal command 
he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm, 
one of the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in the expedition. 
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition, 
Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light 
by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric 
current was made to flow. Together they also developed a new 
form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of 
copper, thereby producing stronger currents. Esmarch was among those 
who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery. 

#DISCOVERY 
OF ELECTROMAGNETISM#

THE ASSOCIATION between electric 
(both electrostatic and voltaic) forces and magnetic forces had been 
recognized by investigators for many decades. Electrical literature 
contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and 
had altered the polarity of compass needles. In the late 1700's 
Beccaria and van Marum, among others, had magnetized iron by sending 
an electrostatic charge through it. Beccaria had almost stumbled on 
a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge 
from a Leyden jar was sent <transversally> through a piece 
of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic. The resulting magnetic 
effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise. 
The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but 
no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these 
two primary forces. Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive, 
possibly because he had, like other experimenters, laid the conducting 
wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.

The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains 
ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the 
university related that the first direct event that led to the publication 
of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made 
before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820. At 
this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel 
to a magnetic needle. 
Knowing <specifically> what the many feed additives can do and 
how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more 
profitable for beef, dairy, and sheep men.   The <target chart> 
quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what. All the additives 
listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration 
of the federal government. All comments concerning effectiveness 
and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary 
medical officer with ~FDA.   This article assumes that the 
rations you are feeding your beef, dairy cattle, and sheep are adequately 
balanced with protein, vitamins, and minerals.   The drug's 
chemical name is listed, since most states require feed processors 
to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag. In some instances, 
the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical

There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle: 
(1) Fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed 
is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons; 
(2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot, are filled 
by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; (3) Special bunks- 
as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides. Feed is 
put in with an elevator.   Several materials or combinations of 
materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk. The selection 
of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation, 
cost of materials available locally, and your own preference. No 
one material is best for all situations. Selecting bunks by economic 
comparison is usually an individual problem. 

#FENCE-LINE FEEDING.# 

Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk must be twice 
as long as the mechanical bunk. These bunks also serve as a fence, 
so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence. Because 
of their location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks are 
not in the way of mechanical manure removal. Filling these bunks by 
the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the 
wagons over more time and operations.   All-weather roads must 
be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all 
year. This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall. 
MARKETING in the new decade will be no picnic- for the sixties 
will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you 
have experienced in the last 20-25 yr&.   Why? Companies of 
all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies- 
in modern equipment and new processes, enlarged ~R+D 
facilities, faster new product development. Many companies have upgraded 
their sales manpower and tested new selling, distribution, and promotion 
techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.   Given this 
kind of business climate, what competitive marketing problems will your 
company face in the next 10 yr&? Based on our experience with 
clients, we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups- 
the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing management. 

#1. PROBLEMS IN THE MARKET#

_@ GREATER PRICE-CONSCIOUSNESS._ 
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent 
years; there is every indication it will continue. Frequently, wittingly 
or unwittingly, price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers, 
distributors, and dealers. Despite generally good levels of 
income, we see greater price pressures than ever before- traveling 
back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.

Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy 
will be on target:   Has the probable price situation in 
your field been forecast as a basis for future planning? Have cost 
studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might 
be done if things get worse? Have you actually checked out (not 
just mentally tested) different selling approaches designed to counter 
the price competition problem? _@ INCREASED CUSTOMER SOPHISTICATION._ 
Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding 
product and advertising claims, partly because of widespread criticism 
of such assertions. This problem can force a change in marketing approach 
in many kinds of businesses. Have you examined this problem of 
increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company? 
_@ GREATER DEMAND FOR SERVICES._ Need for service is here 
to stay- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the 
sixties. There are two reasons for this. First, most products tend to 
become more complex. Second, in a competitive market, the customer 
feels his weight and throws it around.   {Providing good customer 
service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning 
job as the original selling of the product}. Too often it is 
thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.   Good 
service starts with product design and planning: Many products seem 
to be designed for a production economy, not for a service one. Proper 
follow-through requires training your own sales organization, and 
your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques but also 
in good customer relations.   Have you assessed the importance of 
service and given it proper attention? _@ WIDER DISCRETIONARY 
CHOICES FOR CUSTOMERS._ In spending his money today, the consumer is 
pulled in many directions. To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type 
product- the purchase of which can be switched, delayed, or 
put off entirely- the implications are important. Your competition 
is now proportionately greater- you are competing not only against manufacturers 
in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers 
of other appealing consumer products.   Many industry trade 
associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share 
of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products. 
Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole "discretionary 
buying" area? _@ GEOGRAPHIC SHIFT OF CUSTOMERS._ 
The trends have been in evidence for many years- population shifts 
to the Southwest and Far West, and from city to suburbs. These shifts 
will continue in the next 10 yr&. Have you considered the implications 
of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation, 
strength of distributor organizations, and even plant location? 
_@ MARKET CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION IN FEWER ACCOUNTS._ We 
have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions 
in the food industry- at both the manufacturing and retail ends. 
Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts, there are now larger 
sales to or through fewer accounts.   The change may require 
different products, pricing, packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising 
and executive attention- practically every link in the marketing 
network may have to be adjusted. Have you examined these trends, 
forecast the effects, and planned your marketing strategy to compete 
effectively under changing circumstances? 

#2. PROBLEMS IN MARKETING 
METHODS#

_@ MORE PRIVATE LABEL COMPETITION._ In the area 
of private label competition, it is logical to expect a continuation of 
trends which have been under way during the first decade. As mass dealer 
and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason 
to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the 
distributor's profits- which is, in effect, what the sale of private 
brands tends to do.   {Average manufacturer frequently has 
helped build private brand business, delivering largely the same qualities 
and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded}. Moreover, 
the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain 
stores have insisted on high quality- and the customer seems to have 
caught on.   If you are up against private brand competition, 
have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening 
your market position? If private brand competition hasn't been 
felt in your product field as yet, have you thought how you will cope 
with it if and when it does appear? _@ LESS PERSONAL SALESMANSHIP._ 
Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through advertising 
and promotion, will continue to make strides in the sixties. It 
has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program.

How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet 
and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are 
still important? If you have a higher-quality product, how can you 
make it stand out- justify its premium price- without the spoken 
word? Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different brand 
of salesmanship.   Have you carefully examined the selling techniques 
which best suit your products? Have you studied the caliber 
and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements 
for effective marketing? Are you experimenting with different selling 
slants in developing new customers? _@ HIGHER COSTS OF DISTRIBUTION 
GENERALLY._ Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive 
pressure, some by the fact that the customers have come to expect 
certain niceties and flourishes. {No manufacturer has taken the initiative 
in pointing out the costs involved}.   The use of bulk 
handling is continuously growing. Computers are being used to keep branch 
inventories at more workable levels. "Selective selling"- 
concentrating sales on the larger accounts- has been used effectively 
by some manufacturers.   There may be possible economies at any 
one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain. Do 
you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully- 
and with some imagination? In your sales force, will a 
smaller number of higher-priced, high-quality salesmen serve you best, 
or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?

Will your trade customers settle for less attention and 
fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share? In one company 
covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men, the 
president personally phones each major account every 6 mos&. As a 
result, distribution costs were cut, customer relations improved.

Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties- 
and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study 
each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job. 
_@ HIGHER COSTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION._ From the manufacturer's 
point of view, the increasing cost of advertising and promotion 
is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties. It is accentuated 
by the need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.

How much fundamental thinking and research has your company 
done on its advertising program? Are you following competition willy-nilly- 
trying to match dollar for dollar- or are you experimenting 
with new means for reaching and influencing consumers? Have you 
evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion 
in your total marketing program- from the standpoint of effort, money, 
and effectiveness? _@ INCREASING TEMPO OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT._ 
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products 
on the horizon. Will you be out in the market place with some of these 
sales-building new products?   If competition beats you to it, 
this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store. On 
the other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing 
the new one is usually mighty expensive. As markets become larger 
and marketing more complex, the costs of an error become progressively 
larger.   Is your ~R+D or product development program tuned 
in to the commercial realities of the market? Are there regular communications 
from the field, or meetings of sales and marketing personnel 
with ~R+D people? {Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing, 
but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register}.

Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd 
a new product through to commercialization; who can develop reliable 
estimates of sales volume, production, and distribution costs; and 
translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which 
management can act on with some assurance? We have seen good new 
products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts 
and plans- and management couldn't make up its mind. 

#3. PROBLEMS 
IN MARKETING MANAGEMENT#

_@ SHORTAGE OF SKILLED SALESMEN._ 
There is a shortage of salesmen today. In the future, quantitative 
demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy, and 
the qualitative need will be greater still.   While many companies 
have done fine work in developing sales personnel, much of it has been 
product rather than sales training. Nor has the training been enough 
in relation to the need. Most marketing people agree it is going 
to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements.   Have 
you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future (both quantitatively 
and qualitatively)? Has your company developed selection and 
training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen 
you will need in the next 10 yr&? _@ SHORTAGE OF SALES MANAGEMENT 
TALENT._ With the growing complexity of markets and intensity 
of competition, sales management, whether at the district, region or 
headquarters level, is a tough job today- and it will be tougher in 
the future. Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager 
are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications 
called for by this type of management work. The growth of business 
has outdistanced the available supply, and the demand will continue to 
exceed the supply in the sixties.   Does your company have a program 
for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel 
for the longer term? Does your management climate and your management 
compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people? 
_@ COMPLEXITY OF COMPLETE MARKETING PLANNING._ Every single 
problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning. "Hip-pocket" 
tactics are going to be harder to apply. Many food and 
beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis. They have 
to be. With greater investments in plant facilities, with automation 
growing, you can't switch around, either in volume or in product 
design, as much as was formerly possible- or at least not as economically.

Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently 
in your company? We find too many sales and marketing executives 
so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning.

Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management 
group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the 
marketing team? Do you have a long-term (5- or 10-yr&) marketing 
program?   The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining 
your company's marketing problems realistically. Solutions 
frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems, 
whether they be in the market, in marketing methods or in marketing 
management.   If companies will take the time to give objective 
consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke, 
then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective 
marketing in next decade. 
The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior 
designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought 
clearly into focus one important difference of opinion. The architects 
do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently 
good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect 
and that, therefore, the interior designer is incapable of understanding 
the architectural principles involved in planning the interior 
of a building.   Ordinary politeness may have militated against 
this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance 
in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables, workshops 
or panel discussions- whatever they are called- on this subject 
will recognize that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is 
education.   It is true that most architectural schools have five 
year courses, some even have six or more. The element of public danger 
which enters so largely into architectural certification, however, 
would demand a prolonged study of structure. This would, naturally, 
lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior 
designer's training.   We may then dismiss the time difference 
between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior 
design student as not having serious bearing on the subject. The 
real question that follows is- how are those four years used and what 
is their value as training?   The American Institute of Interior 
Designers has published a recommended course for designers and 
a percentage layout of such a course. An examination of some forty 
catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design, for the most 
part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of 
Schools of Art, and a further "on the spot" inspection of a number 
of schools, show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations. 
One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum, but 
the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to 
the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.

The suggested course of the A&I&D& was based 
on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to 
curricular necessities. Obviously, the four year provision limits this 
to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.

Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses- architecture 
versus interior design- let us examine the educational needs 
of the interior designer.   To begin with, what is an interior 
designer? "The Dictionary of Occupational Titles" published 
by the U& S& Department of Labor describes him as follows: "Designs, 
plans and furnishes interiors of houses, commercial and institutional 
structures, hotels, clubs, ships, theaters, as well as set 
decorations for motion picture arts and television. Makes drawings and 
plans of rooms showing placement of furniture, floor coverings, wall 
decorations, and determines color schemes.   Furnishes complete 
cost estimates for clients approval. Makes necessary purchases, places 
contracts, supervises construction, installation, finishing and placement 
of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings, and follows 
through to completion of project".   In addition to this 
the U& S& Civil Service Bureau, when examining applicants for 
government positions as interior designers, expects that "when various 
needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them. 
He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture 
of any craft materials needed in the furnishings".   This 
seems like a large order. The interior designer, then, must first be 
an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and 
plumbing and finance. Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this 
and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice 
it. And further he must understand his obligation to the client 
to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve 
his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.

Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording 
of their curriculum. It is in the quality of the teaching of all this 
that a question may arise.   The old established independent art 
schools try their best to fulfill their obligations. Yet even here 
many a problem is presented; as in a recent design competition with 
a floor plan and the simple command- "design a luxury apartment"; 
no description of the client or his cultural level, no assertion of 
geographical area or local social necessities- simply "a luxury 
apartment". Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only 
in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may 
please the public relations department but have little to do with the 
essence of interior design.   It is possible, of course, to work 
on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will 
explain their necessities so that the student may get "the feel" 
of real interior design demands. Unfortunately, the purely synthetic 
problem is the rule.   It is like medical schools in India where, 
in that fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection of dead 
bodies is frowned upon. Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs 
of plants. Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense 
of actual experience.   In the earlier years of training certain 
phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its 
use. But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.

Consultation with architects, clients, real estate men, 
fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development 
of class problems just as in actual work. Fortunately, although 
only a few years ago they held the student at arms length, today 
the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student, not only 
from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from 
the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of 
tomorrow- that the student already is "in the trade".   Even 
the "history of furniture" can hardly be taught exclusively from 
photographs and lantern slides. Here, too, the reality of actual furniture 
must be experienced.   The professional organizations such 
as American Institute of Interior Designers, National Society 
of Interior Designers, Home Fashions League and various trade associations, 
can and do aid greatly in this work. Certainly every educator 
involved in interior design should be a member and active in thework 
of one of these organizations.   Not only should every educator 
above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of 
the professional organizations, but his first qualification for membership 
as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership 
would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.

Participation for the educator in this case, however, would have to 
be raised to full and complete membership. The largest of these organizations 
at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the 
conduct and standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even the 
right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.

This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower 
his standing in the eyes of the students. The professor in turn 
dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in 
the policies and standards of which he has no voice.   This seems 
somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications 
for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced, the 
educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands.

In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to 
the schools. That is in the continuance of the "grandfather clauses" 
in their membership requirements.   When these groups were 
first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have 
had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were 
rare and 
undeveloped during their youth. Long hard years of "on the 
job" training had brought them to their competence.   The necessity 
of that day has long disappeared. There is plenty of opportunity 
for proper education today. It is discouraging for students to realize 
that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they 
are supposed to stand.   The reason and the day of "grandfather 
clauses" has long since passed. No one can deny that these "back 
door" admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused 
nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents 
to membership in supposedly learned societies.   Beyond 
any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality 
of the teachers themselves. It will occur to anyone that the teacher 
must have adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge far 
beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication 
to his subject and to his students. The local decorator who rushes 
in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these 
qualifications.   Nor will the hack, the Jack-of-all-trades, still 
found in some of the smaller art schools, suffice.   Only a 
few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher 
of interior design. At the end of its letter was the information 
that applicants for this position "must also be prepared to teach costume 
design and advertising art". This kind of irresponsibility toward 
their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude 
in the future designer.   We must build a corp of highly professional 
teachers of interior design who have had education, experience 
in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments 
of teaching- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.

Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture, 
furniture design, textiles and color is also desirable.

In all "degree" courses in interior design a number of "academic" 
or "general studies" courses are included. It is only fair 
to demand that teachers of courses in English, history, psychology 
and so on be as well informed in matters of art, especially interior 
design, as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects. The 
proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only 
if this standard is observed. The matter of sympathy of the academic 
professors for art objectives also must be taken into account. 
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here. For 
proper accreditation of schools, teachers in any course must have 
a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate. 
Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate 
work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed. 
Indeed, it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable 
schools of art have granted degrees at all. The question, however, 
cannot be ignored for long. The basic problem involved is that a college 
setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty 
for the advanced degree. Most professors in the course must, naturally, 
again have a higher degree than the course offers. One solution 
is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute. 
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy and you solve it. 
This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general. 
Only the independent art schools, that is, those not connected 
with any university or college, receive severe and separate investigation 
before accreditation by the various regional organizations. It has 
been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation 
for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of 
their fine arts department. This, plus the habit of many schools of 
simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics 
department, yet, nevertheless, claiming that they teach interior 
design, has contributed to the low repute of many university courses 
in interior design. In spite of this, many universities offer adequate 
and even distinguished courses in the subject.   There will be 
no mitigation of these offences until all art schools, whether independent 
or attached to universities have separate accreditation- as do 
medical schools- by an art accreditation group such as the "National 
Association of Schools of Art".   Independent art schools 
granting degrees must, naturally, follow this with academic accreditation 
by the appropriate regional group. 

#GENERAL#

How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives 
of your benefit and service program? Have you permitted it to become 
a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee 
morale and, consequently, increased productivity?   What 
effort do you make to assess results of your program? Do you measure 
its relation to reduced absenteeism, turnover, accidents, and grievances, 
and to improved quality and output?   Have you set specific 
objectives for your employee publication? Is it reaching these 
goals? Is it larger or fancier than you really need? Are you using 
the most economical printing methods, paper, etc&. Are there other, 
cheaper communications techniques that could be substituted?

Has your attitude toward employee benefits encouraged an excess 
of free "government" work in your plant?   Is your purchasing 
agent offering too much free-buying service for employees?

When improvements are recommended in working conditions- such as 
lighting, rest rooms, eating facilities, air-conditioning- do you try 
to set a measure of their effectiveness on productivity?   When 
negotiating with your union, do you make sure employees have a choice 
between new benefits and their cents-per-hour cost in wages.

Can you consider restricting any additional employee benefits to those 
paid for by profit-sharing money, such as was done in the union contract 
recently signed by American Motors Corporation? 

#INSURANCE# 

Do your employees understand all the benefits to which your insurance 
entitles them? Are they encouraged to take full legal advantage 
of these benefits? Have you publicized the cents-per-hour value 
of the company's share of insurance premiums?   When did you 
last compare your present premium costs with the costs of insurance 
from other sources?   Can your insurance company aid you in reducing 
administrative costs?   Do you try to maintain the principle 
of employee-contributed (as opposed to fully company-paid) programs? 

#HOLIDAYS, TIME OFF, OVERTIME#

Do you protect your holiday 
privileges with an attendance requirement both before and after the holiday?

Do you plan to limit additional holidays to area and/or 
industrial patterns?   Have you investigated the possibility 
of moving midweek holidays forward to Monday or back to Friday in 
order to have an uninterrupted work week?   Are you carefully 
policing wash-up time and rest periods to be certain that all other time 
is productive?   Are you watching work schedules for boiler 
operators, guards, and other 24-hour-day, 7-day-week operations in order 
to minimize overtime?   Are you careful to restrict the number 
of people on leave at one time so that your total employment obligation 
is minimized? 

#PLANT FEEDING FACILITIES#

Have you considered 
using vending equipment to replace or reduce the number of cafeteria 
employees?   What are the possibilities for operating your 
cafeteria for a single shift only and relying upon vending machines 
or prepackaged sandwiches for the second- and third-shift operations?

Have you checked the cost of subcontracting your cafeteria 
operation in order to save administrative costs?   Are there 
possibilities of having cafeteria help work part-time on custodial or 
other jobs?   Can staggered lunch periods relieve the capacity 
strain on your feeding facilities?   Would it be feasible to 
limit the menu in order to reduce feeding costs?   Have you considered 
gradual withdrawal of subsidies to your in-plant feeding operation?

Are you utilizing cafeteria space for company meetings 
or discussions? 

#RECREATION FACILITIES#

Are your expenses in 
this area commensurate with the number of employees who benefit from 
your program?   Have you audited your program recently to weed 
out those phases that draw least participation?   Do employees 
contribute their share of money to recreational facilities? 
Have you considered delegating operational responsibility to your employee 
association and carefully restricting your plant's financial 
contribution?   Could an employee's garden club take over partial 
care of plant grounds? Would a camera club be useful in taking 
pictures pertinent to plant safety?   Are you spending too much 
money on team uniforms that benefit only a few employees? Are you 
underwriting expensive team trips?   Are you utilizing vending 
machine proceeds to help pay for your program? 

#TRANSPORTATION 
AND PARKING#

Do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access 
roads and parking lots?   If you use parking attendants, can 
they be replaced by automatic parking gates?   Will your local 
bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant?

If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this be replaced 
by available public transportation? If you use company transportation 
to meet trains or to haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?

How efficient and necessary are your intra-company vehicles? Can 
they be re-scheduled? Can part-time drivers be assigned to other 
productive work? 

#PAID VACATIONS#

Which is more economical for 
your plant- a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra 
employees for vacation fill-ins?   Can vacations be spaced 
throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?

Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations 
during plant shutdowns?   What can your sales and purchasing 
departments do to curtail orders, shipments, and receipts during vacation 
shutdown periods? 

#RETIREMENT#

Is an arbitrary retirement 
age of 65 actually costing your plant money?   What sort of 
effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully 
productive? Would early retirement of non-productive, disabled employees 
reduce the number of make-work jobs?   Will your union 
accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees? 

#MEDICAL AND HEALTH#

Can you share medical facilities 
and staff with neighboring plants?   If you have a full-time 
doctor now, can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves 
on a fee-per-case basis only?   Can your plant nurse be replaced 
by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment?

Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected 
health problems and avoid treating the latter?   Are 
you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services- flu shots, 
sun lamp treatments, etc&?   If you have an annual or regular 
physical examination program, is it worth what it is costing you? 

#A PROGRAM TO FIT YOUR NEEDS#

Consider what you can afford 
to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee 
benefit program. Too many plant officials are all too eager to 
buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works 
for another plant.   But even if that other plant employs the 
same number of workers and makes the same product, there are other facts 
to consider. How old is your working force? What's your profit 
margin? In what section of the country are you located? Are 
you in a rural or urban area? These factors can make the difference 
between waste and efficiency in any benefit program.   Above all, 
don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good 
will. Unions stress fringe benefits, but the individual hourly worker 
prefers cash every time.   Aim to balance your employee benefit 
package. Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe- say a liberal 
retirement plan- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere. They're 
asking for union trouble. 

#COMMUNICATIONS#

If you want credit 
for your employee services program, let your workers know what they're 
entitled to. Encourage them to exercise their benefits. This 
can be done by stories in your house organs, posters, special 
publications, letters to workers' homes as well as 
by word of mouth through your chain of command.   Some companies 
find a little imagination helpful. Hallmark Cards, Inc&, Kansas 
City, Mo&, has a do-it-yourself quiz game called "Benefit Bafflers", 
which it distributes to employees. ~M + ~R Dietetic Laboratories, 
Inc&, Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook- 
each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular 
fringe. U& S& Rubber Company, New York, passes out a form 
itemizing the value of benefits. The blue-collar worker thus knows 
his insurance package, for example, costs $227.72. 

#INSURANCE#

Have 
the insurance company or your own accounting department break down 
the cost of your insurance package periodically. You may find certain 
coverage costing much more than is economically feasible, thereby alerting 
you to desirable revisions.   Check to see if some of your 
benefits- such as on-the-job disability pay- can be put on a direct 
payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you. 
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible. It can put an end to marginal 
claims which play havoc with your insurance rates. Also, beware 
of open-end policies, especially in the medical field. This will mean 
that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will 
go up in like manner. Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits.

Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death. 
Generally, your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that 
protect him during his working life or during retirement. 

#SPECIAL TIME 
OFF#

In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off 
and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify. 
Thus, you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth 
cousin's funeral. Also, reserve the right to demand proof of 
death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it.   Coffee 
breaks can be a real headache if not regulated. Vending machines 
can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting 
waste of production time. If coffee is sold at the cafeteria, 
let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group. Consider 
installing supplemental serving lines in production areas. Make 
sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers, 
if you are supplying the coffee. Otherwise, you may be saddled 
with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers. 

#RETIREMENT POLICIES# 

Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool 
and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company. 
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest 
possible age. Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements 
tied into your pension plan. Younger men usually don't think 
of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're 
liable to change jobs several times before settling down.   Choose 
carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans. 
There are two sides of a coin for this decision. Workers usually think 
more of a plan they contribute to. And they can at least collect 
the money they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company. A 
non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he 
retires. Thus, there is an added incentive to stay on the job. 

#HOLIDAYS# 

Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee 
would not otherwise be working. These include: leaves of absences, 
illnesses, and layoffs.   Consider adopting a system of holidays 
in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience 
to the operation of the plant. It's usually not too hard to sell 
workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods. For example, 
the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's 
birthday. This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and 
startups.   Require each employee to work his last shift both 
before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay. This cuts the absentee 
rate. 

#EATING FACILITIES#

Consider using vending machines 
rather than subsidized cafeterias. Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable 
prices, and at a profit to you. If a concessionaire runs the 
cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price. If the soup tastes 
like dishwater, your employees won't blame the concessionaire. You'll 
take the rap.   Check your cafeteria location to make sure 
it's convenient for most employees. You may save valuable production 
minutes with a change. 

#VACATIONS#

Spread your vacation period 
over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two 
weeks. This will cut the expense of vacation replacements. And with 
the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice 
vacation dates.   Also make sure you have reasonable requirements 
as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a 
vacation. You might try providing standard vacation time off but make 
the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous 
year. 
THE LONG and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into 
a new era. Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition. 
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away. But with 
all the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain- a few things remain 
constant, including the devotion of Americans to the great field 
sports, hunting and fishing.   As the generations move on, clothes 
become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports. Sporting 
firearms change, markedly for the better. Just as modern transportation 
has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon, the demand of 
today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.

The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through 
diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle 
loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders, 
extremely accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms. And 
millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition, 
designed for today's hunting and target shooting.   And due 
to modern resource-use and game management practices, there is still 
game to shoot, even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and 
water. Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not as an expendable 
natural resource, but as an annual harvest to be sown and also 
reaped. Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states, 
on shooting preserves (one of the newer phases of modern game-management) 
for five and six months each year.   Close to two million 
game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting 
preserves, and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas 
during the 1960-61 season. The shooting development program of the 
Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully 
published these facts in all major outdoor magazines, many national 
weeklies and the trade papers.   The most effective way to 
develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly 
managed shooting preserves. This has been the aim of the director 
of the shooting development program, the New York staff of the Sportsmen's 
Service Bureau, and the ~SAAMI shooting preserve 
field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.   Following 
the kick-off of ~SAAMI's shooting development program 
in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place in Washington, D& C&. 
The group known as the American Association for Health, Physical 
Education, and Recreation (a division of the National Education 
Association) initiated a conference which brought together representatives 
of the National Rifle Association, ~SAAMI and the American 
Fishing Tackle Manufacturers. This meeting was called to 
determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as 
the Outdoor Education Project.   The Outdoor Education Project 
took cognizance of the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic 
activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship 
to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life. The 
various team sports assuredly have their place in every school, and 
they are important to proper physical development. But with the exception 
of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical education 
activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of 
the average American man or woman.   Following a vigorous campaign 
of interpretation and leadership development by ~OEP director 
Dr& Julian Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges 
and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical 
education and recreation programs. ~SAAMI's financial support 
since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education. 
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have 
proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops, at which 
hundreds of school administrators, teachers, professors, and recreational 
leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education. Considering 
that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths, the project 
and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more 
to reach.   In 1959 ~SAAMI's shooting development program 
announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys 
and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in 
the shooting sports. This program is now nationally known as "Teen 
Hunter Clubs".   Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored 
by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation. 
The first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss, Hempstead, New 
York, under the direction of Special Events director Jennings 
Dennis. Other pilot programs were conducted by ~A + ~S, Babylon, 
New York; J& L& Hudson, Detroit; Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.

Other ~THC activities followed, conducted by shopping 
centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers, radio-~TV 
stations, newspapers, and other organizations interested in the 
need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting 
firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations 
related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources. ~SAAMI's 
field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 
75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic 
young Americans.   Through the efforts of ~SAAMI's 
shooting development program these shooting activities, and many 
others, including assists in the development of public and privately 
financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues, rifle and pistol marksmanship 
programs have been promoted, to mention only a few.   The 
continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will 
assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made 
aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities 
for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand. While individual 
sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of our political, 
social, educational and even religious leaders too often forget it. Help 
is needed from dealers, at the grass-roots level.   The American 
gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program 
through their industry trade association. Since ~SAAMI's 
conception in 1926, and more specifically since the adoption of the 
Shooting Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and promotional 
man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot 
for more youths and adults. We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition 
dealer, have benefited through additional sales of equipment.

Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports? Are you looking 
ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and 
girls, who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life- 
ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent 
ammunition?   <Is your 
sporting firearms and ammunition department 
primed for the expanding horizons?>   Would you like to 
organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting programs, and have information 
on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags 
on shooting preserves? Ask Sammy Shooter. 
WE WERE CAMPING a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in 
that land of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's 
famed Outer Banks. This beach campground with no trees or hills presents 
a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual 
use.   With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety 
of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now. There were 
umbrella tents, wall tents, cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup 
tents, Pop tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper trailers, 
travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes serving as 
sunshades over entire family camps.   Moving around camp we saw 
all kinds of camp stoves, lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle, 
windbreaks and sunshades. We saw similar displays in the other 
three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long National Seashore Recreation 
Area. Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often, look 
at the equipment and talk with the campers. Here you begin to appreciate 
the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.

Camping is big and getting bigger. No one knows where it will 
stop. Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement 
of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of 
all outdoor markets. You read various guesses on how many Americans 
are camping. The number depends on who is talking at the moment. The 
figures range as high as 15 million families. I've heard 10 million 
mentioned often, but I'm more inclined to think there may be a 
total of some five to seven million families camping. Seven million families 
would total 30 million Americans or more. Consider the equipment 
needed to protect this many from the weather, to make their cooking 
easy and their sleeping comfortable. 

#MORE CAMPERS THAN CAMPSITES# 

Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they 
know what to do with. They are struggling to meet the demand for camping 
space, but families are being turned away, especially on holiday 
weekends. The National Parks, always popular camping places, are facing 
the same pressure. The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to 
have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day- almost 
twice what there are at present. The U& S& Forest Service cares 
for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests 
and is increasing its facilities steadily.   But the campers still 
come. They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding. 
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits. 
They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing 
numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation 
that becomes a family experience of lasting importance. 

#WHY THEY 
KEEP COMING#

There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for 
the migration to the campgrounds. Among them, according to the U& 
S& Department of Commerce, are: (1) shorter work weeks, (2) 
higher pay, (3) longer paid vacations, (4) better transportation, (5) 
earlier retirement, and (6) more education. The more people learn about 
their country, the more they want to learn. Camping is family fun, 
and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever 
saw before.   But make no mistake about it, the first reason 
people turn to camping is one of economy. Here is the promise of a vacation 
trip they can afford.   The American Automobile Association, 
computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes 
up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29. The ~AAA 
then splits it down this way: $10.50 for meals, $9.50 for lodging, 
$7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.   What does 
the camping couple do to this set of figures? The $9.50 for lodging 
they save. Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in 
their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most 
of the tip money. The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing 
cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping 
along the way.   Where Americans used to think of a single 
vacation each summer, they now think about how many vacations they 
can have. Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or 
four days several times a year. And even if they stay in resorts part 
of the time, they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow, develop 
a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip 
into the wide open spaces.   It would be a mistake to sell those 
thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts 
of home. They're not. Home is the place to find the comforts of 
home. They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences. But 
it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable 
camping has become. This is no longer a way of life for the bearded 
logger and the wandering cowboy. Today's campers want comforts, and 
they have them. And this helps explain why so many people are now going 
camping. It's fun, and it's easy- so easy that there is time 
left after cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out and 
enjoy outdoor fun with their families.   Camp meals are no great 
problem. Neither are beds, thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags. 
Neither are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs of every 
camper or prospective camper.   But there is still the sometimes 
complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for 
their individual needs. 
@ Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance has become 
the commander of others- for good or bad. Since the Industrial 
Revolution, when factories emerged, this classical pattern has been 
followed. {Until recently.}   There have always been tales 
of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator, 
willingly or not, and found he didn't like it; the scientist 
who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more 
commonly in recent years, the engineer who found that other duties interfered 
with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions. {There 
have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into 
very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work, to their own and 
the public's dissatisfaction and loss.}   This has been more 
evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased 
technology. The remedies have been many and varied- attempts to 
teach management techniques- either in plant, at special schools, 
or 
in university "crash" courses- provision of management-trained assistants 
or associates. {But the realization has been growing that 
these are not the complete answer.} Some men have no talent for or 
interest in management; forcing them into management can only create 
trouble. The old shop adage still holds: "A good mechanic is usually 
a bad boss".   Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition 
of managerial status as the gage of success. Labor fights to 
change its collar from blue to white. All grades of management seek 
more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures. As several 
recent books have over-emphasized, {we have become the most status-conscious 
nation in the world.}   {What can be done for 
the "individual contributor"} who is extremely important- and 
likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented 
company? He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and 
outside; usually concerned about America's belief that attainment 
and success are measured in dollars and titles. Yet titles are traditionally 
given only to management men, and income tends to rise with 
title.   Even the college professor in America has been affected. 
It is, as one engineer says, "indeed a difficult thing for the 
engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he 
could employing managerial skills. This difficulty arises even though 
we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course. This 
leads one to conclude, as you have, that there is inevitably more 
prestige in a management position in the minds of our people".

Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than 
engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers. So we asked such 
men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on 
the "dual-road-up" problem- and more importantly- their solutions. 
In the paragraphs that follow, we quote from 32 men who are identified 
on the final page. 

#FIRST: WHAT TITLE, WHAT SETUP?#

Among 
the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of 
General Electric. {This is not a mutually exclusive plan; there 
is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the 
technical or the managerial path upward. Further, the management path 
does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by 
the more technical path. It is common to shift back and forth, working 
up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.}

Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor 
positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide "services" 
operation that are filled by men with successful managerial 
experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.   Also, 
moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's 
recognition as a technical expert. As examples at ~GE: Glen 
B& Warren, formerly manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized 
as a turbine designer. The late W& R& G& Baker, a pioneer 
in television design and long-time ~vp + ~gm of the Electronics 
Division, and later, by his own choice, an individual consultant. 
Harold E& Strang, expert in switchgear design, for a long period 
~vp + ~gm of the Measurements + Industrial Products Division, 
and who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president and consulting 
engineer in the Switchgear + Control Division.   In 
the ~GE plan, a number of individual contributors have positions 
and compensation higher than those of many managers. These positions 
carry such titles as:   Consultant- Advanced Development

Consulting Engineer   Consulting Engineer- Heat Transfer

Consulting Electrical Engineer   Senior Electrical 
Engineer   Senior Physicist   Westinghouse has a similar 
system, with two classifications representing various levels of competence 
on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist, 
as the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist. Many 
companies have systems, particularly in ~R + ~D, which work more 
or less well, depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on 
the part of administration, as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent 
quotations.   Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel 
recognition is, as one man says it: "**h that the fad for educating 
top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically 
trained approach". _SENIOR STAFF ENGINEER?_ One company instituted, 
early in 1959, a vertical classification system consisting of four 
levels. There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks; 
the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer, enjoys status 
and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision. 
The second level, senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level 
supervision. The expectation is that first-level supervisors will 
be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third 
engineering level, with very few coming from the first level.

The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for 
non-supervisory engineers, but probably not into executive levels. 
{In this organization, about half of the engineers with 15 or more 
years of employment are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere.} This 
reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which 
are not military. Several other examples: _CENTRAL AND SATELLITE_ 
"We have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering 
department headed by a chief engineer. We have set up a central ~R 
+ ~D department, as well as engineering-management departments- 
about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants. 
A separate research department is, of course, confined to new or future 
designs. Part of this headquarters staff, however, are engineering 
managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters 
management. These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president- 
Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers and chief 
engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are 
engineers who have been advanced from the divisions. These men are 
considered managers of engineers. They must learn to wear several hats, 
so to speak, working with management, sales and engineering problems 
related to the product.   "We do not have people in our organization 
termed 'consultants' or 'fellows', who are specialists 
in one particular technical subject. I suppose it is because we are 
just not big enough. We have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers 
retained and called in on certain problems. The only 'fellows' 
in our company are those who have been honored by ~ASME, ~AIEE 
or ~AIChE **h I am sure that the engineer who enters 
management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities 
than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider 
accountability". 

_ANOTHER STRUCTURE_ "We have tried to make both 
paths attractive, so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction 
in either. One way to formalize this is in the job structure. 
We have these positions, which compare directly: **f   "Above 
these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president 
of ~Engrg, ~R + ~D. The latter jobs include major management 
responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily 
through the engineering-management side **h {We have not yet 
succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable 
to our higher levels of management, but I believe we will trend 
in this direction} **h but not to exceed vice-president". _TOP 
JOB: RESEARCH SCIENTIST_ "Approximately four years ago, we 
initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons **h The 
highest position is known as a 'research scientist'. This approach 
has not been entirely satisfactory. The primary deterrent appears to 
lie with the technical people themselves, and their concept of what 
constitutes status in present-day society. {Scientists who agitate 
hardest 
for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept 
it **h We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private 
offices and private secretaries are extremely important;} and although 
we have attempted to provide these status symbols, support of the 
'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted **h despite the creation 
of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that 
of men in top managerial positions.   {"A serious problem 
accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly 
defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.} 
With no set standards, there is the tendency to promote to the 
next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless 
of performance **h {promotion is too often based on longevity and 
time in salary grade instead of merit.} If no specific organization 
plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level, 
the result is a department top-heavy with high-level, high-salaried personnel". 
_STAFF ENGINEER @ DEPT MANAGER_ "We have two approaches 
for the technical man: the position of staff engineer, which 
is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative 
organization to take the routine load away from department managers 
and project engineers as much as possible, thus allowing them more time 
for strictly technical work. These are only halfway measures, and 
the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man 
in industry **h to progress without limit in salary and prestige". 
_A COMPLETE PLAN_ "We have made limited application of the 'parallel 
ladder' plan. The highest rated non-supervisory engineering 
title is 'research engineer'. The salary schedule permits remuneration 
greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering 
supervision (engineering section head). We also have an 'engineering 
section head- research engineer' classification which has salary 
possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer. Above this 
point there is no generally used parallel ladder.   "We also 
do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a 
'professional' 
and also to give public recognition to individual technical 
competence. {These include encouragement of, and assistance 
to, the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers. 
We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity, a magazine 
widely distributed both within and without the company, and an 
information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes 
of all engineers.} Publicity is given to the award of patents to 
our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership 
in technical societies.   "A recent, and more pertinent action, 
has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the 
vice-president for Engineering. This function is staffed by engineers 
chosen for their technical competence and who have the title, member 
of the technical staff'. Salaries compare favorably with those paid 
to the first two or three levels of management. Additional symbols 
of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive badge passes 
authorizing special privileges, and a difference in the treatment 
of financial progress through merit.   "We presently are involved 
in inaugurating a new development center. Operations of this nature 
offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status. All scientific 
staff members will have the title, 'research-staff member'. 
The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the 
scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific 
field. Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations, 
the position to which research-staff members report administratively will 
not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member, 
therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as highly.   "These 
recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number 
of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence. It 
is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result 
entirely from company efforts. Fundamental to the difficulty of creating 
the desired prestige is the fact that, in the business community, 
prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that 
one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in 
the management functions".

SIXTY MILES NORTH of New York City where the wooded hills 
of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there 
is a new home development called "Oakwood Heights". As a matter 
of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated 
county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages 
in the $14,000 range. But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular 
**h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line 
that starts at a central storage point.   This is a pilot operation 
sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State 
Pipeline Corporation, with principal offices in New York State. 
Its president is Otis M& Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen 
+ Waters, 5404 Chrysler Bldg&, New York City. Vice-president 
is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter. 
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft 
Distributors, Inc&, Newburgh, N&Y&.   The idea 
of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty. 
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U& S& 
and Canada, even overseas, write to FUELOIL + OIL HEAT to inquire 
if it's feasible and where it is being done. Its editors only 
knew of one example to point to, a public housing development of 278 
homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue. 
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern 
among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered. Rather 
the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis 
of number of rooms and persons in the family.   Common complaints 
included "Mrs& Murphy" leaving her windows open all the time, 
a fresh air fan, or the family was visiting "Aunt Minnie" with 
the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil. As a 
result of that attitude, others have been discouraged from trying central 
distribution.   A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks 
the situation at Oakwood Heights. Called a "Slo-Flo" meter 
it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles, 
a key individual being Don Nelson. Tri-State has acquired 
its exclusive distribution for the northern, principal heating states.

There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed 
by a lawyer. The earlier New Haven development was public housing, 
so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture. These 
have to do with property rights, municipal official attitudes and 
a host of others. In working out the practical legal conclusions President 
Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project, for it is 
planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments 
nationally.   It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming, 
to get approval of any kind of line under a public street, as one 
example. To overcome this, the builder lays and completes the street 
himself, then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual 
easement for the oil lines. When a family buys a home the title is subject 
to a perpetual easement to Tri-State. For the central storage, 
Tri-State buys one acre, Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent 
title to that piece. In other words, the whole storage and pipeline 
system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather 
to Tri-State.   How does Tri-State get its revenue from this 
plan? It leases the whole facility to a large oil company, at least 
large enough to have a strong credit position. This first test is 
being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 
15 years. The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use 
of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all 
the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable 
to both parties.   On this first venture the central storage is 
20,000 gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons for each of 
the 50 homes. The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport 
loads, so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather 
contingencies. However, that is not all he has to do. He must 
undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine 
heating. In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water 
form Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot 
water hookups. Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals 
as he finds best.   For this first development the supplier 
signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being 
transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor. The major 
gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor 
apparently can do well because delivery cost is low. 

#INITIAL 
CONSIDERATIONS#

The officers of the new corporation have naturally 
explored many angles, as well as personalities that might be affected. 
For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie town (township) where the 
project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow 
clearing problem. The central storage is near a main artery quite 
easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing, with fewer 
trucks in the residential streets.   The Public Service Commission 
has ruled that this is not a public utility, subject to 
their 
many regulations.   Several financial institutions, both banks 
and insurance companies, have been sounded out. They like it and would 
supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong 
oil companies.   The Government housing agencies consider it 
feasible with one special stipulation. There must be a restriction in 
the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the 
current market price for the oil **h an obvious precaution, since the 
account is permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.

For a few details of the system **h the lines are 1-1/4'' 
<X-Tru-Coat,> a product of Republic Steel Corp&, and all lines 
are welded. They are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some 
areas four feet down, particularly under roads, to stay clear of all 
other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy 
trucking. The meter is mounted high on the basement wall. Its figures 
are a half inch high and very easy to read, even into tenth gallons. 
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.

Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total cost of all the 
heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than 
would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters. 
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder 
developments where gas is available.   It would be pretty 
difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods, and that's 
an understatement. The job of getting property easements and street 
easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging. 
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch 
the solutions are simple. 

#FUTURE PLANS#

What does Tri-State actually 
want to do, now that it has the meters under franchise and certain 
phases of its piping system in the "patent applied for" stage? 
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including 
its facility in their new home projects, by financing and installing 
the storage, piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years, 
with renewal options, to a strong oil company. It may also work in one 
other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters, 
letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.

This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers, 
for the idea has so often been mentioned, somewhat wistfully. 
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights. Only eight of 
the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on 
June 8th; others were building. The big tanks were at the site but 
still sunning themselves. A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches, 
and the town building inspector was paying a friendly, if curious, 
visit.   The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a revival 
of research and development. A primary ingredient in these fields 
is imagination, and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a 
very good mark.

EVERY YEAR about this time National Gargle Your Cooling 
System week rolls around. It pays in the long (hot) run to take good 
care of the water works. Do it this way for the summer gargle:

@ First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer. Don't 
save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive "permanent" type. 
The word means it won't boil away easily, nothing else. The rust 
inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year, and you don't want 
to risk the rust that two years' use could mean. Pitch it out.

@ If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good flushing cleaner.

@ Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor. Of 
course, you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.

@ Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections, 
around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals and heater 
fittings.   @ Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat 
opens, and then look for leaks again. Be sure the bugs and 
dirt are blown out of the radiator fins. Use the air hose for this job. 
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.   If you 
use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as "Dowguard" 
be sure to check it. Dow says that the fluid can be used now 
for two years. Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in 
during the summer.   Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid 
those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms 
this summer.   {Don't let your mechanics} pull the thermostats 
out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours. 
Spring and summer may be here officially, but those thermos stay 
in.   The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from 
any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase the fuel consumption, 
reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation 
of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.   If you 
run into excess plug fouling on one truck, check to be sure that the rig 
has a thermostat. The thermostat is important to get your engine up 
to operating temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its most 
efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.

{Are you paying too much} for your truck insurance? There's 
a good chance you are doubling on some coverage, not taking discounts 
coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.

Have a talk with your insurance agent. Be careful that you keep 
adequate coverage, but look for places to save money. First go over the 
type of coverage you now have. Look for these features which may mean 
you can save:   @ Duplicate coverage. Avoid doubling up 
on the same item. For example, don't pay in a truck policy for medical 
coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.

@ Does your policy have a lay-up clause? This means that 
if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days, insurance 
can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to 
you. This applies to repair work or winter storage.   The figure 
five is important in insurance. With many company policies you get 
a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs. This means either cars 
or trucks. Discounts run up to 2% of cost.   Usually premium 
reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability 
plan. For example: If your bodily injury claims start payment after 
the first $250, a 25% premium saving is often made. 
{I}n the period since the end of World War /2,- a period 
coinciding 
with merchandising demands for the colorful, the unusual, and the original 
in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that 
today 
they are the acknowledged leaders in the field. The importance of the 
sign industry to the plastics industry, however, is not in terms of 
volume alone. Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing 
approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings 
of other industries. Many of today's developments in thermoforming 
stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of 
preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers; 
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons, 
medallions, etc&, owes much to the field, as does the technology 
of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent 
plastics.   There is much that many industries can continue to 
learn from some of the more recent developments described below. The 
concept of trans-illumination (as shown by the photo on p& 92), as just 
one example, offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems- 
no matter what industry is involved. 

#A VOLUME MARKET#

According 
to a recent <Wall Street Journal> survey, plastics units now 
account for more than 50% of all sign sales. Five years ago, they had 
only 10% of the market, with the remainder firmly entrenched in the 
stronghold of neon tubing. And it's far from the end for plastics. 
Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during 
the 1960's will be of plastic construction. Evidence of this 
trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies 
in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&. 
Four years ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon 
signs; today, 85% is in plastics.   From the volume standpoint, 
the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive. Aggregate 
sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million. Currently, 
there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging from small firms 
with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities 
for production of metal, electrical, and plastic components. 

#WHY 
THE TREND TO PLASTICS?#

What accounts for the rapid growth 
of plastics in the sign and display field? Out of many factors which 
might be cited, five are most important: _1._ Plastics combine 
such properties as built-in color, light weight, optional transparency 
or translucency, resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication. 
_2._ Plastic signs are economical. According to one 
major producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 
25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit. Shipping cost is 
also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft& plastic sign weighs about 120 lb&, 
compared to 275-300 lb& for neon. The weight advantage, plus greater 
durability of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth 
in shipping. The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings 
are needed. Finally, maintenance costs on plastic signs are 
much lower than on fragile neon signs. _3._ They offer exceptional 
design freedom, making it 
possible to incorporate contours and details 
which give free range to the talents of the designer. Vacuum- and pressure-formed 
sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded 
plastics. Pre-decoration, 
low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large 
and small, thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the 
industry. _4._ Plastics signs work around the clock. Internal 
illumination, protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual 
appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command 
attention and interest. _5._ Advances in equipment and fabrication 
techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide 
choice of production techniques, ranging from injection molding for 
intricate, smaller-size, mass-production signs (generally 5000 units is 
the minimum) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited 
runs. Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field 
are expandable styrene molding and blow molding. _WHAT PLASTICS 
TO USE?_ For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its outstanding 
optical characteristics, weather resistance and formability, strongly 
dominates the picture. At present, both the familiar cast acrylic 
and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers, 
with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total. (See 
panel, p& 166, for a comparison.)   Of interest is a recent 
announcement by Du Pont's 
Polychemicals Dept& of a new methyl methacrylate 
monomer designated as Monocite ~H 100, which was developed 
specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and 
lighting industry. Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs 
only one-third as much as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather, 
and will not yellow. Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures, 
resists chipping, cracking, and crazing, according to Du Pont.

Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed 
signs, background panels, and molded or formed letters because of its 
exceptional toughness, ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties. 
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important 
factors. New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which 
the two sheets of the laminate are of different color. Thermoforming 
the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical 
way to produce a two-color sign. (see ~MPl, Mar& 1961, 
p& 
98).   For specialized types of displays, such as large three-dimensional 
units reproducing a product, package, human or animal figures, 
etc&, reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols 
are other materials frequently used.   A relative newcomer 
in 
outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film, now used as a printed overlay 
for trans-illuminated signs (see below).   For outdoor signs and 
displays, where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a 
factor, the choice of plastics is almost unlimited. Here may be found 
regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate and 
cellulose propionate, acrylic, vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene. 
The final choice of material depends upon such factors as 
costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity, number of units 
required, time available for tooling, and projected life expectancy of 
the unit. Often, the finished sign or display incorporates several types 
of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques. 

#TRANS-ILLUMINATED 
BILLBOARDS#

One of the most significant advancements in design 
of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard, now 
being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance 
Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, and Industrial Electric Inc&, 
New Orleans, La&.   The essential difference between the new 
trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former, 
constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted from within. 
With the source of light behind the copy, there is no loss of lumen output, 
as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light. 
Also, the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure 
and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.   The copy itself, 
including any text or illustrations, is reproduced in full color directly 
on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process. The 
film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto 
the acrylic panels forming the sign, and also to be stripped off for 
replacement by new copy as required. Spare sets of face panels simplify 
the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged 
for the old right in the field on a single trip. Panels with 
outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.

Signs of this type have already made their appearance 
in several larger cities, and others are on the way. It is believed that 
these boards will, within the next few years, replace many of the 
conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.   Trans-illuminated 
signs also show versatility in other directions. As used by Industrial 
Electric Inc&, the film panels are printed one at a time, as 
are 24-sheet posters. Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent 
plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels 
for use on cutouts, or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin 
faces. In this way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying 
uniform copy on different sign media.   Recently Industrial 
Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern 
plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign. Comprised of 16 
triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible to 
combine three different signs in a single unit. The triangles automatically 
revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec& of viewing time for 
each poster subject. Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft& 
wide, make up the 25-ft& length of the sign. 

#CHANGEABLE LETTERS 
FILL MANY NEEDS#

Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility 
of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays 
would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this 
complex field- changeable signs.   Signs are meant to convey 
a message, and in most cases, this requires words and letters. Frequently, 
the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products, 
price changes, etc&. The huge market for changeable signs has spurred 
a universal demand for individual plastic letters, in all shapes 
and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them. Here 
are some of the newer items currently available:   Poster Products 
Inc&, Chicago, Ill&: a changeable copy and display 
sign 
which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of 
colors, onto which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words screened 
on acetate or other types of sheet stock. The background, which 
is available 
in various widths and continuous lengths, is extruded with 
parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.

The Adaptaplex Co&, Beaverton, Ore&; letters molded 
of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red or black. Ideal 
for merchandising use, they are weather-resistant, and have mounting 
pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern 
background panel.   For large letters, <e&g&> thermoformed 
of acrylic or butyrate, there are other techniques. For example, 
in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in& and six 36-in& red 
acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background. 
The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb& each made 
it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic 
angle brackets cemented to the letters. Stainless steel screws were 
used to minimize corrosion stains. For mounting to corrugated plastic 
backgrounds, very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters 
and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings, its ends 
twisted behind the panels.   Large injection-molded letters are 
also available for sign installations. Wagner Sign Service Inc&, 
Chicago, for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights of 
4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches. They are molded of a special weather-resistant 
formulation of Tenite butyrate. Also available from this company 
are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars, extruded of transparent acrylic material, 
which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material. 
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft&, the bars are shaped in cross 
section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back 
of the letters.   Still another approach to the changeable letter 
type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products, Azusa, 
Calif&. This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in& (or 
smaller) panels formed of 0.080-in& clear butyrate sheet stock, masked 
and sprayed on the rear side. Finished signs are produced by sliding 
the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in& aluminum, 
which may be mounted to various surfaces. The sheets are extruded of 
Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.

On large-area units, where additional structural requirements 
are imposed, one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed 
channels (<e&g&> right-angled corrugations) of the acrylic or butyrate. 
Joined side by side, such channels make possible construction 
of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft& high and 
of unlimited width. Letters may be wired to the face of the combined 
channels, painted on the first surface, or handled in other ways. 

#NEW RULE NO& 2: DON'T BUILD FROM THE OUTSIDE IN- TRY TO BUILD 
FROM 
THE INSIDE OUT#

Don't insert your components into fixed openings, 
they may or may not fit; position your components before you close 
them in. For example:   Don't wall in your kitchen before 
you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances. It's a lot quicker 
and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect 
the end wall after they are all in place.   Set your bathtub before 
you close in the end of the bathroom. Don't try to wrestle a 
400-~lb tub **f through a narrow doorway.   Finish your plumbing 
before you frame it in (most economical framing is a thin non-bearing 
partition on either side of the pipes).   Finish installing and 
connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them 
in. There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a 
furnace in a finished **f closet.   Don't position your studs 
before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way 
you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the 
window. You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows 
in one, two, three order- first the stud on one side, then the window, 
then the stud on the other side.   Install your disappearing 
stair (or stairs) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before 
you drywall the ceiling.   Don't close in your house until everything 
has been carried in. Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall 
between the house and garage. That way he can truck his parts right 
indoors and unload them under the roof.   No auto maker would 
dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons 
in the block. And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore 
most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds of dollars 
by always building from the inside out. 

#NEW RULE NO& 3 RETHINK 
EVERYTHING 
TO GET ALL THE BIG SAVINGS THE REVOLUTION IN MATERIALS HANDLING 
OFFERS YOU#

This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less 
news of all, because **h _1._ It makes it easy to handle much heavier 
units, so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated 
components like those shown in the pictures alongside. _2._ 
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that (like 
earthmoving and roadbuilding) should be lower today than in 1929. _3._ 
It changes the answers to "Who should do what, and where"? 
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases 
the chance for shop fabrication, where almost everything can be made 
better and cheaper. _4._ It changes the answers on when to do what 
at the site. For example, instead of putting in your driveways last 
(as many builders do) you can now save money by putting them in first. 
Instead of closing the house in first (as most builders do) you can 
now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to (<see 
~p 
121>). _5._ It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations. 
Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs 
by "buying direct" and short-cutting the dealer. But now many of 
these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming 
up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient 
specialized equipment 
to deliver everything just where it is needed- 
drywall inside the house, siding along the sides, trusses on the walls, 
roofing on the roof, etc&.   Says Clarence Thompson: "We 
dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder 
cheaper than he could do it himself". The revolution now under 
way in materials handling makes this much easier. _THE REVOLUTION 
IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE_ Five years ago 
a HOUSE + HOME Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' 
Research Council reported unhappily:   "Only one lumber 
dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car 
in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer 
in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder 
in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.   "So 
from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling 
(most of it inefficient) add up to one-fourth of the total construction 
cost of housing".   "That HOUSE + HOME Round Table 
was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials 
handling", says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' 
Research Council. "It made our whole industry recognize 
the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer, carrier, equipment 
maker, dealer, and builder, all working together to cut the cost 
of materials handling. Before that we lumber dealers were working 
almost single-handed on the problem". _HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND 
TODAY:_ _1._ Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater 
primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new 
houses are mechanized. There are few areas left where a builder cannot 
find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything 
at lower cost just where his workmen will need it. _2._ Practically 
all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized 
or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber, asphalt 
shingles, glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard, gypsum 
wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation sheathing, floor tile, acoustical 
tile, plaster base, and asbestos shingles. _3._ Truck and 
materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to 
meet almost every homebuilding need. For some significant new items 
see the pictures. _4._ More than 50% of all lumber is unitized; 
an ~NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will 
strap their shipments for mechanized handling. Of these, 376 said they 
make no extra charge for strapping in standard units, because they 
save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost. 
Most of the others 
will swallow their 50@ to $3 charge rather than lose 
a good customer. "With a 15,500-~lb fork-lift, dealers can unload 
unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30@/~mbf compared 
with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time", says 
James Wright of ~NLRDA. _5._ Lumber dealers and lumber 
manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments- 
48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high (or six McCracken packets 
24'' wide by nominal 7'' high). These units make it easy to 
load as much as 48,000 ~bd ~ft (say 120,000 ~lb in a 50' box 
car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars. _6._ The 
railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' 
or wider for forklift unloading (a 21% increase while the total 
number of box cars was falling 6%) and by cutting their freight rates 
twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars. First was a 1958 cut 
of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 
~lb; later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast (still pending elsewhere) 
of 7@/~cwt on 70,000 ~lb-plus carloads (which works out to 
more than $4/~mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 
~lb). _7._ More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars, 
and ~NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 
6-~B floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5.4@/~mbf. 
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof 
paper. This costs from 75@ to $2.30/~mbf, but the cover can 
pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open. _THESE CARRIERS 
CUT HANDLING COSTS FOR THE DEALER- AND THE BUILDER_ Says ~NRLDA's 
James Wright: "Since 1958 carriers that move material 
from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes 
than any of the dealer's other equipment".   The reason: today's 
components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled 
by a truckdriver and a helper. So manufacturers have pioneered a new 
type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier. It cuts the lumber dealer's 
cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload 
it, and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction 
of the cost of hand unloading. and it helps the builder because it 
can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can deliver it to the best 
spot (in some cases, right on the roof or inside the house), and never 
takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.

Says Wright: "Our survey shows that one third of the 
retail 
dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling 
in the coming two years. And most of the gain will be in self-unloading 
vehicles". 

#NEW RULE NO& 4: RESTUDY WHAT YOUR MEN DO, 
TO HELP THEM WASTE LESS OF THE TIME YOU PAY FOR#

Half the manhours 
you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right, 
so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right 
time, or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots 
or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection, or you 
bought cheap materials that took too long to fit, or your workmen had 
to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.

Even "America's most efficient builder", Bob Schmitt 
of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a 
result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation 
by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works. Already 
this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 
170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.   Builder 
Eddie Carr of Washington, past president of ~NAHB, cut his bricklaying 
costs $150 a house by adopting the "~SCR masonry process" 
worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the Structural 
Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better 
work for less. A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand 
bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process, cut them another 
$7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot 100-brick 
packages. The ~SCR process, with its precision corner-posts, 
its precision guide lines, its working level scaffold, and its hand-level 
brick supply takes eight manhours to get set, but once ready 
it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day. See 
<page 156>.   One good way to cut your labor waste is to make 
sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew. Reports 
Jim Lendrum: "By studying men on the job, we found that two men- 
a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three. We 
found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall 
panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men 
don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper 
team. We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job, 
five men, not four, is the magic number".   No house was ever 
built that could not have been built better for less if the work had 
been better planned and the work better scheduled. 

#NEW RULE NO& 
5: DON'T WASTE ANY 10@-A-MINUTE TIME ON GREEN LUMBER TO SAVE 3@ 
A STUD#

This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a builder 
can commit.   Green lumber was all very well back in the days 
of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then 
shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum. But now that all production 
builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels, 
green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.   Green 
studs cost about 65@; dry studs cost less than 3@ more. So if 
a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste 
even 20 seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry 
stud.

There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to 
be alone. Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves, but away from the 
crowds and common happenstance. If you've travelled in Europe a 
time or two, it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone 
feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic. 
Following a guide, and gratefully so, is an excellent way to 
see all the important places when everything is strange and new. However, 
after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas, the 
places and forums, the churches and museums, the palaces and castles, 
and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe, you'll want to 
change your course and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market 
places.   The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital 
of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has 
at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour d'Argent. You 
can relive history and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest 
for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi, an ancient 
town in the heel of Italy's boot. And you don't meet the folks from 
home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time 
and tourists since the Middle Ages. Time stands still as you climb 
the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain 
slopes or wander through story-book towns, perched atop lofty crags, 
their faces turned to the sea. They've been there since the days 
of the Moors and the Saracens. And what better way to end a day 
than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's 
village on the Mediterranean?   An almost too-simple-to-be-true 
way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself 
behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.   For those 
who need or want and can afford another car, buying one and driving 
it on the grand tour, then shipping it home, is one popular plan for 
a do-it-yourself pilgrimage. Then, of course, there are those of us 
who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car. The answer 
to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one. 
It is that elemental.   Almost any travel agent will reserve 
a car for you. You can call one of the car rental services directly 
(Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others) and ask 
them to reserve a car of your choice, and some transportation lines 
offer this service as well. With few exceptions, your car will be waiting 
for you at dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you 
arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost. You can wait, of course, until 
you arrive in Europe before renting your car. The disadvantages 
to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models 
readily available or you may have to wait a few days or, during the busy 
tourist season, when cars are in great demand, you might find it fairly 
difficult to get a car at all. Since charges are relatively the 
same, reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of 
having one on tap when you want it.   For those who plan to travel 
to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer 
a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave 
it in another city, or even another country, when you are ready to 
return home. At some cities, this pick-up and delivery service is without 
additional charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning 
your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free delivery 
and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries.

International Touring Documents are usually provided 
with the car as are road maps and touring data. A valid American 
driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal, Spain, 
Yugoslavia and Eastern 
Europe. If you plan to visit any of these countries, 
you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you 
leave at a nominal fee- around $3.00. Your insurance, too, with 
most agencies, is provided with the car, covering comprehensive fire, 
theft, liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies 
in different countries. If you would feel happier with full collision 
insurance, there is a small additional charge, again varying from country 
to country and depending on the term of such insurance. The average 
charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day. 
The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as 50@ a day in 
Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece.   Rental fees 
are variable, too, throughout the countries of Europe. There are as 
many rates as there are countries and models of cars available. As in 
the United States, there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus 
a few cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops if the car 
is retained for a week. It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one 
days.   It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from 
80@ to 90@ for the equivalent of a United States gallon and 
while you might prefer a familiar Ford, Chevrolet or even a Cadillac, 
which are available in some countries, it is probably wiser to choose 
the smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five and 
even forty miles to the gallon.   Your choice of model will undoubtedly 
be governed by the number of people travelling in your group. 
With the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny sedans will 
seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage 
space for really economical transportation. There is a large variety 
of models to choose from in most countries, however, including 6-passenger 
sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that 
much greater than for the wee sedans.   The basic costs are generally 
pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you 
reserve your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages. 
There is the free intra-city "rent it here, leave it there" service, 
as an example, the free delivery and collection at the airport, dockside 
or your hotel, luggage racks, touring documents and information 
and other similar services. A little investigation by telephone or reading 
the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these 
pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits. The investigation 
will be well worth your time.   All model cars are not 
available in all countries. Quite naturally, there is a greater availability 
of those models which are manufactured within a specific country. 
If you would like to start your tour in Italy, where the rental 
fees are actually the lowest in Europe, Fiats in all sizes are available, 
as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models. If you wish to budget 
closely on transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries, 
one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus 3@ 
a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station 
Wagon, seating six, at just 
$1.10 a day and 10-1/2@ a kilometer. If you will be using your car 
more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the daily rates 
drop quite sharply to 86@ a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal 
30@ a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon. With six in the 
group, the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily 
fee.   In the majority of countries, however, the rates range from 
$3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 
and $8.00 a day for the larger, luxury European models, with the rate 
per kilometer driven starting at 3@ and going up as high as 12@. 
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries, yet 
not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate 
or rate per kilometer driven. The variations are not too great. Rates 
for American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about $8.00 a day 
up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible, but the rate per 
kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models. 
Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest 
in Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite high in Ireland.

If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a 
month, it might be wise for you to lease a car. The actual over-all 
cost, for the first month, will perhaps not be too much lower than the 
rental charges for the same period of time, but you will receive a new 
car. You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner, 
which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized 
dealers throughout Europe. Further, there is no mileage charge 
or mileage limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only the flat 
monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since 
the car is registered and insured individually for your trip. There is 
a fairly wide selection of models of English, German and French manufacture 
from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7, Citroe^n 
2 ~CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca 
Beaulieu. Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a 
car in Europe, but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical 
and satisfactory. After the first month, rates are considerably 
less, averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger 
models.   There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent 
cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan. For one thing, the driver 
usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes 
pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road. Then, 
too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on 
the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed 
up with them. Still there is a way for those who want to see some 
of the back country of Europe by car. The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven 
car. It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.

Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 
a day, but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger 
Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800. The big 
spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven, being governed by 
the rate at which gasoline is consumed. Since most European cars average 
more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars, it naturally 
follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less, 
but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize 
this, provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger 
limousine.   The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars 
vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for 
the drive-yourself cars. However, whether you arrange to have a European 
or American model, if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity 
in relation to the number of people in your party, your transportation 
expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger. 
This will include your helpful, English-speaking chauffeur and a 
drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day. If you drive greater 
distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface and will 
never discover the enchantment, fascination and beauty which lured 
you in the first place to explore the hinterlands. Of course, if you 
want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac 
limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have a memorable 
tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is not recommended unless you own 
a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.

In American romance, almost nothing rates higher than what the 
movie men have called "meeting cute"- that is, boy-meets-girl 
seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct 
and acute boredom. Just about the most enthralling real-life example 
of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga: 
reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts, but he said 
simultaneously, "I wish they were emeralds". Aside from the comico-romantico 
content here, a good linguist-anthropologist could readily 
pick up a few other facts, especially if he had a little more of the 
conversation to go on.   The way MacArthur said his line- if 
you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would 
probably have gone like this: **f Primary stresses on emeralds and 
wish; note pitch 3 (pretty high) on emeralds but with a slight degree 
of drawl, one degree of oversoftness **h. Conclusions: The people 
involved (and subsequent facts bear me out here) knew clearly the relative 
values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary and sentimental. 
And the drawling, oversoft voice of flirtation, though fairly overt, 
was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.   In 
other words, like automation machines designed to work in tandem, they 
shared the same programming, a mutual understanding not only of English 
words, but of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can 
change their meaning from black to white. At this point, unfortunately, 
romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider, 
if you can bear it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for 
some perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark to an Eskimo 
girl in Eskimo. To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just 
so much blubber. The point- quite simply- is this: words they 
might have had; but communication, no.   This basic principle, 
the first in a richly knotted bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr& Henry 
Lee Smith, Jr&, at the University of Buffalo, where he heads 
the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics. A 
brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an ingenious system of 
spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith 
began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls- a project 
considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about "a young 
rat named Arthur, who never could make up his mind". Later, he 
became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and 
the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute. 
It was there, in the course of trying to prepare new men for the "culture 
shock" they might encounter in remote overseas posts, that he 
first began to develop a system of charting the "norms of human communication".

To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always 
revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker- 
such things as geographical origin and/or history, socio-economic identity, 
education. It is only fairly recently, however, that linguists 
have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way 
that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure 
of human communication between two people. This, for obvious reasons, 
makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric 
interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been successfully used 
to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.

In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished 
colleague, George Trager (so austerely academic he sometimes 
fights his own evident charm), and a third man with the engaging name 
of Birdwhistell (Ray), agreed on some basic premises about the three-part 
process that makes communication: (1) words or language (2) paralanguage, 
a set of phenomena including laughing, weeping, voice breaks, 
and "tone" of voice, and (3) kinesics, the technical name for 
gestures, facial expressions, and body shifts- nodding or shaking the 
head, "talking" with one's hands, et cetera.   Smith's 
first workout with stresses, pitches, and junctures was based on mother, 
which spells, in our culture, a good deal more than bread alone. 
For example, if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there are 
certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother. 
The usual U&S& norm would be: **f Middle pitches, slight 
pause (juncture) before mother, slight rise at the end. The symbols 
of mother's status, here, are all usual for culture U&S&A&. 
Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: **f Note the 
drop to pitch 1 (the lowest) on mother with no rise at the end of the 
sentence; this is a "fade" ending, and what you have here is a 
downtalking style of speech, expressing something less than conventional 
respect for mother. Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie 
goes with: **f In other words, the way the speaker relates to mother 
is clearly indicated. And while the meaning of the words is not in 
this instance altered, the quality of communication in both the second 
and third examples is definitely impaired. An accompanying record 
of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a 
throaty 
rasp. With this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly 
thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling 
things about himself and, in the last two examples, revealing that 
he had departed from the customs of his culture.   The joint investigations 
of linguistics and psychiatry have established, in point 
of fact, that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words 
are involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling 
over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate 
to the rest of the world. Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic 
and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of 
interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions 
in new research and training. Some of the earliest recordings, 
made in the 1940's, demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately 
to anger and anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records 
of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if 
they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most 
skilled and sensitive experts. In a general way, psychiatrists were 
able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt- 
that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic, that such 
things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not 
necessarily by words.   At a minimum, recording- usually on tape, 
which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview 
alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored 
repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists. Newest 
to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have 
carried that minimum to a new level. By adding a systematic analysis 
with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews, they have supplied 
a new set of techniques for the therapist. Linguistic charting of 
the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs 
from expected norms. It flags such possible breakdowns of communication 
as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval, ambivalence 
or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and the disinclination to speak at 
all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.

Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the therapist, but 
orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical 
and socio-economic background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways 
of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably 
beefed up by the linguist. His esoteric chartings of the voice alert 
the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying 
psychological difficulties, making them apparent first to the 
therapist and eventually to the patient. In one now-historic first 
interview, 
for example, the transcript (reproduced from the book, <The 
First Five Minutes>) goes like this: **f The therapist's level 
tone is bland and neutral- he has, for example, avoided stressing 
"you", which would imply disapproval; or surprise, which would 
set the patient apart from other people. The patient, on the other 
hand, is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent, 
she reveals by the use of the triad, "irritable, tense, depressed", 
a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity 
with literary or scientific language (i&e&, she must have 
had at least a high-school education), and she is telling a story she 
has mentally rehearsed some time before. Then she catapults into "everything 
and everybody", putting particular violence on "everybody", 
indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that 
is, it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up 
to this point. Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention. 
He may then very well conclude that "everybody" is probably 
not the true target of her resentment. Immediately thereafter, the 
patient fractures her rehearsed story, veering into an oversoft, breathy, 
sloppily articulated, "I don't feel like talking right now".

Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent 
to the therapist that "everybody" truthfully refers to the woman's 
husband. She says later, but still within the opening five minutes, 
"I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death".

The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are 
all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain 
signals that she does not accept divorce. By saying "a<noth>er emotional 
death", she reveals that there has been a previous one, although 
she has not described it in words. This the therapist may pursue 
in 
later questioning. The phrase, "emotional death", interesting and, 
to a non-scientific mind, rather touching, suggests that this woman 
may have some flair for words, perhaps even something of the temperament 
regrettably called "creative".   Since the psychiatric interview, 
like any other interview, depends on communication, it is significant 
to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked 
skill and long experience. His own communication apparatus operated 
superbly, and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total 
lack of resemblance to the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of 
Dr& Blauberman. Interestingly enough- although none of the real-life 
therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman- 
when groups of them began playing back interviews, they discovered 
any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview 
techniques; almost everyone, on first hearing one of his own sessions 
on tape, expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.

Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped interviews 
by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact 
that, in the first five minutes of an initial interview, the patient 
often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him; 
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively 
or scientifically how to listen. Naturally, the patient does not say, 
"I hate my father", or "Sibling rivalry is what bugs me". 
What he <does> do 
is give himself away by communicating information over 
and above the words involved. Some of the classic indicators, as described 
by Drs& Pittenger, Hockett, and Danehy in <The First 
Five Minutes>, are these: _AMBIGUITY OF PRONOUNS:_ Stammering 
or repetition of <I, you, he, she>, et cetera may signal 
ambiguity 
or uncertainty. On the other hand significant facts may be concealed- 
<she> may mean <I>; or <everybody>, as it did with the tense 
and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to a specific person. 
The word that is <not> used can be as important as the word that 
<is> used; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives. 
When someone says, for example, "They took ~X rays to 
see that there was nothing wrong with me", it pays to consider how 
this statement would normally be made. (This patient, in actuality, 
was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the 
fact 
that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.) 
**h Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in Durrell's 
Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke of his wife, which 
is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.

@ She was just another freighter from the States, and she seemed 
as commonplace as her name. She was the <John Harvey,> one 
of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans, 
bombs, and bullets to the U&S& Fifteenth Air Force, to Field 
Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the 
boot of Italy in that early December of 1943.   The <John Harvey> 
arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic, on November 28th, 
making for Porto Nuovo, which, as the name indicates, was the ancient 
city's new and modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as 
she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone thought 
of the <John Harvey,> it was to observe that she was straddled by 
a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit 
the <John Harvey> would likely be blown up with her own ammo and 
whatever else it was that she carried.   Which was poison gas. 
##

It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
before the <John Harvey> could be loaded with 100 tons of 
mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront. For in a world 
as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas 
was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.   Throughout 
the early years of World War /2,, reports persisted that the 
Axis powers had used gas- Germany in Russia, Japan in China again. 
They were always denied. Influential people in America were warning 
the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by 
the Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so far as to 
urge our using it first. To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President 
Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August:

"From time to time since the present war began there have 
been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating 
use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices 
of warfare. I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our 
present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such 
terrible and inhumane weapons.   "However, evidence that the 
Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an 
intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety 
of sources.   "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the 
general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them, 
and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically 
that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such 
weapons unless they are first used by our enemies".   The 
following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave 
effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in 
southern Italy. Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming 
safety, but because of its proximity to airfields. Any retaliatory 
gas attack would be airborne. It would be made in three waves- the 
first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the 
third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.

So the vile cargo went into the hole of the <John Harvey>. A 
detachment 
of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under 
First Lt& Howard D& Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt& 
Thomas H& Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy 
was paramount. Only a few other people- very important people- knew 
of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No one else must 
know. Thus, in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that 
knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy 
at Bari.   It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was growing 
dark in Bari. It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German 
~Me-210 
plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit. Capt& 
A& B& Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very 
worried. He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning 
to the attack in Italy. On November 24th, they had made a raid on La 
Maddalena. Two days later, some 30 of them had struck at a convoy 
off Bougie, sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that 
the ~Me-210 had made its first appearance. After it had reappeared 
the next two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said:

"For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been 
over the city taking pictures. They're just waiting for the proper 
time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic".

But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist. 
Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now 
being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander 
who would conduct the "Little Blitz" on London in 1944, a 
major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered 
seriously. True, there had been raids on Naples- but Naples was 
pretty far north on the opposite coast. No, Bari was out of range. 
More than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth 
Army's sector. So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch 
the scouting plane put in five more appearances, and to feel the 
certainty of this dread rising within him. For Jenks knew that Bari's 
defenses were made of paper. The Royal Air Force had but a single 
light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available. There 
were no R&A&F& fighter squadrons on Bari airfield. The 
radar station with the best location was still not serviceable. Telephone 
communication was bad. And everywhere in evidence among the few 
remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple 
command.   It had been made shockingly evident that very morning 
to Ensign Kay K& Vesole, in charge of the armed guard aboard the 
<John Bascom>. A British officer had come aboard and told him 
that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs 
were actually dropped. Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a 
radar-controlled 
shore gun firing white tracers.   "This harbor is 
a bomber's paradise", the Britisher had said with frank grimness. 
"It's up to you to protect yourselves. We can't expect any 
help from the fighters at Foggia, either. They're all being used on 
offensive missions".   Vesole had been stunned. Not fire until 
the bombs came down! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable 
fluid beneath his feet and shook his head. Like hell! Like hell 
he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out? 
What would his guns guide on then- the North Star? Ensign 
Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering 
of the bombs, and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/~c Donald 
L& Norton and Seaman 1/~c William A& Rochford on the guns 
and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette. 
Below decks, Seaman 1/~c Stanley Bishop had begun to write 
a letter home. ##

Above decks on the <John Harvey,> Lieutenant 
Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and 
felt uneasy. There were lights glinting in the city, too, even though 
it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible. Bari was 
asking for it, he thought.   For five days now, they had been 
in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold. Richardson wondered 
when it would be unloaded. He hoped they would put it somewhere way, 
way down in the earth. The burden of his secret was pressing down 
on him, as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men. 
Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the <John 
Harvey> in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing 
more dangerous than high explosive bombs. They seemed happy at the 
delay in unloading, glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty 
port such as Bari. Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already. 
Deck Cadet James L& Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had 
been the first to leave. Richardson had returned their departing grins 
with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in 
trade.   The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his men, 
had remained aboard. Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly. 
Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor- 
Porto Vecchio. The night was so clear that Richardson had no 
difficulty making out the silhouette. Then the thought of a cloudless 
sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward. His eyes boggled.

It was a clear night and it was raining!   Capt& Michael 
A& Musmanno, Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula, had 
also seen and felt the "rain". But he had mistaken it for bugs.

Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant 
name <Unsinkable> had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed 
olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population. Musmanno 
was on deck. At exactly 7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush 
his face. He snatched at it savagely. He turned the beam of his flashlight 
on it. He laughed. It was the silver foil from the chocolate 
bar he had been eating. He frowned. But how could-? Another, 
longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth. It was two feet long. It was 
not candy wrapping.   It was "window"- the tinsel paper 
dropped by bombers to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds 
of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.   "Fermate"! 
Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen. "Stop! Stop 
the engines"!   <Unsinkable> slowed and stopped, hundreds 
of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the air 
raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the anti-aircraft guns coughed 
and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came 
whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor 
at Bari.   They had come from airports in the Balkans, these 
hundred-odd Junkers 88's. They had winged over the Adriatic, they 
had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her, 
attacking with deadly skill. They had ruined the radar warning system 
with their window, they had made themselves invisible above their flares. 
And they also had the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns, 
and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on. After the first two 
were blacked out, the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian 
crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring 
homing beacon until British ~MP's shot it out.   In that 
interval, the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor.   Merchant 
ships illuminated in the light of the flares, made to seem like 
stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud, were impossible to miss. 
The little <Unsinkable> sank almost immediately. Captain Musmanno 
roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for 
a raft. They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few 
minutes before their schooner went under.   <John Bascom> 
went down early, too. Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly, 
but they had no targets. Most of the Junkers were above the 
blinding light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore gun had 
been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs. Vesole rushed 
from gun to gun, attempting to direct fire. He was wounded, but fought 
on. Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors. 
Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20~mm gun, pumping out 400 rounds 
before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One, Three and 
Five. Now the <Bascom> was mortally wounded. Luckily, she was 
not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.

The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of pain could 
be heard from the wounded below decks.

THERE IS a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at 
you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed in amazement. You explain, 
"I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this 
very same event before. I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed 
this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in 
the past"!   This experience will have happened to many of 
you.   Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "**h startling experience 
which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular 
passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same 
order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have 
been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard 
precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when".

Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling 
as the <deja vue (already seen)> illusion, just as they dismiss 
dream previsions as coincidences. In this manner they side-step the seemingly 
hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which 
all of us grope continually.   When a man recognizes a certain 
experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance 
of <deja vue>, 
except for the fact that he knows just why the experience 
seems familiar. Occasionally there are examples of prevision 
which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.

One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an event 
which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream, detailed 
the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion 
was completely mystified.   Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the "jargon" 
of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered 
"**h how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life 
film"? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in <Something 
About Myself>.   One day when he attended a war memorial 
ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout 
man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the 
rough slab flooring and someone, clasping him by the arm, whispered, 
"I want a word with you, please". At that moment Kipling was 
overwhelmed with awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical 
details of scene, action and word had occurred to him in a dream six 
weeks earlier.   Freud probably contributed more than anyone else 
to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents 
in our wakeful thoughts. However, readers who accept Freud's 
findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of 
dreams, should ponder over the following words in his <Interpretation 
Of Dreams,> Chapter /1,: "**h as a matter of fact no such 
complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case, 
and what is more, every one attempting such solution has found that 
in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream 
the source of which he has been unable to explain **h nor is the discussion 
closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams".

Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance, 
prevision and retrovision. <The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces 
all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical 
dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual continuities>.

I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream in which I 
lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town. I am 
sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence, 
so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news pictures 
I have seen. And when psychology explains glibly, "but the subconscious 
mind is able to produce it" it refers to a mental region so vaguely 
identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably 
as part of the individual mind.   Skeptics may deny the 
more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally 
observed, but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance 
of routine evidence.   The question becomes, "What is 
a dream"?   Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?

Every dream, and this is true of a mental image of any type 
even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful 
thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available. 
In most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals or objects. 
But these are dreamed in original action, in some particular continuity 
which we don't remember having seen in real life. For instance, 
the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with 
photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car; whereas, it is 
a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car. There is nothing to 
suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original, 
realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.

The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of 
a mental image can find no logical support. <A "mental image" subconsciously 
impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful 
thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at 
all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory 
stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension>.   Dreams 
that display events of the future with photographic detail call 
for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including 
that weird feeling of <deja vue>, inevitably fantastic though 
that theory must seem.   As in the theory of perception, established 
in psycho-physiology, the eye is recognized as an integral part 
of the brain. But then this theory confesses that it is completely at 
a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain. The 
opening paragraph of the chapter titled <The Theory Of Representative 
Perception,> in the book <Philosophies Of Science> by 
Albert G& Ramsperger says, "**h passed on to the brain, and there, 
by some unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception".

But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image 
within the brain? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral 
function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between 
the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation 
from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the 
transmission 
of an image which is already in required location. Hereby, 
the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen, 
not the retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive 
cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory 
centers, motor tensions, associated word symbols, and consciousness.

Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists 
of minute waves of energy. We know that the number of radio and 
television impulses, sound waves, ultra-violet rays, etc&, that may 
occupy 
the very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency, is infinite. 
So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal, 
apparently momentary states of matter, successive one after 
another in consciousness, but permanent each on its own basic phase of 
the progressive frequencies. This theory makes it possible for any 
event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to 
consciousness.   Space in any form is completely measured by the 
three dimensions. If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and 
not purely metaphysical, through what medium does it extend? It is 
not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science 
fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past, 
or the ever-existent past-fantasy future. Three seconds flat is the 
usual time, and the space is crossed by moderate mileage, while the 
overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static 
pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which 
perpetuate all events.   The body, senses and brain, in common with 
all matter, have their counterpart on each of a countless number of 
frequencies. The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only 
of phenomena that share its own frequency, whereas those upon all other 
frequencies are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them. Consciousness 
is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory 
impressions. When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the 
wakeful world, it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present 
past and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one left 
when the body tired and required sleep.   If the photographically 
realistic continuity of dreams, however bizarre their combinations, 
denies that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must be compounded 
from views of diverse realities, although some of them may never 
be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.   Dr& 
H& V& Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University 
of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with 
the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B&C&) escorted him to the treasure 
chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information 
about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification. 
As a matter of fact, the incorrect classification, the result 
of many weeks of labor by Dr& Hilprecht, was about to be published 
by him the following day. Some time later the missing part of the relic 
was found and the complete inscription, together with other new evidence, 
fully corroborated the ancient priest's information. Dr& 
Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest 
in his dream. He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite, 
and imagined it must have been German or English.   We may 
conclude that all six points of information, ostensibly given by the 
dream priest, <could have> been furnished by Dr& Hilprecht's 
<subconscious> reasoning. But, in denying any physical reality for 
this dream, how could the brain possibly compose that realistic, vividly 
visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout, violent break or 
sudden substitution? Which theory is more fantastic: 1. that the 
perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions 
in the professor's brain, or 2. that the dream was a reality on the 
infinite progressions of universal, gradient frequencies, across which 
the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met?

The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines 
whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or 
the vaguely, effective source of the weird <deja vue> feeling. No 
doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the 
sleeper's mind. Probably less than one percent of our previsions 
escape final obliteration before we wake. When we arrive at the events 
concerned in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress 
us as anything familiar. Nevertheless, there are notably frequent 
instances of <deja vue,> in which our recognition of an entirely novel 
event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which, 
though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive 
corps of psychologists. If <deja vue> is an illusion, then peculiarly, 
it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most 
level-headed people.   Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for 
the Republican Presidential nomination, was attending a convention 
at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt 
for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary 
chairman was a man he had never met. After the preliminary business 
affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech 
that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt. If Depew had told any 
academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through 
that identical convention session at some time in the past, he would 
have been informed that he was a victim of <deja vue>. But the famous 
orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene. He remembered 
exactly when he had lived through it before, and he had something 
to prove he had.   One week before the convention, Depew was 
seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing at the opposite 
shore.

"THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL and it is a lot of fun to be here"!

So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents 
from North Country School, Lake Placid, New York. In this 
one sentence, he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition 
and psychological programs in operation at the school.   Because 
the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value, care 
for its origin, and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients, 
the food <does> taste good. When served in a psychological 
atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from 
what they eat because they are free from tension, a foundation is laid 
for a high level of health that releases the children from physical 
handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments, the 
athletic programs and the most important phase, the educational opportunities.

Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain 
scenery in the country, the school buildings are located amid open 
fields 
and farm lands. These contemporary structures, beautifully adapted to 
a school in the country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen, 
grades four through eight. From fourteen states and three foreign 
countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June.

The Director, Walter E& Clark, believes that a school 
with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility 
for their welfare. To him this means caring for the whole child, 
providing basic nutrition, and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom 
for the development of the mind. 

#IMPROVED FARMING METHODS#

The 
concept of good nutrition really began with the garden. The school has 
always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school. In a climate 
hostile to agriculture, Mr& Clark has had to keep alert to the 
most productive farm techniques.   Where a growing season may, 
with luck, allow 60 days without frost, and where the soil is poor, 
sandy, quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail. Throughout 
the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear 
ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.   Mr& Clark 
found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing, use of chemical fertilizers 
and insecticides, plus the application of conservation principles 
of rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato 
fields and depreciation of the soil.   "To give up these 
notions required a revolution in thought", Mr& Clark said in reminiscing 
about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began 
reading "Organic Gardening" and "Modern Nutrition" in a 
search for help with his problems.   "Louis Bromfield's writings 
excited me as a conservationist". By 1952 he was convinced he 
would no longer spray. He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it 
still remains. After reading "Plowman's Folly" by Edward H& 
Faulkner, he stopped plowing.   The basis for compost materials 
already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the 
riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage, a beef herd 
and wastes of all kinds. Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for 
coffee grounds and egg shells.   All these materials and supplementary 
manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry 
farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year. It was applied 
with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader. 
Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed 
the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity. Soon after 
the method changed, visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate 
his soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it was the soil treatment 
alone that accomplished this.   To demonstrate the soil 
of his vegetable gardens as it is today, Mr& Clark stooped to scoop 
up a handful of rich dark earth. Sniffing its sweet smell and letting 
it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed to the nearby 
driveway and said, "This soil used to be like that hard packed 
road over there".   "People and soils respond slowly", says 
Walter Clark, "but the time has now come when the gardens produce 
delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program. No 
chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are 
used".   The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas, 
potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the 
root cellar. The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter; 
the cabbage and squash keep until March or April. There is never 
enough corn, peas or strawberries.   Mr& Clark still has 
to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields, but he 
has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued 
use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in 
the 
future. A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter.

New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil 
treatment. "After the soil, the kitchen", says Mr& Clark. The 
first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of 
white bread.   "Adults take a long time to convince and you are 
thwarted if you try to push". At first the kitchen help was tolerant, 
but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves. "You 
can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread", was an early 
complaint. Of course they learned in time that they not only could use 
whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better. 

#HOMEMADE BREAD# 

Mrs& Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and cared for 
the ordering. Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be 
kitchen manager. Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and 
baked into bread. Mr& Clark's studies taught him that the only 
way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the 
flour. Once the grains are ground, vitamin ~E begins to deteriorate 
immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the 
air within one week.   A mill stands in a room off the kitchen. 
Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in 
the state. Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat, oats, and soy 
beans and turns on the motor. She goes on about her work and listens 
for the completion of the grinding. The bread baked from this mixture 
is light in color and fragrant in aroma. It is well liked by the children 
and faculty.   There is one problem with the bread. "Lillian's 
bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here 
that it is hard not to eat too much", said the secretary ruefully eyeing 
her extra pounds. 

#HOT, FRESHLY-GROUND CEREAL#

The school has 
not used cold prepared cereals for years, though at one time that was 
all they ever served. When the chance came, they first eliminated 
cold cereal once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground 
cereal every day.   They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal. 
Occasionally, the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal 
which they call "buckshot". At the beginning of the school year, 
the new students don't eat the cereal right away, but within a short 
time they are eating it voraciously.   When they leave for vacations 
they miss the hot cereal. The school has received letters from 
parents asking, "What happened to Johnny? He never used to like 
any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants. Where can we 
get this cereal he likes so much"? 

#BODY-BUILDING FOODS#

Salads 
are served at least once a day. Vegetables are served liberally. Most 
come from the root cellar or from the freezer. Home-made sauerkraut 
is served once a week. Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads 
and dishes such as chop suey. Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to 
bread and causes the children to remark, "Lillian, did you put nuts 
in the bread today"?   Milk appears twice a day. The school 
raises enough poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs. 
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served. Hens are kept 
on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility.

Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue and heart are 
planned once a week. Also, salt water fish is on the table once a week.

For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once a week. 
Most other desserts are fruit in some form, fresh fruits once daily 
at least, sometimes at snack time. Dried fruits are purchased from sources 
where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed. Apples come 
from 
a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed. Oranges and grapefruit 
are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm.   Finding 
sources for these high quality foods is a problem. Sometimes the 
solution comes in unexpected ways. Following a talk by Mr& Clark 
at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man 
from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school 
from Vermont.   Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are 
used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat loaves. Miss 
Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available 
at the tables. Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table 
for the children to help themselves.   Very few fried foods are 
used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged. Drinking with meals 
is also discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables.

Nothing is peeled. The source is known so there is no necessity 
to remove insecticide residues. The cooking conserves a maximum 
of the vitamin ~C content of vegetables by methods which use very 
little water and cook in the shortest time possible. 

#WHOLESOME SNACKS, 
NO CANDY#

Since Mr& Clark believes firmly that the chewing 
of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw vegetables and 
raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat 
cookies at snack time in the afternoons. To solve the problem of the 
wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot, a ball of 
maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.

On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains, the children 
carry whole grains to munch along the trail. They learn to like 
these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the 
oats he was feeding his horse at chore time. They tasted good to him, 
so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk 
and honey.   Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods 
on the school grounds. This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar 
on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking. Candy is 
not allowed. Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats 
consisting of fruit and nuts, but no candy. 

#NOURISHING MEALS# 

Mr& Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit, hot cereal, 
milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs. The heavy 
meal comes in the middle of the day. Soup is often the important dish 
at supper. Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich in dissolved 
minerals and vitamins.   The school finds that the children 
are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high 
in quality. The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a 
day. 

#OUTDOOR EXERCISES#

Even before he saw the necessity of growing 
better food and planning good nutrition, Mr& Clark felt the school 
had a good health program. Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and 
a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule. A vigorous 
program existed in skiing, skating sports and overnight hiking. 

#HEALTHIER 
CHILDREN#

Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he 
can report on improvements in health, though he considers the following 
statements observations and not scientific proof.   Visitors to 
the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring 
out the sheen. The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.

BUFFETED by swirling winds, the little green biplane struggled 
northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf. Wires 
whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine 
roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He 
peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again 
below.   "Good old iron compass"! he thought.   A plume 
of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind 
a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored 
to set the ruptured roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered 
Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's 
main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days after the Great 
Flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster in the state's 
history- 
the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United 
States mails.   Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen 
for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday, 
November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's 
Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for 
Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters 
shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still had offices- 
and wondered how to move the mail. The state's railroad system 
counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way: it would 
obviously remain out of commission for weeks. And once medicine, 
food, clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims, 
communications and the mail were the next top problems.   From 
Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain 
to the railroad at Port Kent, N& Y&. But what came in was piling 
up. The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord, 
N& H&. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National 
Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed 
a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that 
at Montpelier too.   The question was "Where to land"? 
There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator 
John J& Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort 
Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots 
were bringing their wide-winged "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters 
to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.   The only 
available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was 
on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where 
takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions. 
Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water, and 
bridges were crumpled and gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines 
and yeast by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee 
and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry, Vermont National 
Guard, laid out runways on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill. 
The "Barre Aviation Field" was set to receive its first 
aircraft the Sunday following the flood.   Though the makeshift 
airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to 
keep any kind of mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training 
consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out of established 
airports, And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with 
the water cooled engines of their World War /1, planes. It seemed 
like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering 
the post office department to contract for the transport of first 
class mail by air. They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the 
terminals.   Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier 
in the right place at the right time: Robert S& Fogg, a native 
New Englander, had been a World War /1, flying instructor, barnstormer, 
and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport. Tall, 
wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical 
first in air mail history. Piloting a Curtiss Navy ~MF flying 
boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the original 
Rural Delivery air service in America.   During the excitement 
following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil 
aviators overnight became legendary heroes. In Concord, Bob 
Fogg 
was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings. Public-spirited 
backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at putting their 
city and state on the flying map. The ship was a Waco biplane, one 
of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225~HP 
Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind. A trim green and silver-painted 
craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the Waco was entered to 
compete in the "On-to-Spokane" Air Derby of 1927. As a matter 
of fact, Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the 
race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service 
and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his 
wry-faced backers. So with all this experience, Bob Fogg was a natural 
choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract. 
His work began just six days after the flood.   By airline 
from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles, counting 
a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier. 
The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back 
of the State House when the wind was right, and used Wilson flat 
above Barre when it wasn't. Between the unsafe Towne field and the 
long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to 
Wilson flat, arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory. 
Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck, begged the postal 
officials that met him to find a safer landing place, preferably 
on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River.   "But 
Fogg", they countered, "we can't get over there. And besides you 
seem to make it all right here". It took a tragedy to bring things 
to a head. After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind 
takeoffs, Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage 
of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field. Sent to 
Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red Cross Aide Reuben 
Sleight had been killed, and his pilot, Lt& Franklin Wolfe, badly 
injured. With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply 
flown into the hillside.   Faced with this situation, Postmaster 
Charles F& McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington 
trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the heights 
of Berlin. A long flat known as the St& John field seemed to answer 
their purpose, and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable, 
they decided to use it.   With a wary eye on the farmer's 
bull, Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr& St& John marked the 
field with a red table cloth. As a wind direction indicator, they tied 
a cotton rag to a sapling. With these aids, and a pair of skiis substituting 
for wheels on the Waco, Bob Fogg made the first landing on 
what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21, 
1927.   Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail 
pouches. During the second week of operations, Fogg received a telegram 
from the Post Office Department, asking him to "put on two airplanes 
and make two flights daily, plus one Sunday trip". Since 
Fogg's was a one-man, one-plane flying service, this meant that he 
would have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day, under sub-freezing 
temperature conditions.   Over the weeks, America's 
first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the 
vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation. 
Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into 
flying togs over the furnace register of his home. Always troubled 
by poor circulation in his feet, he experimented with various combinations 
of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's 
boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them. A sheep-lined 
leather flying suit, plus helmet, goggles and mittens completed 
his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit. The airman's stock answer 
to "Weren't you cold"? became "Yes, the first half hour 
is tough, but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it"!

As daylight began to show through the frosty windows, Fogg would 
place a call to William A& Shaw at the U& S& Weather Station 
at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature and wind-velocity readings. 
Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility 
by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station. 
"Ceilings" were judged by comparison with known mountain heights 
and cloud positions. Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather 
picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank 
E& Hartwell.   Out at the airport each morning, Fogg's 
skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running 
in the drafty hangar. (He'd get the engine oil flowing with an 
electric heater under a big canvas cover.) Wishing to show that aviation 
was dependable and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point 
of taking off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding rain, snow 
and sleet in true postal tradition. Concord learned to set its clocks 
by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead. Sometimes 
the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his 
trips were completed.   Plane radios were not yet available, 
and once in the air, Fogg flew his ship by compass, a good memory for 
landmarks as seen from above, and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick 
computation. Often, threading through the overcast, he was forced 
to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski 
or the White River along the line of the broken railroad. When 
driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg would chandelle up 
and over to reverse course and try another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee 
up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain 
passes.   The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on 
these trips. It ticked over smoothly, idling while Fogg exchanged 
mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen, 
and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St& John field.

Sometimes, on a return trip, the aviator would "go upstairs" high 
over the clouds. There he'd take a compass heading, figure his 
air speed, and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over 
the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe 
to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him. 
Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight 
and Ground Control Approach systems. At the end of the calculated 
time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break 
through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.

Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just time 
to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab a bit of Mrs& Fogg's 
hot broth before starting the second trip. Day after day Fogg shuttled 
back and forth on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers 
in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the 
stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.   The 
flyer had his share of near-misses. At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present 
wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing 
like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated. Once the soldiers from 
the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved 
the engine and got the tail up. At a nod of his head they let go, 
turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream. Tracks in the 
snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet.

One afternoon during a cold, powdery snowstorm, Fogg took off for 
Concord from the St& John field. 
{A}re you retiring now? If so, are you saying, "Where did 
the last 
few years go? How did I get to be sixty-five so fast? What do 
I do now"?   Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly. 
Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire. We always 
thought we would die with our boots on. Out of the blue comes talk 
of pension plans. Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our 
horizon. Still, it seems in the far future. Suddenly, one day, up it 
pops! Sixty-five years and you've had it!   So, now what? 
Oh sure! You've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way. 
But! It never seemed real; never seemed as if it could happen 
to you; only to the other fellow.   Now! Here it is! How 
am I going to live? What am I going to do? Where do I go from 
here?   A great many retired people are the so-called white 
collar workers. Are you one of these?   If so, you are of the 
old school. You are conscientious, hard working, honest, accurate, 
a good penman, and a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends. 
Everything must balance to the last penny. Also you can spell, without 
consulting a dictionary for every other word. You never are late 
for work and seldom absent. ##

{Actually, you can take no special 
credit for this.} It is the way you were taught and your way of 
life. All this is standard equipment for a man of your day; your stock 
in trade; your livelihood.   However, the last few years 
of your life, things seem to be changing. Your way doesn't seem to 
be so darned important any more. You realize you are getting in the old 
fogy class. To put it bluntly, you are getting out-moded.   What's 
happened? The answer is a new era.   Now, looming on 
the horizon are such things as estimated totals, calculated risks and 
I&B&M& machines. The Planning Dept& comes into existence. 
All sorts of plans come to life. This is followed by a boom in conferences. 
Yes sir! Conferences become very popular. When a plan 
burst its seams, hasty conferences supply the necessary patch, and life 
goes merrily on. That's called progress! The new way of life! 
Let's face it! You had your day and it was a good day. Let this 
generation have theirs. Time marches on!   Well, to get back 
to the problem of retirement. Every retiring person has a different 
situation facing him. Some have plenty of money- some have very little 
money. Some are blest with an abundance of good health- some 
are in poor health and many are invalids. Some have lovely homes- 
some live in small apartments. Some have beautiful gardens- some not 
even a blade of grass. Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept 
what they have, and make the most of it (a wonderful gift to have, 
believe me)- some see only darkness, the bitter side of everything. 
Well, whatever you have, that's it! You've got to learn to 
live with it.   Now! The question is "How are you going to 
live with it"? ##

{You can sit back and moan and bewail your 
lot.} Yes! You can do this. But, if you do, your life will 
be just one thing- unhappiness- complete and unabridged.   It 
seems to me, the first thing you've got to do, to be happy, is to 
face up to your problems, no matter what they may be. Make up your mind 
to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years 
of life. One thing, I am sure of, you must get an interest in life. 
You've got to do something.   Many of you will say, "Well, 
what can I do"?   Believe me! There are many, many things 
to do. Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl. 
If you can't think of a thing to do, try something- anything. 
Maybe you will surprise yourself.   True! We are not all great 
artists. I, frankly, can't draw a straight line. Maybe you are 
not that gifted either, but how about puttering around with the old paints? 
You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it. Anyway, 
I'll bet you have a lot of fun.   Do you like to sew? Does 
making your own clothes or even doll clothes, interest you? Do 
you love to run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes? If 
you do, go to it. There is always a market for this line of work. Some 
women can sit and sew, crochet, tat or knit by the hour, and look 
calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work. Where sewing is concerned, 
I'm a total loss. When you see a needle in my hands you will 
know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on, 
or get out the safety pins.   Then again, there's always that 
lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs. Not for me, but perhaps 
just the thing for you.   {Well! How's about mosaic 
tile, ceramics or similar arts and crafts?} Some people love to 
crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with 
as a result of their cracking good time.   How about the art of 
cooking? Do you yearn to make cakes and pies, or special cookies 
and candies? There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy, 
in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets 
to the contrary.   Some people can carve most anything out 
of a piece of wood. Some make beautiful chairs, cabinets, chests, doll 
houses, etc&. 
Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried 
to see what you could do with a hunk of wood? Outside of cutting your 
fingers, maybe you would come up with nothing at all, but then again, 
you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.   Some women get 
a real thrill out of housework. They love to dust, scrub, polish, 
wax floors, move the furniture around from place to place, take down the 
curtains, put up new ones and have themselves a real ball. Maybe that's 
your forte. It certainly isn't mine. I can look at furniture 
in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's 
where it belongs. ##

{Perhaps you would like to become a writer.} 
This gives you a wide and varied choice. Will it be short stories, 
fiction, nonfiction, biography, poetry, children's stories, or even 
a book if you are really ambitious?   Ever since I was a 
child, I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing. If you do 
decide to write, you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips 
and dejection. Don't be discouraged! This is just being a normal 
writer. Just let the rejection slips fall where they may, and keep 
on plugging, and finally you will make the grade. Few new writers have 
their first story accepted, so they tell me. But, it could happen, 
and it may happen to you.   Then there's always hobbies, collecting 
stamps, coins, timetables, salt and pepper shakers, elephants, 
dogs, dolls, shells, or shall we just say collecting anything your heart 
desires?   I can hear some of you folks protesting. You say, 
"But it costs a lot of money to have a hobby. I haven't got that 
kind of money".   True! It does cost a lot of money for 
most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free. How about a rock 
collection, or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs 
and in different colors? Then, take flowers. They are many and varied. 
Also, there's scrap books, collecting newspaper pictures and 
clippings, or any items of interest to you. It's getting interested 
in something that counts. ##

{As for me, I am holding in reserve 
two huge puzzles (I love puzzles)} to put together when time hangs 
heavy on my hands. So far, the covers have never been off the 
boxes. I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now.

So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise you to make 
the most of each day, enjoy each one to the ~n'th degree. Travel, 
if you can. Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life 
and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to 
be sunshine sweet.   Good Luck! To one and all- Good Days 
ahead! 
{A}n important criterion of maturity is creativity. The mature 
person 
is creative. What does it mean to be creative, a term we hear with increasing 
frequency these days? When we turn to Noah Webster we find 
him helpful as usual. "To be creative is to have the ability to 
cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth 
an original production of human intelligence or power". We are creative, 
it seems, when we produce something which has not previously existed. 
Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake, building 
a chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business, creating 
a League of Nations or, developing a mature character.   All 
living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence 
the power of creativity, if it is only to reproduce a form like their 
own. While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors 
in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal with a true 
non-instinctive and conscious creative ability. An animal, bird or 
insect creates either a burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness 
according to specie. Man's great superiority over these evolutionary 
forbears is in the development of his imagination. This gives him the 
power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories, ideas 
and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment 
in new and ever-changing forms. ##

{I}t has been 
truly said 
that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting 
this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world. In our 
own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne 
come into actuality. The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a 
poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 
1941. In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's 
projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more. It 
is in this one aspect, at least, that man seems to be made in the image 
of his Creator.   Not only can man project his imagination 
out into his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly, 
he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself. 
We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training 
can become athletes, acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing 
many potentialities. We know that actors can learn to portray 
a wide variety of character roles. By this same combination of the 
will and the imagination, each one of us can learn to portray permanently 
the kind of character we would like to be. We must realize with 
Prof& Charles Morris in his THE OPEN SELF that "Man is the 
being that can continually remake himself, the artisan that is himself 
the material for his own creation". ##

{S}o far in 
history man 
has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment 
rather than first creating the sort of person who can make 
the highest use of the things he has created. Is not the present world 
crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us 
and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall 
the tragedy. Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend 
our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our 
own maturing process?   Sir Julian Huxley in his book UNIQUENESS 
OF MAN makes the novel point that just as man is unique in 
being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood 
under family protection, so is he the only animal who has a long 
period after the decline of his procreativity.

SOME recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples 
are a thing of the remote, Victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners 
are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough 
from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all 
the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.   Perhaps- but extensive 
discussions with contemporary practitioners, family doctors and 
gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance. 
Joking and talking may be freer and easier, but the important factual 
information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men 
and women.   Various factors in the setting can still be of great 
advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad 
memory for one or both. Privacy must be highly assured both in time and 
place. That is, locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of 
location, but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough 
for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.   If the wedding party lasted 
late, and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before 
resuming the trip or making an early start, the husband may forestall 
tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying 
in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours. The 
consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long 
private time (day or night) for that purpose. ##

First intercourse 
for the bride brings with it the various problems connected 
with virginity and the hymen.   <One thing should be clear to 
both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur 
when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act. Ignorance on this 
point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety, misunderstanding 
and suspicion>.   The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane 
that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most 
female human beings who have not had sex relations. (Hymen, in fact, 
is the Greek word for membrane.)   Often it is thin and fragile 
and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse. 
As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed very little 
and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.

It is also important to realize that many girls are born without 
a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that <the absence 
of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex 
relations>.   But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations 
of the folk-lore beliefs. Some hymens are so strongly developed that 
they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked 
loss of blood. More rarely, the hymen is so sturdy that it does not 
yield to penetration.   Extreme cases are on record in which the 
doctor 
has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital 
relations to be consummated. These cases, for all their rarity, are 
so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general 
population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen 
is a serious problem to newly-weds. 
##

In recent times, when sexual 
matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly, 
the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention. 
Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new 
situation. Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of 
making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?

<Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride 
should consult a physician before marriage. If he foresaw any problem 
because of the quality of the hymen, it was recommended that simple 
procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably, 
to dilate it>.   As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was 
often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for 
painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.   This recommendation 
was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth 
consummation of the sex act. The vagina is an organ capable of 
remarkable contraction and dilation. This is obvious when it is remembered 
that, during childbirth, the vagina must dilate enough to permit 
the passage of the baby.   The intricate system of muscles that 
manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under 
voluntary control. But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious 
intention of the woman. That is, when first penetration takes 
place, the pressure and pain signals may <involuntarily> cause all the 
vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent 
further pain. ##

The advantages 
of dilatation by the physician 
are both physical and psychological. Since it is a purely professional 
situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making or the 
beloved. By using instruments of gradually increasing size, the vagina 
is gently, and with minimum pain at each stage, taught to yield to 
an object of the appropriate shape.   In this process the vaginal 
muscles come under better conscious control by the girl. She learns 
how to relax them to <accept>- instead of contracting them to <repel> 
the entering object.   Apart from the standard problem of 
controlling the vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that 
need special gynecological treatment. It is far better to have such 
conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon 
where they can create a really serious situation.   When no 
medical problems exist, the newly married couple generally prefer to 
cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves. Special 
information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still 
of great value. Folk-lore, superstition and remembered passages from 
erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly 
taken as scientific facts and useful hints. ##

<The importance 
of loving tenderness is obvious. The long, unhurried approach and 
the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels. Under 
the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes 
and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases, providing an excellent 
lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration>.   Extensive 
observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established 
the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall 
(the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back) may cause 
a great deal of distress in a virgin. <But> during the same examination, 
<two> fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall (the 
bottom of the vagina in the same position) without any pain; and in 
fact without any difficulty <if the pressure is kept downward at all 
times>.   These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may 
be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse. The husband 
and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in 
mind. They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too 
much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at 
least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer 
a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.   In 
fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely 
adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.

Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing 
the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration. 
The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain 
while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased 
with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling 
the problem once and for all.   <Such talk is seriously in error. 
Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride, 
both physically and psychologically. The insistent, forceful penetration 
may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage 
to the hymen>.   <The pain and distress associated with 
the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital 
relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the sex act unpleasant 
and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate 
his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it>. ## 

Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in 
the honeymoon situation. The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's 
hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous 
desire. The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience 
a premature climax. This is a very common experience and should in 
no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.   Or the 
frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of 
the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him 
to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period. The signals 
to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to 
take advantage of them.   The best course is to recover his physical 
excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again. This 
may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding 
and self-centered. He can take security from the fact that the 
progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost. 
Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses from her, his bride 
will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him 
restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they 
both so eagerly desire.   A final word. The accumulated information 
on this point shows that first intercourse, even when it is achieved 
with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom an overwhelming sexual 
experience to a woman. Too many new things are happening for it to 
be a complete erotic fulfillment.   Only under rare circumstances 
would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse. Both 
man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax, and 
even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that 
the wife may be cold or frigid.   If the early approaches are wise, 
understanding and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment 
will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.

WRITING in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures, 
titled <The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,> Kenneth 
Clark declares: "**h The human body, as a nucleus, is rich in associations. 
**h It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things 
we wish to do with ourselves".   Perhaps this is a clue to 
the amazing variety and power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated 
by the nude form.   The wide divergence of reactions 
is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality. 
Differences were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds. 
Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt 
to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated beyond the eighth 
grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.

Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating 
thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that 
her husband had "never seen her entirely naked", while another woman, 
boasting an equal number of years of married life, is proud of having 
"shared the nudist way of life- the really free, natural nude 
life- for most of that period".   Attempts at censorship always 
involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions. 
The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude 
human form as "lewd 
and pornographic, a threat and danger" to all the young, or good, 
or religious, or moral persons.   The equally ardent proponent 
of 
freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the 
"natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and the epitome 
of beauty and inspiration".   One is always a little surprised 
to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected. I 
still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic 
advocate of the "clean, healthful, free way of natural life 
in nudism", who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution 
in fine spirit.

@ IN TRADITION and in poetry, the marriage bed is a place 
of unity and harmony. The partners each bring to it unselfish love, 
and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.   At its 
most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly 
cares. Everything else is closed away.   This is the ideal. 
But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy 
are seldom achieved. Instead one partner or the other dominates the 
sexual relationship. In the past, it has been the husband who has been 
dominant and the wife passive. But today there are signs that these 
roles are being reversed.   In a growing number of American homes, 
marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role 
in sexual relationships. It is she who decides the time, the place, 
the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act. It is she who 
says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics- 
not the husband. The whole act is tailored to <her> pleasure, 
and not to <theirs>.   Beyond a certain point, of course, 
no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that. But there is little 
doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.

Of course, there remain many "old-fashioned" marriages in 
which the husband maintains his supremacy. Yet even in these marriages, 
psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly. The 
meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's 
or grandmother's standards.   To many experts, this trend was 
inevitable. They consider it simply a sign of our times. Our society 
has "emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence and new 
authority. It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual 
role.   "The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum", 
declares Dr& Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director of the 
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent 
book, <Release From Sexual Tensions>. "It reflects what is going 
on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself. A world 
in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual 
relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too".

Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination 
of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy 
and even dangerous. It can, in fact, wreck a marriage.   When 
a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she 
is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her. 
And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy. 
On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his self-respect, 
and robs him of his masculinity. He is a target of ridicule 
to his wife, and often- since private affairs rarely remain private- 
to the outside world as well.   "A marriage can survive almost 
any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's 
maleness", declares Dr& Calderone. This opinion is supported 
by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, Dr& Maurice 
E& Linden, director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia 
Department of Public Health.   "When the roles of 
husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the 
husband follower", Dr& Linden says, "the effects on their whole 
relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous". ## 

IN ONE EXTREME case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office 
worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband 
unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded. To win her favors, her 
husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle 
from his employer. Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison. While 
he was in custody his wife divorced him.   More typical is 
the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage 
counselor. This woman repeatedly complained she was "too tired" 
for marital relations. To please her, her husband assumed some of the 
domestic chores. Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the 
children, and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations 
as often as he desired them.   One wife, described by a 
New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed 
their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between 
the weekly ~PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood 
card parties. Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis. After 
every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the 
matter was settled in her favor.   Experts say the partners in 
marriages like these can almost be typed.   The wife is likely 
to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed 
a promising career for marriage. She knows the power of the 
sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.   The husband 
is usually a well-educated professional, preoccupied with his job- 
often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: "Don't 
rock the boat".   Sometimes this leads to his becoming 
demandingly dominant in marriage. Hemmed in on the job and unable to 
assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one 
area.   More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting 
to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule 
at home.   Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound 
husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their 
wives. The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend, 
is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay 
as much attention to her as he does to his job.   Naturally no 
woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative. Unless her 
husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated. Generally, 
however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's 
mercy.   "The pattern", says Dr& Morton 
Schillinger, 
psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy, 
"is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually 
trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight 
is the night".   No one seriously contends, of course, that 
the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world. 
After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic 
figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as Dr& Schillinger 
points out. There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts 
became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master 
bedroom. ##

FURTHERMORE, Dr& Calderone says, a certain 
number of docile, retiring men always have been around. They aren't 
"frigid" and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained 
in all of life. They <like> to be dominated. One such man once 
confided to Dr& Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he 
preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor. Asked why, he replied 
primly: "Because that's no activity for a gentleman".

But such cases were, in the past, unusual. Society here and abroad 
has been built around the dominating male- even the Bible appears 
to endorse the concept.   Family survival on our own Western frontier, 
for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength 
and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom 
questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed.

This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 
20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring 
<Life With Father> manner.   In those days, a wife had mighty 
few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere. 
"Grandma wasn't expected to like it", Dr& Marion Hilliard, 
the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the 
'90s. Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as 
"used" by their husbands- and, history indicates, they often quite 
literally were.   When was the turning point? When did women 
begin to assert themselves sexually? ##

SOME DATE IT from 
woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men 
in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper 
and bathtub gin. Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend 
toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with 
the postwar rush to the suburbs.   Left alone while her husband 
was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties 
normally reserved for the male. Circumstances gave her almost undisputed 
sway over child-rearing, money-handling and home maintenance. 
She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was 
once considered too helpless. She liked this taste of authority and 
independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.

"Very few wives", says Dr& Calderone, "who balance the checkbook, 
fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with 
the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned. 
A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the 
sexual relationship as well".   And an additional factor was 
helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively 
recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response. 
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the 
importance of the female climax. They began to describe in detail the 
woman's capacity for response.   In fact, the noted psychologist 
and sex researcher, Dr& Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that 
women are "sexually superior" to men. According to Dr& Ellis, 
the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual 
arousal than her partner. Not surprisingly, Dr& Ellis says, 
some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.

Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr& Maurice Linden, many 
wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them. An aggressive 
woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under. "When the husband 
becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", Dr& 
Linden says, "the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. Often she 
fails to gain sexual satisfaction".   One such wife, Dr& 
Linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through 
a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger 
man. But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until 
that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity. Then the 
wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.   In some cases, however, 
domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered 
by a passing but urgent emotional need. Thus a man who is butting 
a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed- 
the one place he can still be champion. If his on-the-job problems work 
out, he may return to his old pattern. Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness 
will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels 
age creeping up.   On the other hand, a husband who always has 
been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking, 
psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable. 
Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered 
or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.   In any case, 
Dr& Calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair, 
and can't always be measured by a general yardstick. "As long 
as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little 
difference if one or the other dominates", Dr& Calderone declares. 
"The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment".

Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination 
by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period, 
it is likely to shake the marriage. And just as domination today often 
begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.

"To get a marriage back where it belongs", comments Dr& 
Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, "the husband must take 
some very basic steps. He must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more 
selfish. He must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding 
and less 'understanding'".   Too many husbands, Dr& 
Schillinger continues, worry about "how well they're doing", 
and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual 
play.

SHE GAVE HERSELF a title **h Lady Diana Harrington.

The New York D&A& gave her another **h the Golden Girl 
of cafe society.   Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant, 
title **h prostitute.   And Houston police have the final 
say in the matter since she died there on September 20, 1960, "Diane 
Harris Graham, 30, D&O&A& circumstances- unusual".

Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men, 
there was money, and with the two came luxury and liquor. She was still 
in the play for pay business when she died, a top trollop who had 
given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.

She never hid the fact that she liked to play. Her neighbors 
in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that 
the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as 
"the Golden 
Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial".   It was the trial of 
oleomargarine heir Minot (Mickey) Jelke for compulsory prostitution 
in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl. 
(Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding 
a ring of high-priced call girls.)   Diane was needed as a material 
witness in the case and New York police searched three continents 
before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel, 
of course. She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington, 
a name that made some of the gossip columns.   It was when 
she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation 
she liked best.   Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant 
District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning 
judge:   "This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.

"In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County. In 
the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign 
tycoon who took her to France, where she later met a very wealthy man 
and toured all Europe with him.   "At Deauville she met an 
Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey. He was the official procurer for 
King Farouk, now in exile. She was in Egypt during the revolution 
and had passport difficulty. She lied in order to get it.   "We 
have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally 
back into this country **h She has been acting as a prostitute.

"Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts 
to Jelke".   Diane sobbingly denied this to the court. 
"That's a lie. I never gave that boy a cent. I am not a prostitute, 
and I had only one very wealthy boy friend", she said. 
During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up part of that statement.

"Diane is the type of girl", Jelke said, "who wouldn't 
get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up 
all your money in the middle of the floor".   But she seemed to 
have underestimated the number of her "boy friends".   She 
came to New York from Detroit as a teenager, but with a "sponsor" 
instead of a chaperone. As she told it, "He's a rich boy friend, 
an old guy about 60". She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed, 
but not naive. She had talked her "boy friend" into sending her 
to New York to take a screen test.

The screen test was never made- but Diane was. She quickly 
moved into cafe society, possibly easing her conscience by talking 
constantly of her desire to be in show business.   She seemed 
so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail 
circuit set up a practical joke.   An ex-fighter was introduced 
to her in a bar as "Mr& Warfield, the famous producer". The 
phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.

"I'd love to audition for you", she gushed.   The 
audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment. She 
thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show 
the eminent producer how well she could dance.   After a few minutes 
he said, "I can't use you if you dance like that. I'd like 
to see you dance nude".   She hastily complied. Diane loved 
to dance in the nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.

She developed another quaint habit. Even among the fast set 
in which she was moving, her method for keeping an escort from departing 
too early was unique.   When the date would try to bid her 
good-night at the door, she would tell him, "If you go home now, I'll 
scream". More often than not he would bow to the inevitable.

One who needed no such threats was a French financier. One of 
the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel. She wanted 
to go around the world, but she settled for a French holiday.

In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told 
of spending several months with her. "Then she went to Deauville 
where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers".

The Greek evidently fell for her, "Monsieur ~X" recounted, 
and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he 
gave her 100,000 francs (about $300) and led her to the roulette tables.

She could do no wrong at the tables that time. And in short 
order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way. Smarter 
than most gamblers, she slipped away from the casino, packed her bag 
and took the night train to Paris. No one ever learned what happened 
to the Greek.   The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel, 
the George /5,, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so she high-tailed 
it to Rome.   She teamed up with another beauty, whose 
name has been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling that 
would have made Nero envious.   To climax her Roman revels, she 
was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked 
through its marble halls screaming for help.   It was a rugged 
finish for what must have been a very interesting night.   Discreet 
Italian police described it in a manner typically continental.

"There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom: 
Miss Harrington (this was Diane's choice for a Roman name), 
another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and 
one of your well-known American actors.   "The actor had had 
much to drink and apparently became very violent. The hotel staff, 
as well as residents of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies 
were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.

"They were wearing nothing but their scratches. They were 
asked to leave the hotel. No charges were filed".   The girls, 
after dressing, were indignant.   "You can't do this to 
us", Diane screamed. "We are Americans".   In the morning 
she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally 
luxurious Hotel Ambassador.   With the Ambassador as headquarters, 
she continued to promote good will abroad. Of course, her benevolence 
was limited to those who could afford it, but then there is a 
limit to what one person can do.   By this time Diane was a beguiling 
lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world. She thought 
royal status might come her way when, while she was still in Rome, 
she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt.

A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this 
way:   "It was a strange relationship. Pulley Bey spoke no 
English. Diane spoke no Italian or French. She had a hard time 
making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.   "Pulley 
Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him", the friend 
continued. It seemed as though she were always auditioning. 
No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors, the plump 
Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she 
waited for nine months, vainly hoping to see Farouk.   Pulley 
had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but she grew impatient waiting 
for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the 
royal pimp had no key.   She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends 
from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her. Tewfik 
Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of 
Cairo society enjoyed her company.   "So extensive became her 
circle of admirers", Egyptian police said, "that her escapades 
caused distrust".   The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's 
little world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution 
to bring it down. When Farouk was overthrown, police picked up 
his personal pimp, Pulley Bey. They also called upon Diane with 
a request for a look at her passport.   The cagey Pulley Bey, 
who spoke no English, had taken the passport so that Diane 
couldn't 
leave the country without his approval. Officials provided a temporary 
passport, good only for return to the United States.   And 
return to the United States she did, into waiting arms- the unromantic 
ones of the New York District Attorney's office.   Held 
as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey 
Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed 
to the Women's House of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.

It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk 
the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a 
hotel room, with her meals taken at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian 
restaurant.   Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated 
that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.   With 
the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York **h it was 
no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous "Lady Harrington".

Several years ago she married a Houston business man, Robert 
Graham. She later divorced Graham, who is believed to have moved 
to Bolivia.   Houston police got to know Diane two years ago 
when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring. 
Last May, they said, she admitted being a prostitute.   The 
next time the police saw her she was dead.   It was September 
20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles. 
She had had a party with a regular visitor, Dr& William W& 
McClellan.   McClellan, who had once lost his medical license 
temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with her when she died. 
He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had 
happened during that time. When he realized she was dead, he called 
two lawyers and then the police.   When the police arrived, they 
found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.

The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet and a pink 
blanket covered her. Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the 
walls.   An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's 
body. Police theorize that a combination of dope, drink and 
drugs killed her.   "I think that maybe she wanted it this way", 
a vice squad cop said. "A maid told us that she still bragged 
about getting $50 a date. She was on the junk, and they slide fast when 
that happens. At least she never knew what the bottom was 
like". 
I AM a carpet salesman.   I work for one of the biggest chains 
of retail carpet houses in the East. We cater mostly to nice people 
in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy, 
neon-lit, chromium-plated suburban stores.   I am selling the 
stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams- <wall-to-wall 
carpeting>.   There is only one trouble with this big, 
beautiful dream. From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.

People come to me with confidence. They depend on my supposedly 
expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.

But I knowingly abuse their confidence. 
FRANKLIN D& Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs& 
Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited him in Bakersfield, 
California, several months ago as a prospective patient. "Doctor" 
Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then, 
by squeezing her foot three times, he came up- presto- with a 
different diagnosis with each squeeze. She had- he informed her- 
kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female disorder. (He explained 
that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because 
all of the nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the 
thing for her- a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone generator" 
machine.   As he applied the applicator extending from the 
machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed 
on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions 
of Mrs& Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific 
mumbo-jumbo. Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically 
everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked, why the 
colors of the tubes were important to people's health? The human 
body- he pointed out, for example- required 33 units of blue light. 
For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing 
glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:   "Don't 
you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body".

"Cancer"! Mrs& Shaefer practically shrieked. "You 
didn't tell me I had cancer".   "You have it, all right. 
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing 
to worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with 
97 pounds of cancer in her body".   He urged her to buy one 
of his machines- for $300. When she said that she didn't have the 
money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office 
model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold her minerals to cure 
her kidney ailment, a can of sage "to make her look like a girl again", 
and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.

Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs& Shaefer to buy his machine 
when she visited him the next day. After another treatment with the machine, 
he told her that "her entire body was shot through with tumors 
and cysts". He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would 
take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money 
for buying his machine.   When she submitted to his treatment with 
the capsules, Mrs& Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's 
office, Mrs& Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated 
her for burned tissue. For several days, she was ill as a result 
of Lee's treatment.   Mrs& Shaefer never got around to 
joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone 
machines. For Mrs& Shaefer- who had been given a clean bill 
of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee- and her 
friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection 
Bureau. And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the 
evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder 
under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court for convicting 
Franklin D& Lee. The charge: violation of the California Medical 
Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling 
misbranded drugs. The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the 
county jail.   An isolated case of quackery? By no means. Rather, 
it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic 
devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands 
of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them 
away from legitimate, ethical medical treatment of serious diseases. 
The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and 
ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.   With these gadgets- 
impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs, ticks, 
and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing 
on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of 
our scientific age. He milks the latest scientific advances, translating 
them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his 
fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual 
impotence and cancer.   The gadget faker operates or sells his 
phony machines for $5 to $10,000- 
anything the traffic will bear. He 
may call himself a naprapath, a physiotherapist, an electrotherapist, 
a naturopath, a sanipractor, a medical cultist, a masseur, a "doctor"- 
or what have you. Not only do these quacks assume impressive 
titles, but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific 
or impressive foundations- 
foundations which often have little 
more than a letterhead existence.   The medical device pirate 
of today, of course, is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor 
of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and 
other patent medicines. His plunder is therefore far higher- running 
into hundreds of millions.   According to the Food and Drug 
Administration (~FDA), "Doctor" Ghadiali, Dr& Albert 
Abrams and his clique, and Dr& Wilhelm Reich- to name three notorious 
device quacks- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000, 
5000, and 2000 fake health machines.   Authorities believe 
that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are 
still in business. Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims 
in Cleveland. Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid $1020 to 
a masseur, and Mr& A&, a laborer, paid $4200 to a chiropractor for 
treatment with two fake health machines- the "radioclast" and 
the "diagnometer". Multiply these figures by the millions of people 
known to be conned by medical pirates annually. You will come up 
with a frightening total.   That's why the ~FDA, the American 
Medical Association (~AMA), and the National Better Business 
Bureau (~BBB) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery 
to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical 
charlatans annually.   The Postmaster General recently reported 
that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices 
figure prominently- are at the highest level in history. Similarly, 
the American Cancer Society (~ACS), the Arthritis and Rheumatism 
Foundation, and the ~BBB have each stated lately that medical 
quackery is at a new high. For example, the ~BBB has reported 
it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 
10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.   Authorities 
hesitate to quote exact figures, however, believing that any 
sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by 
their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical 
racketeer. In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates of phony 
device quackery are conservative.   The economic toll that 
the device quack extracts is important, of course. But it is our health- 
more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern 
witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away. 
By preying on the sick, by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate, 
by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical 
ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.   Typically, 
Sarah Gross and Mr& ~A both lost more than their money 
as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks. Sarah 
Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment 
by the masseur were not helping her. As a result, she consulted medical 
authorities and learned that the devices her quack "doctor" was 
using were phony. She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be 
institutionalized.

Mr& A&, her fellow townsman, also experienced 
a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been 
bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been 
treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease, multiple 
sclerosis- and himself. Mr& ~A has recovered, but he is, 
justifiably, a bitter man. "That's a lot of hard-earned money to 
lose", he says today. "Neither me nor my wife were helped by that 
chiropractor's treatments".   And there was the case of Tom 
Hepker, a machinist, who was referred by a friend to a health machine 
quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what 
Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine. After 
his pains got worse, Tom decided to see a real doctor, from whom he 
learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung. Yes, Tom caught 
it in time to stay alive. But he's a welfare case now- a human wreck- 
thanks to this modern witch doctor.   But the machine quack 
can cause far more than just suffering. In such diseases as cancer, 
tuberculosis, and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are so 
vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's 
cure-all gadget can prove fatal. Moreover, the diabetic patient who relies 
on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake 
can be committing suicide. For instance:   In Chicago, 
some time ago, Mr& H&, age 27, a diabetic since he was six, stopped 
using 
insulin because he had bought a "magic spike"- a glass tube 
about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small 
fraction of a cent- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 
as a cure-all. "Hang this around your neck or attach it to other 
parts of your anatomy, and its rays will cure any disease you have", 
said the company. Mr& H& is dead today because he followed this 
advice.   Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken 
by her husband to see Otis G& Carroll, a sanipractor- a licensed 
drugless healer- in Spokane. Carroll diagnosed Mrs& Hull by 
taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his "radionic" 
machine and twirling some knobs (fee $50).   His prescription: 
hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water. Although 
she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted 
her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water. 
Inevitably, Mrs& Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis, weighing 
60 pounds. Moreover, her husband and child contracted T&B& 
from her. (Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 
for his wife's death.)   In California, a few years ago, a ghoul 
by the name of H& F& Bell sold electric blankets as a cure 
for cancer. He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric 
blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died, 
reconditioning them, and selling them at $185 each. When authorities 
convicted him of practicing medicine without a license (he got off with 
a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 
77), one of his victims was not around to testify: He was dead of 
cancer.   By no means are these isolated cases. "Unfortunately", 
says Chief Postal Inspector David H& Stephens, who has prosecuted 
many device quacks, "the ghouls who trade on the hopes of 
the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the 
patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up 
in court". ##

DEATH! Have no doubt about it. That's 
where device quackery can lead. The evidence shows that fake therapeutic 
machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have hastened the 
deaths of thousands.   Who are the victims of the device quacks? 
Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target. Says Wallace 
F& Jannsen, director of the ~FDA's Division of Public Information: 
"Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older 
people, or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, 
diabetes, and cancer. People who have not been able to get 
relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in 
by quacks". The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people, like 
Mr& A&, who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice 
to Doctor Fraud's avarice. They are often ignorant as well as 
underprivileged.

TEN-YEAR-OLD Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome 
for almost a year. His grades had gone steadily downhill, and 
he had stopped bringing 
friends and classmates home from school.

Mr& and Mrs& Stewart were puzzled and concerned. Then one day 
Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door, let the cat out of the 
bag. The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick "Bugs 
Bunny" because his teeth protruded.   When Richard's parents 
told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who 
specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested. 
During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly 
with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved- 
an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his 
facial appearance.   Richard Stewart is no special case. "The 
majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form 
of orthodontic treatment", says Dr& Allan G& Brodie, professor 
and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of 
Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field. 
What do parents need to know about those "years of the braces" in 
order not to waste a child's time and their money? How can they 
tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment? Why and when should 
tooth-straightening be undertaken? What is it likely to cost? 

#TOOTH FIT EXPLAINED#

OCCLUSION is the dentist's expression 
for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion, 
or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for. One main type 
of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper 
front teeth. A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the 
face, a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped lower 
jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type 
of malocclusion.   These two basic malformations have, of course, 
many variations. A child probably requires some form of treatment 
if he has any of the following conditions: _@_ A noticeable 
protrusion of the upper or lower jaw. _@_ Crooked, overlapping, 
twisted, or widely spaced teeth. _@_ Front teeth not meeting 
when the back teeth close. _@_ Upper teeth completely covering 
the lowers when the back teeth close. _@_ The eyeteeth (third from 
the middle on top, counting each front tooth as the first) beginning 
to protrude like fangs. _@_ Second teeth that have come in before 
the first ones have fallen out, making a double row.   Contrary 
to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago, when all malocclusion was 
blamed on some unfortunate habit, recent studies show that most tooth 
irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition. 
However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must 
necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.   Tooth deformity 
may be the result of <excessive> thumb- or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting, 
or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that 
there's a difference between <normal> and <excessive> sucking 
habits. It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and 
no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two 
or three years old. Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect 
a youngster's teeth; but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure 
is frequent, it will have an effect.   Malocclusion can also 
result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long. If a child 
loses a molar at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward 
the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent 
ones and producing a jumble. If baby teeth are retained too long, the 
incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal 
time or may have to erupt in the wrong place. 

#CORRECTION CAN SAVE TEETH# 

EVERY orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by 
their malformed teeth. Some such youngsters rarely smile, or they try 
to speak with the mouth closed. In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's, 
a child's personality is affected. Yet from the dentist's 
point of view, bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.

Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through 
a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots. This serious 
condition, popularly known as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes 
of tooth loss in adults.   Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together 
teeth are prone to trapping food particles, increasing the 
likelihood of rapid decay. "For these and other reasons", says Dr& 
Brodie, "orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth".

The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal 
chewing, so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden 
on his digestive system. Because of these chewing troubles, a child may 
avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition. Badly placed 
teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping. 

#THE WHEN AND 
HOW OF STRAIGHTENING#

"MOST orthodontic work is done on children 
between the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients 
as young as two and as old as 55", says Dr& Brodie.   In 
the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed, 
yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed 
teeth comparatively easy. Orthodontic work is possible because teeth 
are held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal membrane with 
an involved nerve network, to the bone in the jaw; they are not 
anchored directly to the bone. Abnormal pressure, applied over a period 
of time, produces a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions 
normally in the new position into which it has been guided.   What 
can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's 
office? On her first visit the orthodontist will take ~X rays, 
photographs, tooth measurements, and "tooth prints"- an impression 
of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws. 
If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for Susie an appliance 
consisting of bands, plastic plates, fine wires, and tiny springs. This 
appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure 
on the bone. As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure side 
of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on the side from which the 
tooth has moved. This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue 
grows, and no faster.   "If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious 
injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding 
bone holding them in place", explains Dr& Brodie. "Moving one 
or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an ill-conceived plan 
of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face".

During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately 
following each adjustment, Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness, 
but after a short time this will disappear. Parents are often 
concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay. When 
in place, a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth 
that is covered.   Next Susie will enter the treatment stage 
and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on the severity 
of her condition. During these visits the dentist will adjust 
the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.   Last comes the 
<retention> stage. Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable 
new position. But because teeth sometimes may drift back to 
their original position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them in 
place. Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and 
stretching across the teeth. Susie may wear this only at night or for 
a few hours during the day.   Then comes the time when the last 
wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive 
girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.   How long 
will this take? Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may 
take only a few months. Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more. 
An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three 
years to correct. 

#WHAT IS THE COST?#

THE charge for a 
complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country. Work 
that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 
in New York City or Chicago. An average national figure for two 
to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000.   "Factors 
in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill 
and education of the practitioner", says Dr& Brodie.   To 
become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed by his state as 
a dentist, then he must spend at least two years in additional training 
to acquire a license as a specialist.   "Costs may seem high, 
but they used to be even higher", says Dr& Brodie. "Fees 
are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago".   The 
reason? People today are aware of the value of orthodontics, and 
as a result there are more practitioners in the field.   Most 
orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic 
materials and construction of the appliances, but usually the remainder 
of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years. In many 
cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools 
will take patients at a nominal fee. Some municipal agencies will 
pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents. 

#RESEARCH 
HELPS FAMILIES#

GROWTH studies have been carried on consistently 
by orthodontists. Dr& Brodie has 30-year records of head growth, 
started 20 minutes after children's births.   "In the 
past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was 
scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics <do> affect tooth 
formation to a large extent", he says. "Fortunately through our 
growth studies we have been able to see what nature does, and that 
helps us know what we can do".   This knowledge both modifies 
and dictates diagnosis and treatment. For example, a boy may inherit 
a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another. In the past 
an orthodontist might have tried, over four or five years, to straighten 
and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth, 
would never accommodate them. Now a dentist can recommend extraction 
immediately.   In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge 
of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five 
years before treatment. The child is kept on call, and the orthodontist 
watches the growth. "Nature often takes care of the problem", 
says Dr& Brodie. "A child with a certain type of head and teeth 
will outgrow tooth deformity".   That is why Dr& Brodie 
asks parents not to insist, against their dentist's advice, that their 
child have orthodontic work done too early. "Both because of our 
culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions, 
some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it 
is wise to do so. Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start 
treatment", he urges.   Superior new material for orthodontic 
work is another result of research. Plastics are easier to handle 
than the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save time and money. 
Plaster of Paris, once utilized in making impressions of teeth, has 
been replaced by alginates (gelatin-like material) that work quickly 
and accurately and with least discomfort to a child. 

#PREVENTION IS 
BEST#

AS a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is started, 
the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.

"After your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age 
of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment", 
Dr& Brodie advises. "Then see that your youngster 
has a routine checkup once a year".   To help prevent orthodontic 
problems from arising, your dentist can do these things: _@_ 
He can correct decay, thus preventing early loss of teeth. If 
a child <does> lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay- 
and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out 
of position, become overcrowded and malformed. In turn the other teeth 
are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them. 
From time to time the medium mentions other people "around him", 
who were "on the other side", and reports what they are saying. After 
a while there come initials and names, and he is interested to hear 
some rather unusual family nicknames. As the hour progresses, the 
sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific 
statements. There are a few prognoses of coming events. ## 

ANOTHER MEDIUM, another sitter, would produce a somewhat different 
content, but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing 
reading. Some mediums speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while 
others may stress the spiritual. Not all, as a matter of fact, consider 
themselves "mediums" in the sense of receiving messages from 
the deceased. In fact, some sensitives rule this out, preferring to 
consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception 
(~ESP), 
on this side of the "veil". However that may be, people are 
known to go to mediums for diverse reasons. Perhaps they are mourning 
a recent death and want comfort, to feel in touch with the deceased, 
or seek indications for future plans. They may, of course, be curiosity 
seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.

The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation 
is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated 
state, so that the sitter can make comments, ask and answer questions, 
instead of talking with a "control" who speaks through an 
entranced sensitive. What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary 
conversation.   But it is not really only a conversation. 
Many a sitter (in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize that 
the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind. He himself 
might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent, 
unspecified, semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she 
described it to him! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability 
to put a finger on "pre-conscious" moods and to clarify them.

However, in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium, 
he did not receive a personal reading. Instead he brought with 
him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium 
knew nothing. For this was to be a "proxy sitting". ##

AS 
WAS NOTED earlier, it is important that in valid, objective study of 
this sort of communication, the interested sitter should be separated 
from the sensitive. Dr& Karlis Osis, Director of Research at 
the Parapsychology Foundation, described the basis for the experiment 
in a TOMORROW article, ("New Research on Survival After 
Death", Spring 1958). He remarked: "It has been clearly established 
that in a number of instances the message did not come from a 
spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter".

The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ~ESP 
may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this, the two central 
characters in this drama must be separated.   One way to do 
this is by "proxy sittings", wherein the person seeking a message 
does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute, 
the proxy sitter. If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter 
except his name (given by the experimenter), he cannot possibly 
give any clues, conscious or unconscious, far less ask leading questions. 
All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner, seeking 
to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal 
impressions.   Sometimes in these experiments "appointment 
sittings" are used. Here the absent sitter makes a "date" 
with a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased), asking him 
to "come in" at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for 
him. In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator, 
nothing else. He gives this to the medium at the appointed 
time, and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages 
from the communicator. As always, a tape recording or detailed 
notes are made, and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.

So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier 
between the medium's ~ESP and the absent sitter's mind. It 
is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though 
research still does not know how far afield ~ESP <can> range. 
##

NOW THE ORIGINAL absent sitter must decide whether the 
statements are meaningful to <him>. Here again laboratory approaches 
are being evolved, for it is recognized how "elastic" these readings 
can be, how they can apply to many people, and are often stated 
in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case. 
If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you will probably 
see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you, 
even when you were not in the picture at all! An interested sitter 
may think the sensitive has made a "hit", describing something accurately 
for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter, hearing 
the same statement, would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances? 
It is, of course, easy to see how "~J" will mean 
Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another. "A journey", 
"a 
little white house", "a change of outlook", can apply to many 
people. And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform 
to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal. One sitter 
may think "a leather couch" identifies a reading as surely directed 
to him; to another, it seems that nobody but his father ever 
used the phrase, "Atta boy"!   To get around this quite difficult 
corner, there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the 
distant sitter from knowing which reading <was> for him. If he is 
not told which of four or five readings was meant for him, he can more 
readily assess each item in a larger frame: "Does that statement 
really sound as if it were for me, significant in my particular life? 
Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody, 
and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar 
experience"?   Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive 
such statements as the following, which, if they turned out 
to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:   "He 
had four children, two sets of twins. After being a lawyer for twenty-five 
years he started studying for the ministry. Part of his house 
had been moved to the other side of the road. He died of typhoid in 
1921".   Methods have been developed of assigning "weights" 
to statements; that is, it is known empirically that names beginning 
with ~R are more common than those beginning with ~Z; that 
fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth; that in the United 
States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox. So each reading 
can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these 
weights. Specific dates would be important, as would double names. 
Various categories have been explored to find out about these "empirical 
probabilities" against which to measure the readings. ##

IN 
THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION'S long-range experiment, readings 
are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating 
sitters, trying to throw light on this question of the significance 
of mediumistic statements. It is very important indeed, in the field 
of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis, 
to know whether the statements are actually only those which any 
intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself. 
Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated, facts which are 
in themselves significant and <not> easily applicable to everybody? 
That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.

So, after the sitting has been held, several readings at one time 
are mailed, and the distant sitter (whose name or whose communicator's 
name was given to the medium) must mark each little item as Correct 
(Hit), Incorrect (Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant (applying 
to him and, he feels, not to anyone else). He is required to 
mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his. 
All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated, by adding 
up the Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those in the 
sitter's own reading. That is, if he marks as most correct a reading 
<not> meant for him, the total experimental score falls.   Conversely, 
if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading, and finds more 
accurate facts in it than in the others, a point is chalked up for 
the intrinsic, objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material. 
And there are some positive results, though the final findings 
will not be known for a long time- and then further research can 
be formulated.   In another approach to the same procedure, the 
content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium 
is likely to slant her statements. Does she often speak of locations, 
of cause of death? Does she accurately give dates, ages, kind 
of occupation? It is possible to find out in which categories most 
of her correct statements fall, and where she makes most of her "hits". 
Now when, so to speak, the cream has been skimmed off, and the 
items in the successful categories separated out, the sitter can be asked 
to consider and rate only this concentrated "cream", where the 
sensitive is at her best. ##

MEDIUMISTIC IMPRESSIONS are evidently 
of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses. "I feel cold", 
the medium says, or "My leg aches", "My head is heavy". 
Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: "There's such a noise 
of loud machinery", or "I hear a child crying", or "He says 
we're all here and glad to see you". Maybe an entire scene comes 
into consciousness, with action and motion, or a static view: "a 
house under a pine tree, with a little stone path going up to the door". 
The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors, too, or subjectively 
feels emotions. Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery 
and seems to see all details in perspective, as if the scene were actually 
there. If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she may be able 
to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply, almost 
as if she were physically going closer.   If asked how she gets 
her impressions, she probably can only say that she "just gets them"- 
some more vividly than others. Perhaps this is not so extraordinary 
after all. Even in normal experience one gets impressions without 
knowing exactly how- of atmosphere, of one another's personalities, 
moods, intentions.   Of course, there is an element of training 
here: these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance, 
have 
learned to develop their power. Simply <using> it increases its intensity, 
I was told by one sensitive.   Nor does a medium automatically 
know how to interpret her imagery. Impressions often appear in 
a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value. It is apparently 
by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious, and the medium 
has to translate these into meaning. If communication with an entity 
on the "other side" is taking place, this too may assume the form 
of clairvoyant symbolism.   During one reading an image appeared 
of a prisoner in irons. But this did not necessarily refer to an 
actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state 
of mental or spiritual confinement. In this connection it is worth 
noting how names are sometimes obtained. Though they are often heard 
clairaudiently, as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they 
are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name 
"Hill", for instance. One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line 
and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter. 
_@_ Farming is confining. The farmer's life must be arranged 
to meet the demands of crops and livestock.   Livestock must be 
tended every day, routinely. A slight change in the work schedule may 
cut the production of cows or chickens.   Even if there are no 
livestock, the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods, particularly 
during the growing season.   The worker who lives on a farm 
cannot change jobs readily. He cannot leave the farm to take work 
in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of 
capital. _@_ Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part 
of farm life. The farmer must get up early, and, at times, work late 
at night. Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold 
rain. No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected 
setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.   It may 
not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery 
that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably. _@_ Production 
may fall far below expectations. Drought, hail, disease, and insects 
take their toll of crops. Sickness or loss of some of the livestock 
may cut into the owner's earnings, even into his capital. _@_ 
Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good 
year.   The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult 
to farm profitably on a part-time basis. Land within commuting 
distance of a growing city is usually high in price, higher if it has 
subdivision possibilities. Part-time farmers generally must pay higher 
prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller 
quantities. If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high, 
farm labor costs will also be high.   A part-time farmer needs 
unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre 
as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer. It will frequently 
be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment. He 
may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations, 
such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his 
turn. There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he 
is away at his off-farm job. _@_ The farm may be an additional 
burden if the main job is lost. This may be true whether the farm is 
owned or rented.   If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid. 
If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free 
of mortgage, there will be interest and 
payments on the principal to take care of. _ADVANTAGES_ _@_A 
farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children. 
It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air. The children can 
do chores adapted to their age and ability. Caring for a calf, a pig, 
or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for 
work. _@_ Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the 
regular job is lost, <provided> the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes 
enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs. 
_@_ For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way 
to supplement retirement income. It is particularly suitable for those 
who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health. _@_ 
Generally, the s 
ame level of living costs less in the country than 
in the city. The savings are not as great, however, as is sometime supposed. 
Usually, the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on 
the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more. 
Where schools, fire and police protection, and similar municipal services 
are of equal quality in city and country, real estate taxes are 
usually about the same. _@_ A part-time farmer and his family can 
use their spare time profitably. _@_ Some persons consider the 
work on a farm recreational. For some white-collar workers it is a 
welcome change from the regular job, and a physical conditioner. 

#LAND, 
LABOR, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED#

Part-time farming can take comparatively 
little land, labor, and equipment- or a great deal. It depends 
on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.   General 
requirements for land, labor, and equipment are discussed below. Specific 
requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed 
on pages 8 to 14. _LAND_ Three quarters to 1 acre of good land 
is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a 
small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs. You could not, of course, 
raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.   If you 
want to 
raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll 
need more land.   In deciding how much land you want, take into 
account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect. But 
consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your 
other work. The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in 
value may influence your decision. Some part-time farmers buy more 
land than they need in anticipation of suburban development. This is 
a highly speculative venture.   Sometimes a desired acreage is offered 
only as part of a larger tract. When surplus land is not expensive 
to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy 
so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might 
impair the residential value of the farm. _LABOR_ If you have a 
year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your 
family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of 
the work or you hire help. As a rule, part-time farmers hire little 
help.   In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor, 
compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with 
the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.   List 
the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month. 
You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have 
one. Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare 
time- only what you are willing to use for farm work. _EQUIPMENT_ 
If you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only 
hand tools. You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing, 
however.   For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power 
for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating. If you have a planting 
of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor 
(available for $300 to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices). These 
tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier 
soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.

Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the 
small-scale farmer. If you are going to farm for extra cash income on 
a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments 
when you choose among farm enterprises.   You can keep your 
machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing 
the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring 
someone with machinery to do certain jobs. If an expensive and specialized 
piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig, a combine, 
or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work. 

#SELECTING A FARM#

Before you look for a farm you'll need 
to know (1) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and 
(2) 
whether you want to buy or rent.   Information on pages 8 to 14 
may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.

If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish 
to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like 
and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent 
a place for a year or two before you buy.   Discussed below are 
some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm. 
_LOCATION_ _NEARNESS TO WORK.-_ Choose a location within easy 
commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities. 
Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell 
the farm. The presence of alternative job opportunities also will 
make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable. 
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road. _NEARNESS TO 
MARKETS.-_ If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby. 
If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example, 
you should be close to a town or city. _KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-_ 
Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes. There are slums 
in the country as well as in the city. Few rural areas are protected 
by zoning. A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, 
or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to 
hurt its value. _FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-_ Check on the schools 
in the area, the quality of teaching, and the provision for transportation 
to and from them.   Find out whether fire protection, sewage 
system, gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available in the 
locality. If these facilities are not at the door, getting them may 
cost more than you expect. You may have to provide them yourself or 
get along without them.   You cannot get along without an adequate 
supply of pure water. If you are considering a part-time farm where 
the water must be provided by a well, find out if there is a good well 
on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled. A pond may 
provide adequate water for livestock and garden. Pond water can be filtered 
for human use, but most part-time farmers would not want to go 
to so much trouble. The following amounts of water are needed per day 
for livestock and domestic uses. _TOPOGRAPHY AND SOIL_ Is the land 
suited to the crops you intend to raise? If you can't tell, get 
help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist. 
Soil type, drainage, or degree of slope can make the difference between 
good crops and poor ones. Small areas that aren't right for a certain 
crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop. _THE 
HOUSE_ Will the house on any part-time farm you are considering 
make a satisfactory full-time residence? How much will it cost to 
do any necessary modernizing and redecorating? If the house is not 
wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating 
system must be installed, check into the cost of making these improvements. 

#BUYING A FARM#

The value of the farm to you will depend 
on- _@_ Its worth as a place to live. _@_ The value of 
the products you can raise on it. _@_ The possibilities of selling 
the property later on for suburban subdivision.   Decide first 
what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison 
with what it would cost to live in town. Take into account the difference 
in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility rates, and 
the cost of travel to work.   Next, estimate the value of possible 
earnings of the farm. To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating 
the farm. List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be 
expected to produce in an average year. Estimate the value of the produce 
at normal prices. The total is the probable gross income from farming.

To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated 
annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming. Include 
as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings 
and equipment. Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be 
contributed by the family. It may be hard to decide what this labor 
is worth, but charge something for it. Otherwise, you may pay too much 
for the farm and get nothing for your labor.   To figure the 
value of the farm in terms of investment income, divide the estimated 
annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get 
in interest if the money were invested in some other way. 
Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his 
day in court as in some vast collective dirge. For almost two months, 
the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the 
grave about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents, babies, starved, 
beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned, gassed, burned. One 
who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected 
by height for the gas chambers. The gruesome humor of the Nazis 
was not forgotten- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name 
of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David- nor 
the gratuitous sadism of ~SS officers. Public relations strategists 
everywhere, watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal 
press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their neighbors, studying 
interviews with men and women on the street, cried out: Too much, 
too much- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors 
are losing their effect. And still another witness, one who had crawled 
out from under a heap of corpses, had to tell how the victims had 
been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before 
being shot. **h   Most of this testimony may have been legally 
admissible as bearing on the <corpus delicti> of the total Nazi 
crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it 
of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs. Counsel for the 
defense, however, shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current 
of dreadful recollections, rarely raised an objection. Would not the 
emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming, 
if not exhausting, effect likely to improve his client's chances? 
Those who feared "emotionalism" at the Trial showed less 
understanding than Dr& Servatius of the route by which man achieves 
the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies. Interruptions 
came 
largely from the bench, which numerous times rebuked the Attorney 
General for letting his witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious 
effort to choke off the flow.   But there was a contrast even 
more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem 
and those in Moscow and New York. In each of the last, the trial 
<marked the beginning of a new course:> in Moscow the liquidation 
of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship; 
in the United States the initiation of militant anti-Communism, 
with the repentant ex-Communist in the vanguard. These trials were 
properly termed "political cases" in that the trial itself was 
a political act producing political consequences. But what could the 
Eichmann Trial initiate? Of what new course could it mark the beginning? 
The Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future. 
It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection, 
and of refining the recollection, that will last as long as there 
are Jews. As such, it was beyond politics and had no need of justification 
by a "message". ##

"IT IS NOT AN individual 
that is in the dock at this historical trial"- said Ben Gurion, 
"and not the Nazi regime alone- but anti-Semitism throughout 
history". How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to 
maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews 
<without being an anti-Semite> contribute to a verdict against anti-Semitism? 
And if it was not an individual who was in the dock, why 
was the Trial, as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the 
attempt to prove Eichmann a "fiend"? These questions touch the 
root of confusion in the prosecution's case.   It might be contended, 
of course, that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic 
feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-Semitism. 
But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined 
by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment. In such a case 
the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied 
to the issue by argument. One who could be linked to anti-Semitism 
only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the 
Jew-baiter throughout the ages. Shout at Eichmann though he might, 
the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying 
the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally 
recognized category of anti-Semitism. Yes, he believed that the 
Jews were "enemies of the Reich", and such a belief is, of course, 
typical of "patriotic" anti-Semites; but he believed in the 
Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member 
of a cult speculating on the nature of things. The real question was 
how one passed from anti-Semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer 
to this question is not to be found in anti-Semitism itself. In 
regard to Eichmann, 
it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained 
a principle separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism, a 
principle by which the poison of anti-Semitism itself was made more virulent. 
Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could, 
as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the 
Jews and still be their murderer. Not through fear of disobeying orders, 
as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness 
that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained 
in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's 
victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical 
rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous 
the better, "Well, let's try it". At any rate, the substance 
of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from 
his membership in the party and the ~SS, and though the Prosecutor 
did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success 
on this score was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson weakened to 
that extent. ##

BUT IF THE Trial did not expose the special 
Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened 
to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary 
anti-Semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany 
and wherever else they could find it. If anti-Semitism was on trial 
in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis 
to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the 
activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified 
by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-Semites 
in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary? 
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 
1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death 
the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was 
attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including 
the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in 
charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the 
Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The measures for annihilation 
proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation, 
civilian agencies of government. Heydrich, in opening the Conference, 
followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order 
issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as 
" a complement to" previous "solutions" for eliminating the Jews 
from German living space through violence, economic strangulation, 
forced emigration, and evacuation. In other words, the promulgators 
of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews 
was but an extension of the anti-Semitic measures already operating 
in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on 
the general anti-Semitism that had made those measures effective, as 
a readiness for murder. This, in fact, it turned out to be. Since 
the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had 
began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions, 
and armed forces became, through their anti-Semitism or their 
tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes; whether 
in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.

What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn 
the world against anti-Semitism than this opportunity to expose the 
exact link between the respectable anti-Semite and the concentration-camp 
brute? Not in Eichmann's anti-Semitism but in the anti-Semitism 
of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning 
of the Trial. No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had 
conceived their anti-Semitism as an "innocent" dislike of Jews, 
as do others like them today. The Final Solution proved that the 
Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the 
criminality and madness of others. Ought not an edifying Trial have 
made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how 
representative types of "mere" anti-Semites were drawn step by 
step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings? The Prosecutor 
in his opening remarks did refer to "the germ of anti-Semitism" 
among the Germans which Hitler "stimulated and transformed". But 
if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's 
head 
at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press 
seems to have missed it. ##

NOR DID THE Trial devote much 
attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-Semitism to the Nazis, 
both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations 
and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the 
world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous 
weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew 
can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society 
into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know 
enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in 
the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting 
apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest 
impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally 
forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them 
partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial 
a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful 
of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform; 
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of 
politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent 
to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania 
and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you 
desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this 
characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor, 
more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a 
political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission 
of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed 
to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which 
the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&, 
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it 
met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, 
France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an 
outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism 
proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose 
citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't 
this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries 
worth highlighting? 
##

AS THE FIRST collective confrontation 
of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery 
of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen 
years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one 
believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance 
of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to 
recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to 
the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were 
unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had 
been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and 
investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors' 
accounts. 
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital 
presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the 
Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff. 
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of 
protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace 
of the community 
was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the 
incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's 
Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide 
a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated 
a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman 
Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board 
of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year 
later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an 
orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood 
Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were 
embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's 
right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents, 
typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no 
controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension, 
rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control 
issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of 
newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in 
municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted 
on the national level in the matter of including birth-control 
information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where 
it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment 
like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The 
time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove 
this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life 
of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment 
of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication 
on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination, 
loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study 
of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more 
serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is 
reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara, 
managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over 
Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the 
reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their 
jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed 
in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly 
harsh.

The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement- 
frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting- 
already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the 
over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being 
obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number 
of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible> 
parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents 
will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope 
Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from 
the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the 
whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as 
those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and 
social "indications". This means that such factors as the health 
of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their 
children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density 
of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately 
be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.

These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics 
in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control 
only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however, 
sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics, 
Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of 
family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman 
Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also 
known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers 
this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author: 
It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent 
and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman 
Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no 
moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives, 
allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in 
theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The 
grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament), 
the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the 
unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest 
ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent 
role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive, 
entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of 
birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition 
regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of 
the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual 
love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion 
is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason 
can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known 
His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus, 
man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal 
act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man 
may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by 
God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for 
the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this 
law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are 
obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let 
it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between 
Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But 
people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without 
taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it 
so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has 
sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation 
and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical 
consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation 
for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant 
one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint 
upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed 
to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during 
World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the 
Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe 
that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically 
evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants 
forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general 
public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that 
the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt 
to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, 
hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled 
in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an 
inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience 
shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced 
when it has little correspondence with the general view of society. 
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control 
today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned 
by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary 
to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian 
countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches 
stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth 
Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual 
change that has taken place among Protestants generally. 
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception 
and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural 
means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers- 
physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against 
the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing 
the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference 
declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded 
as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the 
primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance 
of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is 
the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful 
self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against 
the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth 
Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be 
the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances, 
contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958, 
the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by 
God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations 
preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out 
of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified 
artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity", 
the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the 
size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control 
of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement 
also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression 
of mutual affection <without> relation to procreation is right".

Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate 
pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared 
it at times to be a <religious duty>. What determines the morality, 
they state, is not the <means> used, but the <motive>. In 
general, the means (excluding abortion) that prove most effective are 
considered the most ethical.   This development is reflected in 
the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the 
National 
Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the 
~US. The board approved and commended the use of birth-control 
devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning. It 
called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting 
the information or availability of contraceptives.   The general 
board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold contraception 
and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are 
right **h. The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather 
than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are 
limited to the prevention of conception".   An action once universally 
condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil 
law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant 
denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive 
<religious duty>. This viewpoint has now been translated into 
action by the majority of people in this country. Repeated polls have 
disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the 
practice of birth control.   For all concerned with social-welfare 
legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary 
change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American 
people is clear, profound and far-reaching. To try to oppose the general 
religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative 
fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was 
occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.   This brings 
us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in 
the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion: 
They are moral judgments and matters of theological belief. 
Conscience and religion are concerned with private <sin:> The civil 
law is concerned with public <crimes>. Only confusion, failure 
and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority 
the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the 
possibility of sin. Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived 
imposition would be religion itself.

On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, <Discovery>, 
weighed anchor in St& Katherine's Pool, London, and 
floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain, 
a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration 
of the Arctic waters of North America.   Seventeen months later, 
on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the <Discovery> 
limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port, 
she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The 
captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded 
her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.   What disaster 
struck the <Discovery> during those seventeen months? What happened 
to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained 
one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the 
evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal, 
(2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note 
found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand 
reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture.   But 
since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal 
files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not 
enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate 
picture of the events of the voyage.   Historians have had 
two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First, 
they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed 
it important to determine the fate of the captain- a man whose 
name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, 
on a great American river, and on half a million square miles 
of Arctic seas.   The name: <Henry Hudson>.   This 
is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able- or 
ever, probably, will be able- to determine:   The sailing in 
the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time 
his objective had been the same- a direct water passage from Western 
Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy 
Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole 
or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy 
Company indicated it would not back him again.   In 1609, the 
Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, 
fitted him out with a ship called the <Half Moon>, and supplied 
him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the 
middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important- 
the Great North (later, the Hudson) River- but it produced 
no northwest passage. ##

When the <Half Moon> put in at 
Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings 
leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government 
forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went 
to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime, 
he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage 
of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran 
ship called the <Discovery> and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, 
the largest he had ever commanded.   The purpose of this 
fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that 
a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe 
and 
the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a 
passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's 
sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.

But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to 
the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had 
noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the 
water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides". He 
named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious 
Overfall". (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.)

In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little <Discovery> that 
Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his 
frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all 
the 
way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.

Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he 
was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous, 
ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely 
such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain. 
On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of 
Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that 
he did so of his own free will- which was obviously not the case. On 
the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch 
and English crew members on the <Half Moon> had almost forced him 
to head the ship back to Amsterdam in mid-Atlantic.   Worse, 
his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before. Of 
only one could he be sure- young John Hudson, his second son. The 
mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the <half Moon>, 
was experienced- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or 
desert at any opportunity. Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was 
a good worker, but perversely independent. Arnold Lodley and Michael 
Perse were like the rest- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson 
in a crisis.   But men willing to sail at all into waters where 
wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find. Hudson 
knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer. And 
he refused to be anything else.   It is believed that Hudson 
was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was 
trained 
on company ships. He was a Londoner, married, with three sons. 
(The common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name 
was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.) In 1610, 
Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn 
voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession. 
##

Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a 
few miles down the Thames. There at the river's edge waited one Henry 
Greene, whom Hudson listed as a "clerk". Greene was in actuality 
a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in 
order to keep the company he preferred- pimps, panders and whores. 
He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board 
and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the <Discovery> picked 
him up.   For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the 
east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward. On May 11, she 
reached Iceland. Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the 
crew called "Lousie Bay". The subsequent two-weeks wait made the 
crew quarrelsome. With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked 
a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson. The issue was 
settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined 
to catch the next fishing boat back to England. With difficulty, 
Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland. 
##

Early in June, the <Discovery> passed "Desolation" 
(southern Greenland) and in mid-June entered the "Furious Overfall". 
Floating ice bore down from the north and west. Fog hung 
over the route constantly. Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet. 
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic 
North Pole.   As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was 
forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the 
great strait. After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he 
turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway- and the 
crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.   The trouble 
was at least partly Juet's doing. For weeks he had been saying that 
Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd. The great, 
crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice 
of pure reason. A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would 
sail no farther.   Instead of quelling the dissension, as many 
captains of the era would have done (Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's 
head off under similar circumstances), Hudson decided to be reasonable. 
He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which 
he set up in view of the crew. Patiently, he explained what he knew 
about their course and their objectives.   When Hudson had finished, 
the "town meeting" broke down into a general, wordy 
argument. 
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety 
of them to be back in England. Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who 
said he wouldn't give <ten> pounds to be home. The statement was 
effective. The meeting broke up. Hudson was free to sail on. ## 

All through July the <Discovery> picked her way along the 450-mile-long 
strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands. On August 3, two massive 
headlands reared out of the mists- great gateways never before, 
so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans. To starboard was a cape 
a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands 
of screaming sea birds. To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind 
to a precipice of 2,000 feet. Hudson named the capes Digges and 
Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.   Hudson pointed the <Discovery> 
down the east coast of the newly discovered sea (now called 
Hudson Bay), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the 
Pacific. After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered 
an area of shallow marshes and river deltas. The ship halted. The 
great "sea to the westwards" was a dead end.   This must have 
been Hudson's blackest discovery. For he seemed to sense at once 
that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North 
American continent. This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to 
know he was destined to failure.   Feverishly, he tried to brush 
away this intuition. North and south, east and west, back and forth 
he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land 
appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after 
week. Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England 
through the "Furious Overfall" was again filling with ice.

The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking. 
Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest. Hudson's reply 
was to accuse the mate of disloyalty. Juet demanded that Hudson prove 
his charges in an open trial.   The trial was held September 
10. Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony 
from crew members. Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men 
stepped forward. Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe 
swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords 
in their cabins. Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted 
bloodshed on the ship. Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the 
ship homeward.   Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay. The new 
mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced. There were other 
shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves. 
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis 
Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.

As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little 
bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him. Once, 
after the <Discovery> lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered 
the anchor raised before the sea had calmed. Just as it was being 
hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship. Michael Butt and Adame Moore 
were thrown off the capstan and badly injured. The anchor cable would 
have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever 
it with his axe.

Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian 
Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands, 
conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River 
of the North. Since the land he desired lay within the great northern 
empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of 
the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies. Having 
achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the 
valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The grant, which stretched 
southward to Lake Traverse- the headwaters of the Red- was 
made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots 
was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Thus 
at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify 
the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle 
of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the 
center of the North American continent to the west of the American 
agricultural frontier.   Seven hundred miles south of York Factory, 
at "the Forks" of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three 
men located a settlement in August 1812. By October the little 
colony about Fort Douglas (present-day Winnipeg) numbered 100. Within 
a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring 
the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called <Meurons>. 
The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported 
by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the 
War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of 
the war in 1815. Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go 
to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect 
his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the 
intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire. The mercenaries 
were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of 
the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 
1818.   It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages 
of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement 
southward. When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was 
assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and <metis> moved up 
the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river. Here they built huts and 
a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland. 
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer 
to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for 
food.   The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move 
southward by British fur traders. For many years the Northwest Company 
had its southern headquarters at Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi 
River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St& Paul, 
Minnesota. When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm 
out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American 
citizens- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly- 
continued in the fur business. On Big Stone Lake near the 
headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of 
the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned 
in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small 
artillery pieces. His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks 
of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south 
in carts. These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days 
of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk 
colony was begun. In 1802 Henry referred to "our new carts" as 
being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as 
a horse could pack. They were held together by pegs and withes and 
in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.   It was Dickson 
who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast 
by way of the United States. In September 1817 at Fort Daer (Pembina) 
Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux, 
he escorted to Prairie du Chien. During the trip Selkirk decided 
that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern 
United States was the best route for goods from England to reach 
Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply 
for many goods than either Canada or England. Upon arriving at 
Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams, 
Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade 
with "Missouri and Illinois Territories". This traffic, he 
declared prophetically, "tho' it might be of small account at first, 
would increase with the progress of our Settlements **h". 
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop 
into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might 
have expected. In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at "the 
Forks" (Fort Douglas) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort 
Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie du Chien. 
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three 
months of labor on Mackinac boats. With these completed and ice 
gone from the St& Peter's River (present-day Minnesota river) 
their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels 
of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats 
and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse, 
and down the Red. They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820. This 
epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk @1,040. 
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were 
forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food. Thereafter seed and food became 
more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.

Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony 
on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send 
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 
300 miles northwest of Prairie du Chien, until then the most advanced 
United States post. In September 1822 two companies of infantry 
arrived at the mouth of the St& Peter's River, the head of navigation 
on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St& 
Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander, 
Colonel Josiah Snelling.   It was from the American outposts 
that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good. Hercules 
L& Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted 
to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and 
Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers. Bailly, 
after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave 
some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake 
Traverse "in the Sieux Country" and reached Fort Garry, as the 
Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the 
fall. He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families 
of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward 
the United States. Observing their distressing condition, Colonel 
Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military 
reservation.   As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk 
settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman 
of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie du Chien was traveling 
to Red River to open a trade in merchandise. Early in 1822 he was 
at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco. 
Alexander McDonnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird, 
a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such "sundry 
articles" to a value of @4,500.   For its part the Hudson's 
Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement. 
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-American frontier 
by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the 
Pembina colony- its own post and Fort Daer- was on American 
territory. Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move 
north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating 
the timber to "the Forks" in rafts. "I have done everything", 
he wrote, "to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment 
**h". Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut 
off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350 
persons stayed in the village. They would attempt to bring supplies 
from St& Louis or Prairie du Chien at "great expense as well 
as danger".   At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided 
to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families 
paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling. The disasters of 1825-1826 
caused more to leave. After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, 
snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through 
a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick. In April 
came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until 
mid-June. On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month 
trip across the plains to the Mississippi. By fall, 443 survivors 
of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but 
most of them were sent on to Galena and St& Louis, with a few going 
as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United 
States. In 1837, 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were 
living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.   Below the fort, 
high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi 
River. At the point where they ended, another settlement grew 
up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier 
in 1840. Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American 
Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were 
joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major 
Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840. 
The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father 
Galtier's mission, St& Paul, was to become an important center 
of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers 
who remained at Red River.   While population at Fort 
Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic 
opportunities did not increase at a similar rate. Accordingly, though 
the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter 
which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the 
Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade. The Company 
maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased 
and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they 
refrain from trading in furs. Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some 
of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs. 
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed 
a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed 
as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power". 
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's 
local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding 
any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source 
of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men 
to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried 
pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St& 
Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells, 
transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This 
trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, 
but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty 
was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.

The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow 
in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel. 
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer 
humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in 
the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some 
of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate 
observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen 
and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were 
"in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house". 
A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".

Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One 
wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse + 
snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses 
in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times". 
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved 
about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches 
on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity 
of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and 
sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following 
description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse 
girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h 
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from 
the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression. 
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become 
of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my 
love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell, 
an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved 
in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked 
to 
tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about 
a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive 
letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married 
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar 
as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as 
I am 
so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote: 
"I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another 
Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down 
to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite 
before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"". 
Charles 
Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his 
comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation, 
well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like 
his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his 
service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups, 
name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and 
then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and 
'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file 
of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and 
wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most 
common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities 
referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but 
a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier 
stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough 
as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs 
from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer 
to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering 
from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier 
gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence 
of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three 
days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack 
and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother: 
"I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear 
and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters 
which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances. 
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers 
rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of 
the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of 
bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of 
the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many 
Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing 
from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the 
sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously 
written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing 
about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, 
stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced 
writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we 
take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed 
his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often 
**h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just 
count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every 
time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta 
reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they 
will knock over my ink, so I will close". #/3,#

The most 
common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But 
fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and 
these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing 
of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include 
in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro 
community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the 
war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro 
"body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging, 
cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes. 
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters 
of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members 
of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on 
correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages 
characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were 
stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally 
gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about 
their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or 
Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier 
whose 
feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully 
of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout 
I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it 
all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five 
of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I 
recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they 
would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk". 
Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who, 
from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment 
on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself 
thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was 
a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having 
any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse **h. 
I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf 
dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed card playing Sun 
of a bich com to Sea you, the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode 
helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as 
i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from 
soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions. 
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his 
first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting 
yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they 
brok + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches 
and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit 
Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers 
in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi 
soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain, 
stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry 
is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation 
of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to 
tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H& 
Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees 
from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a 
private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton 
and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head 
cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps 
**h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow 
their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point 
graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments 
about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers. 
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War 
version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves 
as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks 
**h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten 
cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George 
Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My 
own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended 
long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I 
wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging 
them against [the other half]".   No group of officers 
came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal 
soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde 
with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after 
the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank 
wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital 
for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed- 
thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union 
quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward 
each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut 
of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to 
a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey 
+ gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier 
wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw 
they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h". 
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote 
in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right 
**h found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe 
their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise 
with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would 
be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing 
from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama 
Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that 
my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid 
at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of 
cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty **h. 
THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION 
to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism 
in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence 
across the world. Thus, if we are to observe American folklore 
in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships 
between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.

Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism 
and international influence. 1) Every age rewrites the events 
of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends 
about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary 
actions. What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important 
as what a given generation feels must have occurred. 2) As a country 
superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches 
its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness. Its folklore 
and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account 
for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to 
become a cohesive force for national identification.   One can apply 
these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be 
applied again to the United States in more recent years. The popularity 
of local color literature before the Spanish-American War, the 
steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the 
frontier west in our mass media are cases in point. Nor is it an accident 
that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years, 
has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such 
as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical 
Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature, 
American civilization, American anything have swept our school 
and college curricula.   Of course, nationalism has really 
outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its 
continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the 
twentieth-century 
United States. Yet nationalism has lost few of its 
charms for the historian, writer or man in the street. It is an understandable 
paradox that most American history and most American literature 
is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic 
point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion 
over palm and pine. After all, the average American as he lies and 
waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain 
hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or 
her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental 
actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control. 
Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether 
warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense 
emotional involvement. Such identification comes for each group in each 
crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate 
national heroes.   In America, such self-deception has served 
a particularly useful purpose. A heterogeneous people have needed it 
to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and 
ever-changing 
land. But we must never forget, most of the appropriate 
heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs, 
almost always with conscious aims and ends. Parson Weems's George 
Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of 
the uniting States. Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of 
the national Constitution. Robert E& Lee represented the dignity 
needed by a rebelling confederacy. And their roles are paralleled by 
those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett, 
Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.   Therefore, the 
scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years, 
will be mindful of two facts. 1) Most of the legends that are created 
to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are 
not folk legends at all. 2) The concept that an "American national 
folklore" exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.

Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group 
of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission. It 
has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions, 
rhymes and such literary forms of expression. Related to 
written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written 
form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral 
existence. Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies, 
it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.

In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our 
folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as 
this. Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus 
materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor 
union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition. Nor 
have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of 
isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did 
not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education 
and industrialization 
had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as 
a means of carrying culturally significant material.   Naturally, 
such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make 
money or fan patriotism by means of folklore. That much of what he 
calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people 
with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction 
to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant. As long 
as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses 
and appears "democratic" to his audience, he remains satisfied.

From all this we can now see that two streams of development 
run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore. On 
the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained 
in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected 
and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic, 
regional and occupational groups that make up this nation. On the other 
we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been 
willing to use any patriotic, "frontier western" or colonial material 
willy-nilly. Unfortunately, few of the artists (writers, movie 
producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore 
since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams 
even in the most general of ways. After all, the field is large, difficult 
to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates. 
In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many 
heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of 
print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society. 
The problems confuse even the experts.   For that matter, 
the experts themselves are a mixed breed. Anthropologists, housewives, 
historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline 
as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination 
of the four. They have widely varying backgrounds and aims. 
They have little "esprit de corps".   The outlook for the 
amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local 
history or for the picturesque. His love of folklore has romanticism 
in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote. 
Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain 
as such. The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is 
actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field. The collector 
enjoys the contact with rural life; he hunts folklore for the 
very "field and stream" reasons that many persons hunt game; and 
only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has 
located. Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector, 
are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between 
real folklore and bogus material.   But there are also the commercial 
propagandists and the analysts- one dominated by money, the other 
by nineteenth-century German scholarship. Both are primarily concerned 
with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector 
has found. Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond 
the sewage system and the electric light lines. The commercial propagandist, 
who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the 
amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's 
toes by refusing to keep his material genuine. His standards are, 
of course, completely foreign to those of the analyst. To both the amateur 
and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation 
with his endless probings and classifications. Dominated by 
the vicious circle of the university promotion system, the analyst looks 
down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups, although 
he cannot deny his debt to the collector.   The knowledge that 
most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial 
propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors. The work 
done by the analysts, the men who really know what folklore is all about, 
has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort 
and reaches a limited, learned audience. Publishers want books that 
will sell, recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to 
ears used to hillbilly and jazz music, grade and high schools want quaint, 
but moral, material. The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit 
in. As a result, most people don't have more than a vague idea what 
folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming, moral 
legends and patriotic anecdotes, with a superstition or remedy thrown 
in here and there. And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur 
and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the 
hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment 
and nationalism alone.   If one wishes to discuss a literary 
figure who uses folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize 
is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American 
public. And while every writer must be dealt with as a special 
case, the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions 
about each. Does the writer know the difference between an "ersatz" 
ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk? When 
the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial 
effect or does he leave it pure? Is the writer propagandistic? 
Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was? 
Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American 
attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they 
may be?   When he gets the answers to his questions he will be 
discouraged. In the first place, a good many writers who are said to 
use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional superstition or 
tale. Robert Frost, for instance, writes about rural life in New England, 
but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in 
his poems. This has not, however, prevented publishers from labeling 
him a "folk poet", simply because he is a rural one. In the second 
place, a large number of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost 
to being "folk writers" of one sort or another, clearly make 
no distinctions between genuine and bogus material. Stephen Vincent 
Benet's <John Brown's Body> comes immediately to mind in this 
connection, as does John Steinbeck's <The Grapes of Wrath> 
and Carl Sandburg's <The People, Yes>. The last two writers 
introduce strong political bias into their works, and not unlike the union 
leaders that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir of 
protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass. Folklore, as 
used by such writers, really reflects images engraved into it by the very 
person using it. The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect 
to nation or political attitude. In fact, there is much evidence to 
indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular 
regional, ethnic and occupational limits. Nevertheless, with a reading 
public that longs for the "good old days" and with an awareness 
of our expanding international interests, it is easy for the Benets 
to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of 
Americana, real or fake, and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs 
to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform 
into the minds of the folk. 
As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the spirit of peace 
and good will, and in exchange for armed support in the April election 
campaign, bestowed upon O'Banion a third share in the Hawthorne 
Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade. The coalition 
was to prove inadvisable.   O'Banion was a complex and frightening 
man, whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour 
into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a 
jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets 
into someone's body. He carried three guns- one in the right 
trouser pocket, one under his left armpit, one in the left outside coat 
pocket- and was equally lethal with both hands. He killed accurately, 
freely, and dispassionately. The police credited him with twenty-five 
murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them. 
Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He was an expert 
florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths. 
He had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity 
into "right guys" and "wrong guys", and the wrong ones he 
was always willing to kill and trample under. He had what was described 
by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality". He walked with a heavy 
list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other, 
but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns. Landesco 
thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly" but he was, 
in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference 
to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also 
at this time, although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets 
as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and most dangerous mob 
leader in the Chicago underworld, the roughneck king.   O'Banion 
was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer, 
in the North Side's Little Hell, close by the Sicilian quarter 
and Death Corner. He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral 
and also served as an acolyte to Father O'Brien. The influence 
of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum tenements 
among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust saloons of his birthplace; 
he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood, and 
went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging, 
and housebreaking. At the age of ten, when he was working as 
a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted 
in his permanently shortened leg. Because of this he was known as 
Gimpy (but, as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in 
his presence). In his teens O'Banion was enrolled in the vicious 
Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in McGovern's 
Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street, where 
befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing 
waiters before being thrown out. He then got a job with the Chicago 
<Herald-Examiner> as a circulation slugger, a rough fighter 
employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon 
by rival vendors. He was also at the same time gaining practical 
experience as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how to shoot 
to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary, later 
committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes 
misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish 
mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.   O'Banion's first conflict 
with the police came in 1909, at seventeen, when he was committed 
to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary; two years 
later he served another three months for assault. Those were his only 
interludes behind bars, although he collected four more charges on his 
police record in 1921 and 1922, three for burglary and one for robbery. 
But by now O'Banion's political pull was beginning to be effective. 
On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was 
furnished by an alderman, and the charge was <nolle prossed>. On one 
of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant 
John J& Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour 
office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building; the jury wanted 
better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at a cost of $30,000 
in bribes, it was estimated. As promptly as Torrio, O'Banion jumped 
into bootlegging. He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous 
violence than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side 
portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money. Unlike the 
Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe-cracking 
expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution. He was also personally 
active in ward politics, and by 1924 O'Banion had acquired 
sufficient political might to be able to state: "I always deliver 
my borough as per requirements".   But whose requirements? 
Until 1924 O'Banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had 
kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic. There was a question-and-answer 
gag that went around at that time: Q& "Who'll 
carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards"? A& "O'Banion, 
in his pistol pocket". But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic 
hierarchy 
was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'Banion 
was being wooed by the opposition, and was meeting and conferring 
with important Republicans. To forestall any change of allegiance, 
the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'Banion, 
as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where 
his loyalties lay.   The reception was held in a private dining 
room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West. It was an interesting 
fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers, ward heelers, 
sold-out officials, and gunmen. The guest list is in itself a little 
parable of the state of American civic life at this time. It included 
the top O'Banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.

When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes 
for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department 
by consorting with these felons and fixers. Hughes said that he had 
understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'Connor, the 
proprieter of a Loop gambling house. "But when I arrived and recognised 
a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective 
bureau basement half a dozen times, I knew I had been framed, and 
withdrew almost at once".   In fact, O'Connor was honoured 
during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin. 
There was a brief interruption while one of O'Banion's men 
jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering 
him for a tip. Then O'Banion was presented with a platinum 
watch set with rubies and diamonds.   This dinner was the start 
of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians, 
which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, "had been maintained with 
more or less stealth", but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious 
gatherings, denounced by a clergyman as "Belshazzar feasts", 
at which "politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters, 
openly, in the big downtown hotels". Pasley continued: "They 
became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the 
moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments 
in 1928-29".   However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors 
no good whatever. O'Banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes 
to his loyalty, and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican 
deal. On Election Day- November 4- he energetically marshalled 
his force of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat 
votes. The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates.

This further demonstration of O'Banion's ballooning power 
did not please Torrio and Capone. In the past year there had been 
too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement 
for their liking. He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence 
that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards 
them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath 
their blandness. They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado- as, 
when his bodyguard, Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed 
by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of a Jewish 
gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation, who were Hirschey, 
a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'Banion, 
Frank, a policeman, and Max, the youngest. To settle this 
slight, O'Banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop, 
where, he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening of 
a musical comedy. At the end of the performance, Dave and Max came 
out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed 
first nighters. O'Banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely 
wounding him in the stomach. A second bullet ricocheted off Max's 
belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some distress. O'Banion 
tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre; he was neither 
prosecuted nor even arrested. That sort of braggadocio, for that sort 
of reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense. 
A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was 
when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street 
and demanded $300 to let it through. One of the beer-runners telephoned 
O'Banion- on a line tapped by the detective bureau- and 
reported the situation. O'Banion's reaction was: "Three hundred 
dollars! To them bums? Why, I can get them knocked off for 
half that much". Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle 
squads to prevent trouble if O'Banion should send his gunmen out 
to deal with the hijacking policemen. But in the meantime the beer-runner, 
unhappy with this solution, telephoned Torrio and returned to 
O'Banion with the message: "Say, Dionie, I just been talking 
to Johnny, and he said to let them cops have the three hundred. He 
says he don't want no trouble".   But Torrio and Capone had 
graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman. For three years, 
since the liquor territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic 
patience, and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent 
warfare and disaster to business, tolerated O'Banion's impudent 
double-crossing. They had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of 
his sharp practice in Cicero.   When, as a diplomatic gesture 
of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election, 
Torrio had given O'Banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from 
that district had been $20,000 a month. In six months O'Banion had 
boosted the profits to $100,000 a month- mainly by bringing pressure 
to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the 
suburb. These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies 
from the Sheldon, Saltis-McErlane, and Druggan-Lake gangs, 
and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-Capone saloons; 
once again O'Banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation 
of ill will. The revenue from O'Banion's Cicero territory 
went up still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-Capone 
takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and 
West Sides. But he still showed no intention of sharing with the 
syndicate. At last, even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still, 
and he tentatively suggested that O'Banion should take a percentage 
in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer 
concession. O'Banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.

Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'Banion 
gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car 
load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest 
coups of the Prohibition era- the Sibley warehouse robbery, 
which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation. Here was 
stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky. These 1750 cases were carted 
off in a one-night operation by the O'Banion men, who left in 
their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.

A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake 
or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous of all was launched by the 
explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific 
at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra 
with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away 
as San Francisco.   The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic 
inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale of 
the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth 
may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed, 
a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea 
in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists 
in the Biblical story of the Flood.   One of the most damaging 
tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 
1, 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away 
as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in the Atlantic 
Ocean; they are far more common in the Pacific. Japan has had 15 
destructive ones (eight of them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian 
Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.

In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled 
into the Inland Sea; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and 
boats in Osaka Bay. A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 
washed away an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn trees 
standing where the community had been. In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 
27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes.   The dimensions 
of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement. An ordinary 
sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to 
crest- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the 
Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes 
as much as 600 miles from crest to crest. While a wind wave never 
travels at more than 60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in 
the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour. The greater 
the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave; 
Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of 
the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity. In 
the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles 
per hour.   Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length 
that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable. Their amplitude 
sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest. Usually it 
is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build 
up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day in 1896 when the 
great waves approached Japan, fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells. 
Not until they sailed home at the end of the day, through a sea 
strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware of what 
had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water 
from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning 
thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.   The 
giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones. They 
usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into 
a ~V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.

Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell, 
not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers. 
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore 
as the first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and dry, and 
the beaches are covered with stranded fish. At Hilo large numbers 
of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach. 
Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for some 
minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore. After an earthquake 
in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified 
by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher 
ground. When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach, 
fearing that they might be buried under landslides. Just as they reached 
the shore, the first huge wave crashed upon them.   A tsunami 
is not a single wave but a series. The waves are separated by intervals 
of 15 minutes to an hour or more (because of their great length), 
and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great 
wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves may keep coming for many 
hours. Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the 
biggest.   Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was 
Francis P& Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
one of the world's foremost marine geologists. He was able to make 
a detailed inspection of the waves. Their onrush and retreat, he reported, 
was accompanied by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The 
third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some of the islands' 
beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the 
shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come. 
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest waves, 
55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.   Scientists and fishermen 
have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon. During 
a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night. The 
luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the 
stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism <Noctiluca miliaris> 
by the turbulence of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes 
observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have 
enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers 
of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance. The 
waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and 
battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth 
of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.

The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in 
Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised 
by Commander C& K& Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff. 
It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber 
which record the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water 
tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period of between 10 and 
40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding 
oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit. 
This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the 
station that a tsunami is in progress. Such equipment has been installed 
at Hilo, Midway, Attu and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm 
goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which 
is the center of the warning system.   This center also receives 
prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the 
Pacific which are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary 
determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide 
stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By means of charts showing 
wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is 
possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival 
at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific. 
The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger, 
and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps. All 
of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system, 
and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work 
smoothly.   Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami 
in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence. On November 4, 
1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula. 
At 17:07 that afternoon (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded 
by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately 
went into action. Within about an hour with the help of reports 
from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and California, the quake's 
epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees 
East longitude. While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came 
in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported it was covered 
with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian station made its calculations 
and notified the military services and the police that the first big 
wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.   It 
turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946. They hurled a 
cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone 
lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows. 
But not a single human life was lost, and property damage in the Hawaiian 
Islands did not exceed $800,000. There is little doubt that the 
warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.   But it is 
plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough. In the 
vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against 
building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they 
be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.

The key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the 
same. Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the 
sea to complex combinations in man. The land, too, is changing, and 
earthquakes are daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements 
in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes this is accompanied 
by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts 
cannot be seen, but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars 
of earlier breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are most 
numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated, 
but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth 
that has not had them.   The effects of earthquakes on civilization 
have been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role of 
an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously 
frightening, but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular 
disaster. Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.

We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know 
about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth 
which emerge with information about the materials through which they 
have traveled. These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface 
a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.

Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface, 
but they do not occur at greater depths. Two unsolved mysteries are 
based on these facts. (1) As far down as 400 miles below the surface 
the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to 
twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface 
rocks do. (2) If earthquakes do occur at such depths, why not deeper?

Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been 
applied in various fields. In the search for oil and gas, we make 
similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from 
them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation 
of these resources. We have also developed techniques for recognizing 
and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the 
ground which they generate.   The following discussion of this subject 
has been adapted from the book {Causes of Catastrophe} by 
L& Don Leet. 

#THE RESTLESS EARTH AND ITS INTERIOR#

<At twelve 
minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday>, April 18, 1906, 
San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake. A sharp tremor 
was followed by a jerky roll.

{IN} Ireland's County Limerick, near the River 
Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which 
means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the residents realize 
the influence their town has had on American military history, 
or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"! 
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was 
the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes, 
Sioux and Apaches, Mexican <banditos> under Pancho Villa, Japanese 
in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists 
in Korea. Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U& S& Cavalry 
Regiment, "The Fighting Seventh".   Today a battle 
cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, <esprit de corps> 
has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables. But don't 
tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a 
saloon on Saturday night.   Of all the thousands of men who have 
served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than 
Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C& Chandler. Wiry and burr-headed, 
with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler 
is the epitome of the old-time trooper. The truth is, however, that 
when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he 
had ever ridden 
was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded 
was a pencil.   Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical 
Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas 
City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make 
the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it. Though 
he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other 
desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces. The 
next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer 
of Troop ~H, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.

Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher 
spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a new ~CO brought in from 
the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper. Second, 
if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's 
on maneuvers. In combat, helping your ~CO make a fool of himself 
might mean getting yourself killed. But in maneuvers, with the top 
brass watching him all the time, it's easy.   Chandler understood 
this and expected the worst. But his first few days with Troop 
~H were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert 
Early. Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice. 
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident. He had 
enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately 
set about learning his new trade. There was no weapon Early could not 
take apart and reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and 
he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's 
correspondence courses. He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, 
history and literature as well.   But for all his erudite 
confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold. 
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved 
Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new ~CO know just how lucky 
he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United 
States Army. He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and 
the regiment. For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry 
under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the 
Battle of The Little Big Horn.   It didn't take Captain 
Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition 
on his shoulders as commander of Troop ~H. But what made the 
load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper 
was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop 
and the regiment.   Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison 
duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was the 
7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial 
Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler was not completely 
convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen". 
The final proof was a small incident.   It happened 
at the St& Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which 
had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains 
of an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler looked 
up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above 
the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen. The faces belonged 
to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And 
when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish 
songs the best.   Though there was an occasional good-natured 
chuckle about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago, 
singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really thought it was strange. 
For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni Martini, the bugler boy 
who carried Custer's last message, or Margarito Lopez, the one-man 
Army on Leyte, was a Garryowen, through and through. It was no 
coincidence 
that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders 
in the regiment.   And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen. 
He set out to keep Troop ~H the best troop in the best regiment. 
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook 
and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the 
troop. Even the mess sergeant, Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer 
from an airborne division, went out on the range.   The troop received 
a new leader, Lieutenant Robert M& Carroll, fresh out of 
~ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status. Carroll was sharp 
and military, but he was up against tough competition for that ~RA 
berth, and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set out to 
sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold 
a short time before.   When the Korean war began, on June 25, 
1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the 
Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead 
of Leyte during World War /2,, the 7th Cavalry was not in the 
best fighting condition. Its entire complement of non-commissioned 
officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit, 
and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World 
War /2,.   Just a month after the Korean War broke out, 
the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat. From 
then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting 
in Korea.   One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler 
called on that fabled <esprit de corps>. The regiment was dug in 
on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building 
up a concentration of crack troops on the other side. The troopers 
knew an attack was coming, but they didn't know when, and they 
didn't know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12, they 
were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against Troop ~H.

The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full 
force of 1000 men, armed with Russian machine guns, attacked the position 
held by Chandler's men. They came in waves. First came the 
cannon fodder, white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive 
human battering ram. They were followed by crack North Korean troops, 
who mounted one charge after another. They overran the 7th Cav's 
forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers, over 
piles of their own dead.   Another force flanked the company 
and took up a position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw 
that it was building up strength. He assembled a group of 25 men, composed 
of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply 
men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill. One of the more 
seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking 
for the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill 
to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.   Then 
Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one step, two, broke 
into a trot and then into a run. The first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"! 
burst from his throat. His followers shouted the old 
battle cry after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.

The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned 
down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire. Chandler, looking to 
right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure 
bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry 
as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued 
with the spirit of Garryowen. He had formed his own task force 
of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge. 
Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been 
pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again. But an enemy 
grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously. He 
went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face 
of 
the withering enemy fire.   Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, 
seeking a soft spot. They found it at the junction between Troops 
~H and ~G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin Goulding saw 
what was happening. He turned to his platoon. "Okay, men", he 
said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward, 
"Garryowen"! on his lips, his men following. But the bullets 
whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding 
fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that 
their lieutenant, 
the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead. 
Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming 
and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy like 
wild men.   That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant 
Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy 
soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements 
came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's 
platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled 
across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes were called in 
to kill them by the hundreds.   Though Bob Carroll seemed to have 
had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived. 
Today he is a major- in the Regular Army.   So filled 
was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was 
over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment. 
After years of digging, nights and weekends, he put together the 
big, profusely illustrated book, <Of Garryowen and Glory>, which 
is probably the most complete history of any military unit. ##

The 
battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle 
cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off. For nearly 
a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the 
regiment.   Take the case of Major Marcus A& Reno, who survived 
the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the enlisted 
men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried 
to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus 
Reno. Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But 
when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice 
made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield 
and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left 
to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him. 
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.   Although it was 
at 
the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been 
written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry 
first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by 
then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's 
first permanent commander and, like such generals as George 
S& Patton and Terry de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military 
prominence, 
Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.   During 
the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant record, was 
made 
brigadier general at the age of 23.   He finished the war as 
a major general, commanding a full division, and at 25 was the youngest 
major general in the history of the U& S& Army. 
I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in 
the sense that everyone agrees with them. If they were, Walter Lippmann 
would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock 
would have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however, that 
<I> take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying 
would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions. _ASSUMPTION 
1._ The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish 
a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom 
and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular- 
since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions 
be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak of "the largest 
possible measure" because any person who supposes that these 
conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons 
without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human 
beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around. _ASSUMPTION 
2._ These conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable 
in the qualified sense I have indicated- without the prior defeat 
of world Communism. This is true for two reasons: because Communism 
is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions; 
and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet 
power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization. Moreover, 
as Communist power increases, the enjoyment of these conditions 
throughout the world diminishes <pro rata> and the possibility of 
their restoration becomes increasingly remote. _ASSUMPTION 3._ It 
follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal 
of American policy. Proximate in the sense that there are more distant, 
more "positive" ends we seek, to which victory over Communism 
is but a means. But dominant in the sense that every other objective, 
no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it. Peace is a worthy 
objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the 
Communists out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the sense 
of self-determination, is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination 
to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into 
the Sino-Soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice 
is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails driving 
the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West, 
then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards 
yet a while longer. Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing 
higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient 
guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and 
denials will have to be made. It may be, of course, that such objectives 
can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism; 
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be 
resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant 
world- the absence of Soviet Communist power. 

#THE USES OF 
POWER#

This much having been said, the question remains whether we 
have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat Communism- 
and, if so, how those resources ought to be used. This brings us squarely 
to the problem of <power,> and the uses a nation makes of power. 
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that 
it always has been, that it always will be. And I suggest further 
that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of 
American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership 
in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously. 
In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting 
the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them 
into proper focus. One was demonstrably false; the other, for the 
most part, true.   The first was that America had become- or 
was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I know I 
do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention. You 
may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment- 
I certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all American 
strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States 
not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the 
development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent 
feature of U&S&-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future.

I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority 
on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr& Jameson 
Campaigne has done it well in his new book <American Might and Soviet 
Myth>. Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we 
were in the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000 
modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases 
in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming Russian naval power would 
always be within a few hundred miles of our coast. Half of the population 
of the U&S& would be needed to work on arms just to feed 
the people". Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where 
oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity. 
Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would 
severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the 
missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.   If 
we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's 
nightmarish worries- or, at least, of the worries he might have if 
his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage. 

#U&S& "PRESTIGE"# 

The other charge was that America's political position 
in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years. The 
contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it 
ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to 
see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.

The argument was typically advanced in terms of U&S& "prestige". 
Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem; and 
even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading. Prestige 
is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill. But contrary 
to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important 
for its own sake. Only the vain and incurably sentimental among 
us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed 
by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose sleep over 
is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are 
likely to do about it.   The evidence suggests that foreign peoples 
believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and 
is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead. This ignorant 
estimate, I repeat, is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes 
very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically 
do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be 
the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining U&S& prestige 
means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on 
an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet 
intimidation, there is reason for concern.   Still, these guesses 
about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the 
actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here 
I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and 
overwhelming but of political power- of influence, if you will- 
about which the relevant questions are: Is Soviet influence throughout 
the world greater or less than it was ten years ago? And is Western 
influence greater or less than it used to be? 

#COMMUNIST GAINS# 

In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether 
Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy 
before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform 
are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded: 
the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend 
on such spectacular and definitive conquests. Success may mean merely 
the displacement of Western influence.   Communist political 
warfare, we must remember, is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages. 
Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they 
could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where 
the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla 
skirmishes, 
in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine 
meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, 
on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences- preferably at 
the highest level.   The Soviets understand, moreover, that the 
first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against 
the West. Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover 
is to "neutralize" a country. The second stage is to retain the 
nominal classification of "neutralist", while in fact turning the 
country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy. And 
this may be as far as the process will go. The Kremlin's goal is 
the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States- 
and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade 
under a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries 
of the Soviet Foreign Office.   To recite the particulars of 
recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring.   Six years ago 
French Indochina, though in troubie, was in the Western camp. Today 
Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between 
Communism and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all 
practical purposes, neutralist.   Indonesia, in the early days of 
the Republic, leaned toward the West. Today Sukarno's government 
is heavily besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist" 
pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.   Ceylon 
has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly 
hostile to the West.   In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and 
Egypt were, a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser 
and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent 
for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel; 
in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.

A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve. Never 
mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination: 
the point is that in the struggle for the world that 
vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West. Today, 
Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging, 
it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.   Latin America was once 
an area as "safe" for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today 
it is up for grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become 
a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In some countries 
the trend has gone further than others: Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela 
are displaying open sympathy for Castroism, and there is no country- 
save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently 
arranged- where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent 
the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause.

Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the 
surface. The strains of neutralism are running strong, notably in 
England, and even in Germany. 

#OPPORTUNITIES MISSED#

What have 
we to show by way of counter-successes? We have had opportunities- 
clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron 
Curtain. There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised 
and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish Revolution 
which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable 
to Soviet interests. There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended 
did not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively 
and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power: in Guatemala. 
And contrary to what has been said recently, we did not wait for "outside 
pressures" and "world opinion" to bring down that Communist 
government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist 
<coup 
d'etat>. We served our national interests, and by so doing we 
saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.

THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening, 
roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.   "Sounds 
exactly like last time". The young man spoke steadily enough, 
but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven. The middle-aged man 
said over and over, "Why did I come here, why did I come 
here". 
Then he was sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons, 
I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the lights went out.

This was my 
second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of 
Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave. Where was my flashlight? 
Where should I go? To my room? Better stay in the hotel lobby, 
where the walls looked good and thick.   Chinese and Indian 
merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters. Hotel 
attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small 
boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please". 
She held out her hand to show that she had money.   The American 
newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office. But what 
was the story? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this 
far? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane?   "Let's 
play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof and see". 

#GUNFIRE 
SAVES THE MOON#

By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had 
been an eclipse of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that 
the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all 
possible noise, ideally with firearms.   The din was successful, 
too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had 
begun 
to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.   How 
quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant posted a reminder to 
patrons "who became excited and left without paying their checks". 
But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later. 
And no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood, had 
become the City of Bullet Holes.   I saw holes in planes at the 
airport and in cars in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly 
a house had not been peppered. In place of the police headquarters 
was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars had demolished the 
defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door. What 
had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened 
brick.   This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane, 
fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments 
had ruled here in three days (December 9-11, 1960). And now, in March, 
all Laos suffered a state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held 
two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more. 
Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush 
and death.   "And it's all the more tragic because it's 
so little deserved", said Mr& J& J& A& Frans, a Belgian 
official of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural 
Organization. We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with 
the U& N& flag.   Practically all the people of Laos, he 
explained- about two million of them- are rice farmers, and the means 
and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel 
plows. They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes 
in ten or eleven thousand villages, with an average of 200 souls. 
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are. They spread 
over an area no larger than Oregon; yet they include peoples as different 
from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians. 

#LIFE 
MUST BE KEPT IN HARMONY#

"What matters here is family loyalty; 
faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the <phis>, the spirits; 
and to live in harmony with nature".   Harmony in Laos? 
"Precisely", said Mr& Frans. He spoke of the season of 
dryness and dust, brought by the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony 
with the season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from the southwest. 
The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering 
Mekong River. Shy, slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with 
the frangipani by the wayside. Even life in harmony with death. For 
so long as death was not violent, it was natural and to be welcomed, 
making a funeral a feast.   To many a Frenchman- they came 
95 years ago, colonized, and stayed until Laos became independent in 
1953- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti. 
Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen 
around the globe. The Pathet Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans 
from neighboring North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft. 
The Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped with 
American funds. In six years, U& S& aid had amounted to more 
than $1.60 for each American- a total of three hundred million dollars.

We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened 
to ignite another war among the world's giants. Even if it 
did not, how would this little world of gentle people cope with its 
new reality of grenades and submachine guns?   To find out, we 
traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled, in 
the daytime at least, by the Royal Lao Army: from Attopeu, the 
City 
of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the City of 
Lions in the northwest, close to Communist China (map, page 250). 
We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil 
between ruts, all four wheels spinning uselessly. We flew in rickety 
planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash. In the 
end we ran into Communist artillery fire.   "We" were Bill 
Garrett of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Illustrations Staff, whose 
three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any 
fighting man we met; Boun My, our interpreter; and myself.

Boun My- the name means one who has a <boun>, a celebration, and 
is therefore lucky- was born in Savannakhet, the Border of Paradise. 
He had attended three universities in the United States. But 
he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane, 
including the royal capital, Luang Prabang. Before the airplanes 
came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible. 

#PRIME 
MINISTER MOVES FAST#

Alas, so it almost proved for us, too. To 
go outside the few cities required permits. and getting them seemed 
a life's work. Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured, and 
few soldiers could be spared as escorts.   We were told that to 
the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped American was worth at least $750, a fortune 
in Laos. Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had 
spurned an escort. Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching 
him barefoot from village to village, as evidence of evil American 
intervention.   Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government 
offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation 
in French, we were getting nowhere. We had nearly decided 
that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true, when we were invited 
to take a trip with the Prime Minister. Could we be ready in 15 
minutes? His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of 
town, and he was eager to be off. 

#PRINCE WEARS TEN-GALLON HAT#

And 
so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing 
along in a Jeep right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun 
Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket 
and a ten-gallon hat from Texas. From his shoulder bag peeked the 
seven-inch barrel of a Luger.   The temperature rose to 105`. 
With our company of soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.

In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister 
bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks for me. 
Then we drove on, until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice 
fields, bouncing across their squat earth walls.   It was a 
spleen-crushing day. An hour of bouncing, a brief stop in a village to 
inspect a new school or dispensary. More bouncing, another stop, a 
new house for teachers, a new well. Then off again, rushing to keep up. 
We were miserable.   But our two Jeep mates- Keo Viphakone 
from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania- 
were beaming under their coatings of dust. Together they had probably 
done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century- 
constructively. Mr& Keo, once a diplomat in Paris and Washington, 
was Commissioner of Rural Affairs. John, an engineer and anthropologist 
with a doctorate from the London School of Economics, 
headed the rural development division of ~USOM, the United States 
Operations Mission administering U&S& aid.   "What 
you see are self-help projects", John said. "We ask the people 
what they want, and they supply the labor. We send shovels, cement, 
nails, 
and corrugated iron for roofs. That way they have an infirmary 
for $400. We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up to a lot more 
than just roads and wells and schools. Ask Mr& Keo". 
Mr& 
Keo agreed. "Our people have been used to accepting things as 
they found them", he said. "Where there was no road, they lived 
without one. Now they learn that men can change their surroundings, 
through their traditional village elders, without violence. That's 
a big step toward a modern state. You might say we are in the nation-building 
business".   In the villages people lined up to give 
us flowers. Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine. The Prime Minister 
paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode rapidly among the 
houses, joked with the local soldiery, and made a speech. The soldiers 
are fighting and the Americans are helping, he said, but in the 
fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.

Then we were off again. We did it for three days.   But 
our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery. Crossing the 4,000-foot 
width of the Mekong at Champassak, on a raft with an outboard 
motor, we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean 
breeze. Then we hung overboard in the water.   Briefly we rolled 
over a paved road up to Pak Song, on the cool Bolovens Plateau. 
The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported 
by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and fed rice 
to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song. 

#STRINGS 
KEEP SOULS IN PLACE#

In the village of Soukhouma, which means 
"Peaceful", we had a <baci>. This is the most endearing of Lao 
ceremonies. It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing 
for myriad occasions- for the traveler, a wedding, a newborn child, 
the sick, the New Year, for any good purpose.   The preparations 
were elaborate: flowers, candles, incense sticks, rice wine, dozens 
of delicacies, and pieces of white cotton string. The strings were 
draped around flowers in tall silver bowls (page 261).   The 
candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village 
notables. I was careful to keep my feet, the seat of the least worthy 
spirits, from pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits 
reside. Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to 
come and join us.   Next he addressed himself to our souls. A 
man has 32 souls, one for each part of the body. Those souls like to 
wander off, and must be called back.   With the divinities present 
and our souls in place, we were wished health, happiness, and power. 
Then, one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings 
around our wrists. These were to be kept on, to hold in the 32 souls.

As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came up to John 
Cool and silently showed him his hand. It had a festering hole as 
big as a silver dollar. We could see maggots moving.   John said: 
"I have some antiseptic salve with me, but it's too late for 
that".

My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening 
of religious and ethnic bonds. Jewish identity was often confused 
with social and economic strivings. "Being Jewish gives you tremendous 
drive", a boy remarked. "It means that you have to get 
ahead". When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I encountered 
the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith good will, and 
a small residue of ethnic loyalty.   "I like the tradition", 
a girl said. "I like to follow the holidays when they come along. 
But you don't have to worship in the traditional way. You can communicate 
in your own way. As I see it, there's no real difference between 
being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant".   Another teen-ager 
remarked: "Most Jews don't believe in God, but they believe 
in people- in helping people". Still another boy asserted: 
"To be a good Jew is to do no wrong; it's to be a good person". 
When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant, 
the boy answered, "It's the same thing".   This accords 
with the study by Maier and Spinrad. They discovered that, although 
42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the 
Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings 
of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this 
conviction. The most important aims of the Jewish students were as 
follows: to make the world a better place to live in- 30 per cent; 
to get happiness for yourself- 28 per cent; and financial independence- 
21 per cent.   Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers 
I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even 
envisioned joining a synagogue or temple. However, they were hostile 
to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to believe in Judaism "but in a 
moderate way". One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews: "It's 
the twentieth century, and they don't have to wear beards".

The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked 
force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds. "We were brought 
up that way" was one statement which won general assent. "I 
want to show respect for my parents' religion" was the way in which 
a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism. Still 
another suggested that he would join a temple "for social reasons, 
since I'll be living in a suburb".   Intermarriage, which 
is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not 
with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval. 
Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic 
grounds. "When you marry, you want to have things in common", a 
girl said, "and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your 
own background".   A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle 
West observed wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently interfered 
with religious activities- at least with the peripheral activities 
that many middle class Jews now regard as religious. It appears 
that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing 
sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would 
not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food. Another 
girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as "the 
only Orthodox girl in town". This is, no doubt, inaccurate, 
but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the 
nonobservant. 

#THE OLDER TEENS#

One of the significant things about 
Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented. 
Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college 
age attend institutions of higher learning. This is substantially higher 
than the figures for the American population at large- 45.6 per 
cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females. This may help explain 
a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy. In their first two 
years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions 
to win positions on the school teams. However, in their junior and 
senior years, they generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably 
in the interest of better academic achievement. It is significant, 
too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed, unlike the 
younger ones, that Jewish students tend to do better academically than 
their gentile counterparts.   The percentage of Jewish girls 
who attend college is almost as high as that of boys. The motivations 
for both sexes, to be sure, are different. The vocational motive is 
the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls attend college for social 
reasons and to become culturally developed. One of the significant 
developments in American-Jewish life is that the cultural consumers 
are largely the women. It is they who read- and make- Jewish 
best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.   In 
upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group tends to have a sense 
of marginality. "People automatically assume that I'm in college", 
a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably. However, among 
the girls, there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going 
to college. The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an 
office- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers- and, buttressed 
by a respectable income, she is likely to dress better and live 
more expansively than the college student. She is even prone to regard 
the college girl as immature. 

#THE LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS COLLEGE STUDENT# 

One of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers 
in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend 
local colleges at modest cost. This is particularly true in large centers 
of Jewish population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is 
that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their 
gentile counterparts, 
they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed 
Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-Jewish 
world.   Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College- 
constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session- can 
serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle class Jewish student.

There is, to begin, an important sex difference. Typically, in 
a lower-middle class Jewish family, a son will be sent to an out-of-town 
school, if financial resources warrant it, while the daughter will 
attend the local college. There are two reasons for this. First, 
the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's. Second, 
the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter 
than toward the son. Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise 
vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by 
keeping them home. The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn 
College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically. 
One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.

Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their 
school. On the one hand, there is a sense of not having moved beyond 
the ambiance of their high school. This is particularly acute for 
those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street 
from Brooklyn College. They have a sense of marginality at being denied 
that special badge of status, the out-of-town school. At the same 
time, there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good 
college- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable 
virtues- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling 
that the college generates. "It's people of your own kind", a girl 
remarked. "You don't have to watch what you say. Of course, 
I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds 
of people, but I would want lots of Jewish kids there".   For 
most Brooklyn College students, college is at once a perpetuation 
of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood 
and family. @rooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in 
tone, and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably 
midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing. However, a 
growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by 
courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly 
critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents. And 
the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional 
conflict of culture but, rather, a protest against a culture that they 
view as softly and insidiously enveloping. "As long as I'm home, 
I'll never grow up", a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly. 
"They don't like it if I do anything away from home. It's so 
much trouble, I don't usually bother".   For girls, the overprotection 
is far more pervasive. Parents will drive on Friday night 
to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting. 
A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn 
College and demanded the "low-down" on a boy who was going out 
with his daughter. The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice 
of a major field. Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn 
College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with 
marriage plans- limited graduate study requirement and convenient 
working hours. This means that a great many academically talented girls 
are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature. 
A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls 
as it does in the realm of sex.   The breaking away from the prison 
house of Brooklyn is gradual. First, the student trains on his 
hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological 
and sociological insights. Then, with the new affluence, there is 
actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide world beyond the precincts 
of New York. It is significant that the Catskills, which used to 
be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb 
of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers- except for 
those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day 
camps. The great world beyond beckons. But it should be pointed out 
that some of the new watering places- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton, 
Long Island, for example- tend to be homogeneously Jewish. 
Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad 
program, a good number of students spend summers in Europe. In 
general, however, the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that 
of the student at Harvard or Smith. And acculturation into the world 
at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after 
college rather than during the four school years.   Brooklyn 
College is Marjorie Morningstar territory, as much as the Bronx or 
Central Park West. There are hordes of nubile young women there 
who, prodded by their impatient mothers, are determined to marry. 
It is interesting that, although the percentage of married students 
is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere- about 30 per 
cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class- 
the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate. "Almost 
everybody in the senior class is married", students say dogmatically. 
And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities, 
and houses (in the House Plan Association) that have good 
news to impart. These announcements are, in effect, advertisements 
for themselves as thriving marriage marts. There are boxed proclamations 
in the newspaper of watchings, pinnings, ringings, engagements, and 
marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity. "Witt House 
happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz 
of Fife House".   The Brooklyn College student shows 
some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models. The Ivy 
League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are as likely to 
dress in rather foppish Continental fashion, or even in nondescript 
working class manner, as they are in the restrained, button-down Ivy 
way. The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts 
out of town, and eye shadow, mascara, and elaborate <bouffant> 
hairdos- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel- 
are not unknown even in early morning classes.   Among the 
boys, there is very little bravado about drinking. Brooklyn College 
is distinctive for not having an official drinking place. The Fort Lauderdale 
encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College 
boys. 
This should be used frequently (but shaken before using). For galled 
breasts, the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard 
enough white chalk to make a paste. This could also be used for any 
other skin irritation. Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for 
a short time and then apply this under her breasts.   "Female 
troubles" of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the 
frontier; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind 
in my collection, one for hastening delayed menstruation. The sufferer 
drinks tansy tea.   Bruises, burns, cuts, etc&, occurred frequently 
on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers to these 
problems too. Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of 
raw beefsteak. (Doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness 
of the applications which relieved the pain.) Salted butter was 
another 
cure for bruises. Many people agreed that burns should be treated 
with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard, but one informant 
told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water; the burn oozed 
watery fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed by 
bathing it with epsom salts. Another swore by vinegar baths for burns, 
and still another recommended salted butter. "Butter salve" or 
"butter ointment" was used for burns, and for bruises as well. This 
was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil; 
when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and bottled. Cow's 
milk was another cure for burns, and burns covered with gum arabic or 
plain mucilage healed quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and 
eyes by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not find a doctor 
at the time. A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings, 
which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat". 
Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results 
were good, but which treatment helped is still not known.   To 
stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds. One old-timer 
said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut, even when on a knuckle, if it 
was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent 
infection. My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy 
for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury 
and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth, over which she poured 
turpentine. He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically 
amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar 
showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw" of tobacco put 
on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing. Or a thin slice 
of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing. One 
old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a 
fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his 
head. His brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached 
the boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the scalp back 
in place, and covered the raw edges with the slices. Then he put a rag 
around the dressing to keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further 
care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no 
scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding, 
and rue was an antiseptic. Until quite recently, "sterile" maggots 
could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface, 
leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.   Tetanus 
could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound. One family 
bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips, or, if these were not 
handy, plain lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the 
wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were cured or prevented 
by "madstones" which the pioneer wore or carried. In 1872 there were 
known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the 
family for 200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds, 
then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.   While nowadays 
we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at 
the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had 
little 
variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused it, a cold pack 
was usually first aid. This might be applied to the top of the nose 
or the back of the neck, pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the 
nostril (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could be 
stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and 
tying in it a knot for each year of his life. Or the victim could chew 
hard on a piece of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in 
his ears.   Old sores could be healed by the constant application 
of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood blisters could 
be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with 
any hard nonpoisonous substance. Felons were cured by taking common 
salt and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing it with equal 
parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on 
a cloth and wrapped around the affected part. As the cloth dried, more 
of the mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the felon was 
supposed to be "killed".   Insect bites were cured in many 
ways. Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; "get a bite, 
spit on it" was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow 
clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings; 
not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular. Chiggers were a 
common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so 
small as to be scarcely visible to the eye, they buried themselves in 
the victim's flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief 
and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased by applying liquid 
bluing. For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half 
a glass of soda was made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by 
scraping an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to bathe the 
painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well 
as soap. Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve 
wasp or bee stings.   Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days; 
to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore. Bed 
slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were placed in cups 
of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate, 
applied with a feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding 
pioneer homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice in their 
hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment, but it did the 
job.   To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should 
be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be removed from the 
eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye. As the seed swelled its glutinous 
covering protected the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder 
and the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove small 
objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle 
would then move toward the nose, where it could be wiped out with 
a wisp of cotton.   Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug, 
used in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and 
one 
ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth. Itching 
skin, considered "just nerves", was eased by treating with 
whiskey and salt. Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider 
in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To cure fungus growths 
on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of 
sassafras bark in a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning 
and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same 
solution. Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and 
had defied other remedies. Frostbite was treated by putting the feet 
and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one hears that 
heat and hot water are used instead. Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus, 
used as well for chilblains. Chilblains were also treated with 
tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.   Boils have always been 
a source of much trouble. A German informant gave me a sure cure 
made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice 
was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped in water 
until it formed a sticky, gummy solution. This was also used for sores. 
Another frequent pioneer difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy 
shoes and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me she has 
used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they 
remove the pain or "fire". Another common cure was to soak the 
feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of 
equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight. 
This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed 
the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.

There were many cures for warts. One young girl told me how her 
mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in 
vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several 
times. Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a 
bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the 
house for seven days. Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's 
sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on 
wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear 
after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did 
just that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy. 
Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie 
it on the wart, and wear it for a week. A simpler method was to tie 
a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way. I 
know this worked. One person recommended to me washing the wart with 
sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato 
three times daily. Another common method was to cut an onion in two and 
place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened 
together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave. As the 
onion decayed, so did the wart.   Sore muscles were relieved by 
an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's 
ubiquitous herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water 
in which two cups of salt had been dissolved. Leg cramps, one person 
tells me, were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the 
body on the heel and pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I 
can testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy 
before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in the back of the leg and in 
the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope 
about the patient's waist.   For sprains and swellings, one 
pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added 
to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.

EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable 
plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock 
the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper 
or <negociant> who in turn supplies him. In instances where 
both of these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation is ideal. 
It may, on occasion, be anything but that. However, by cultivating 
a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain 
whether he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he may 
have been told by salesmen and promoters) and, better yet, whether he 
has a taste for wine. Again, by spreading one's purchases over several 
wine dealers, one becomes familiar with the names and specialties 
of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This is important because, 
despite all the efforts of the French government, an appreciable 
segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a 
misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many 
too many <negociants> who would rather turn a <sou> than amass a 
creditable reputation overseas.   A good <negociant> or shipper 
will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from 
the best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also be the 
one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards 
generally in his own district. These are the wines the French themselves 
use for everyday drinking, for even in France virtually no one 
drinks the <Grands Crus> on a meal-to-meal basis. The <Grands 
Crus> are expensive, and even doting palates tire of them. And certainly, 
in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine 
drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready 
for the <Grands Crus> as a steady diet without frequent recourse 
to <crus> of less renown. There is nothing <infra dig> about a 
good blend from a good shipper. Some of them are very delicious indeed, 
and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately, along with 
others not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable wine dealer 
and constant experimentation- "steering ever from the known to 
the unknown"- are the requisites.   Wine waiters are something 
else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great 
deal, their importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate 
on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and 
some other Latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty 
of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof 
on the customer himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!) 
is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly, if everyone 
in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them, the 
supply would dry up in no time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating, 
argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible 
attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine waiter is, 
paradoxically, the guardian (and not the purveyor) of his cellar against 
the Visigoths. Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible 
supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped 
with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine 
waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence. The one way to 
get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking 
to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter 
is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending 
money. Only then, perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.

Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest 
for several weeks before it is served. This is especially true of 
red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well 
worth the effort. It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter 
of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal. Wine stored 
for a long time should be on its side; otherwise, the cork dries 
and air enters to spoil it. When stacking wine on its side in a bin, 
care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next 
to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling 
around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard 
or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture. 
Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again with ill effects. 
The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine (provided the eye 
has not already spotted it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after 
pulling it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right; 
if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.   Seasonal 
rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely. 
The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five 
degrees, with an allowable range of five degrees above or below 
this, provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged vibration 
is also undesirable; consequently, one's wine closet or cellar 
should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces. If 
one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have 
one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time. 
Light, especially daylight, is always bad for wine.   All in 
all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations 
thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go 
to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without 
further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious 
cork. No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure 
they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning 
is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree 
of purism! But the fact remains that in most restaurants, including 
some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle 
is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered, 
and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place 
while the chef is preparing the meal. A white wine, already at cool 
cellar temperature, may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and 
water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the former is far 
preferable) in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter 
climate, there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow. Though 
by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought 
from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so 
before serving time. It may be a bit cold when poured; but again, 
as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should 
be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is never filled more 
than half full. In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly- 
and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste 
and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or the course), in 
the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting 
stages. The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming 
a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an 
open fire. This invariably effaces any wine's character, and drives 
its fragrance underground.   It should not be forgotten that 
wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly 
in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams, 
Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively. Very old red wines 
often require several hours of aeration, and any red wine, brought from 
the cellar within half an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed 
some air. But white wines never! White wines should be opened 
when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their 
sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse 
or a Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted 
method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white 
wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving 
a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive. 
The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death 
when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air. To quote 
Professor Saintsbury: "The last glass of claret or Burgundy 
is as good as the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem 
or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This does not 
mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there 
is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or 
the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good. If 
this must be done, they should always be corked and kept in a cool place; 
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably 
shorter than those of milk.   A few red wines, notably those 
of the Beaujolais, are better consumed at cellar temperature. By 
tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature- 
if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin 
and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well. Thus, 
red wine must, if possible, never be disturbed or shaken; very old 
red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which 
have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself. 
A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may 
do as much harm as a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually 
and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.   Many 
people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully 
from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without 
disturbing the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and 
insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand 
on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom, 
after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position 
on its side in the cradle.   In France, when one wishes to entertain 
at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the 
restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice 
of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them. The wine 
waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened 
at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on 
end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines, 
be decanted. Decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be- 
practically speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process 
of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead of several 
or more times at the table: hence, a minimum of the undesirable mixture 
of wine and dregs.   Though there are many exceptions, which 
we have noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best consumed 
between two and six years old, and red wines, nowadays, between three 
and ten. Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep 
longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite 
number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into their own until 
they are ten or fifteen years of age, or even more. If a red Bordeaux 
of a good name and year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting, 
leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais, on 
the other hand, <should> be drunk while very young; and Alsatians 
<may> be. 
Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest assured that 
your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter 
and Spirit strictly complied with **h and most particularly in regard 
to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane 
views".   Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation. 
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's 
overseer. An excellent crop was expected that year. 
William, 
who lived in neighboring St& Mary's parish, had taken charge and 
decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated 
for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this plan, citing the 
depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions 
at the plantation. If sold then, the land and improvements might 
bring only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference with 
Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning of Gorham's 
intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother. 
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs, 
he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless 
Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation, 
and Louisiana law required their removal from the state. Gorham 
refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how 
much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the 
North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was 
not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes 
who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid 
his annoyance, although both he and William were furious with their 
Yankee brother. William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen 
that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would 
sue "amicably" to protect his interests.   Palfrey was 
determined 
that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers 
during the transition period before emancipation. If William wished 
to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes 
undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there as are ever 
paid the labor of persons of their sex + age. A disposition to exert 
themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them 
**h to come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our plantation 
+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement". When he heard 
of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could 
be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was willing 
to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block 
his ultimate aim. William was adamant on one point: under no circumstances 
would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his 
and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom. Knowing 
the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the 
number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them 
to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific 
instructions, he agreed to William's condition.   In March 
there was a division of the slaves, and Giffen carried out his instructions 
as nearly as possible. Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded 
in getting a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered 
that your views would be best carried out", he explained, 
"by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend 
the philantrophy of Emancipation. I have also taken the old servants 
of your father as a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages 
of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to 
an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the 
wickedness of slavery, they were put aside after he received an inventory 
of the slave property he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human 
worth in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity, was all 
he needed. Each human being, known only by a given name, had a cash value. 
Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150; 
Rose, a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential, was worth $400. 
In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey 
was giving up close to $7,000.   Palfrey's brothers each received 
lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed 
that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus twenty "black 
souls" were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land 
of free men. Giffen extracted one concession from William: the house 
servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.

Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans for freeing 
his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he could get the necessary approval, 
fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special 
permission. According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty 
years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned the state legislature 
to waive the requirement. Otherwise, freedom would mean removal 
from the state in which "as the place of their past residence from 
birth, or for many years, it would **h be materially for their advantage 
to be at liberty to remain". On March 11 the Louisiana legislature 
voted unanimously to table the petition. News of the legislative 
veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William 
became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt 
in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of 
the New Orleans <Courier,> shouting that the emancipation scheme 
had become a public affair, and that it would reach the "Ears of the 
People on the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".

His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had 
imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves, and to keep 
the family from falling apart over the issue. When Giffen decided 
to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily 
assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers 
would never have any cause to complain of him.   in view of these 
difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana. Giffen had already 
urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters. 
His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him 
to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April. Palfrey 
told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New 
Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence 
that he might be allowed to see his family again.   During his journey 
Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists. In both cases he 
desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived 
in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed him 
enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from the Legislature 
of Louisiana, and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood 
of man". Mrs& Child, who had once apologized for sending 
editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one 
of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before, 
but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana. She agreed to 
take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send 
them north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey consulted 
with Cassius M& Clay on the same subject, but with no apparent 
result.   Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety, 
Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial. Instead 
of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature of his mission, 
he received many calling cards and invitations from "gentlemen of mark, 
on whom I had no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations 
than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of 
the "marked attention and civility" with which the New Orleans 
gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him. The memory of this southern 
hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years 
and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic 
account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas, 
"many of whom were coarse + passionate people, much excited by what 
they heard of my plans". He proceeded with his task bravely- in 
his memoirs, at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should 
have time to boil too high".   Palfrey had already made up his 
mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely 
whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by remaining behind 
condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage. He had a 
short private talk with each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey 
soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others. All the 
slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure 
until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in "their 
own little produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain 
as wage laborers for his account. William's threat that under 
no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious" slaves to mix with 
his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation 
as before. Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to 
have made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience".

From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest 
in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time for their departure 
approached, his solicitousness increased. Should any slave change 
his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage 
at once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally 
established, 
Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters 
in New Orleans and aboard ship. Giffen assured him that the captain 
and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration. 
Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage 
to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation was sold in January, 
1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people 
two months' wages. Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation 
for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined to 
enter into any philanthropic arrangement.   On March 21, 1845 the 
bark <Bashaw> weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee 
Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former 
chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled 
regret and jubilation.   Not all of Palfrey's slaves were 
aboard the <Bashaw>. Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult 
to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants. Two of 
these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen filed a petition for 
permission to emancipate four slaves (all more than fifty years old) 
with the St& Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection, 
which he attributed to a "general Excitement against Abolition 
and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right individuals on the 
jury, and got the permission without further delay.   When the 
Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were, of course, no longer 
slaves. Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of 
the constitution of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and 
equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's 
Chapel to formalize the emancipation. An eyewitness recalled 
how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed 
in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed 
while they listened to the few words that declared them free.

Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction, 
he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes 
as servants. Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in 
the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts. 
Mrs& Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children 
with a Quaker 
family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York. 
This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was 
in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.

But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a 
group more varied in background and interest. Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean, has headed 
the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for 
international cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office 
was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first 
Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs. 
("In the late forties and fifties", Coombs has declared in defining 
his role, "two strong new arms were added to reinforce United 
States foreign policy **h economic assistance and military assistance. 
As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity **h to build 
a third strong arm, aimed at the development of people, at the fuller 
realization of their creative human potential, and at better understanding 
among them".)   Many of the new appointees are art collectors. 
Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital 
with a collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin, 
Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and 
Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps, R& Sargent Shriver, 
Jr&, a Kennedy brother-in-law, collects heavily among the moderns, 
including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury 
Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet, <Femmes dans un jardin>.

Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President 
of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation different from 
that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson, 
who had been head of General Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at 
times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara 
is the scholar-businessman. An inveterate reader of books, he chose 
while working in Detroit to live in the University community of 
Ann Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller of 
Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former Rhodes Scholar, Charles 
Hitch, who is author of a study on <The Economics of Defense 
in the Nuclear Age>.   One of the President's special assistants, 
the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry 
L& Stimson of the latter's classic memoir, <On Active Service>. 
Another, Arthur M& Schlesinger, Jr&, has won a Pulitzer 
Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter. The 
Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy as a pianist. 
("It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who **h neither 
know nor understand music", he declared not long ago in proposing 
that White House prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs& Arthur 
Goldberg, wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally 
and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District 
of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a new frontier", she claims. 
"In fact, the search is almost more important than the find".) 
Mrs& Henry Labouisse, wife of the new director of the foreign 
aid program, is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.   The list 
goes on. At last count, sixteen former Rhodes Scholars (see box on 
page 13) had been appointed to the Administration, second in number 
only to its Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice Department's 
Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has won a Pulitzer 
Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster General J& Edward 
Day, who must deal with matters of postal censorship, is himself 
author of a novel, <Bartholf Street,> albeit one he was obliged to 
publish 
at his own expense.   Two men show promise of playing prominent 
roles:   William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has 
been a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in Washington 
about the same time during the early postwar years: Kennedy as the 
young Congressman from Massachusetts; Walton, after a wartime stint 
with <Time-Life>, to become bureau chief for the <New Republic>. 
Both lived in Georgetown, were unattached, and shared an active 
social life. Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become 
one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters, vows that he 
and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days. Nonetheless, they 
found common interests. During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked 
Walton, an utter novice in organization politics, to assist him. 
Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the 
hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted 
to be liaison officer to critically important New York City.

Walton, who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's 
paratroopers during the invasion of France, combines the soul 
of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials 
when, after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House 
with Mrs& Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased the 
joint to see what was there". But his credentials are impeccable. 
Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise 
on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the 
renovation of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will continue 
to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter, strictly ex 
officio, for culture.   A more official representative is the Secretary 
of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon 
first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken man with a lust 
for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight. 
But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians, he displays 
a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments. 
His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals 
such as C& P& Snow, Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.

Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great 
deal more than dams and wildlife preserves. After promoting Frost's 
appearance at the Inauguration, he persuaded the poet to return 
several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet 
members, members of Congress, and other Washington notables gathered 
in the State Department auditorium. The event was so successful 
that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar 
ones from time to time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment 
of the Administration.   His Ideas in this respect, however, 
sometimes arouse critical response. One tempest was stirred up last 
March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue 
of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum, 
would be sent "on indefinite loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's 
birthplace. Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors 
promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his 
own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech he had made two 
years earlier as a Congressman, decrying the more than two hundred 
statues, monuments, and memorials which "dot the Washington landscape 
**h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching 
new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall had proposed 
that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.

He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the 
case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce 
that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no 
desire to "hustle" it out of Washington. The last Congress adopted 
seven bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko, 
the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced. Active 
warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first 
Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac, and T& 
R&'s own living children, who wish to preserve the island as 
a wildlife sanctuary. The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin 
D& Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved with 
his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its critics, "Instant 
Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's headaches, since as supervisor 
of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility 
for building it.   "Washington", President Kennedy 
has been heard to remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency 
and northern charm". There have been indications that he hopes 
to redress that situation, commencing with the White House. One of 
Mrs& Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state 
of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national 
shrine. Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture 
assembled by President Thomas Jefferson, the White House has collected 
a hodgepodge of period pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.

Mrs& Kennedy shows a determination to change all this. 
Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk, hewed from 
the timbers of the British ship H&M&S& <Resolute> and 
presented to 
President Hayes by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President 
in his oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the 
<Gazette des Beaux-Arts,> she found a description of a handsome gilt 
pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe. She traced 
it to a storage room. With its coating of gold radiator paint removed- 
a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its 
rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White 
House.   But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century 
furniture (which Mrs& Kennedy feels is the proper period 
for 
the White House) must be pursued in places other than government storage 
rooms. 
The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee 
for the White House, to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange 
ways to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living Presidents 
on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes 
no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee, headed by Henry 
Francis Du Pont, contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats.

The press releases emanating from the White House give 
a clue to the activity within. A curator has been appointed. A valuable 
pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore 
Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein 
and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute 
of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library. Secretary 
and Mrs& Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire 
furniture, including Dolley Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room 
in that style. And part of a fabulous collection of <vermeil> hollowware, 
bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs& Margaret 
Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display 
in the State dining room.   Woman's place is in the home: 
man must attend to matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems 
to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just 
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Congress had 
already appropriated money, and plans were well along to tear down the 
buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one 
critic calls the "marble monumentality" of government office buildings. 
While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to 
preserve the Belasco Theater, as well as the Dolley Madison and the 
Benjamin Taylor houses, all scheduled for razing.   What to 
do about it now that he was President? Only a few days after moving 
into the White House. Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square. 
Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem 
to him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided it 
didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.   The situation 
involved some political perils. One of the offices slated for reconstruction 
is the aged Court of Claims, diagonally across the street 
from the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown. But 
Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court, is an elderly 
gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk 
to work. More importantly, he also happens to be the brother-in-law 
of Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.   There were aesthetic 
problems as well as political. On delving deeper, Walton discovered 
that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified 
as "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over which many 
people had grown sentimental, was only a shell of its former self 
after arduous years as a ~USO Center. The Dolley Madison House, 
Walton concluded, was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt 
to save the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half a 
century too late". 
Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious and beautiful. The 
buildings are mostly Georgian. The Dartmouth student does not live 
in monastic seclusion, as he once did. But his is still a simple life 
relatively free of the female presence or influence, and he must go 
far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated pleasures. He is 
still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence, if he chooses to be.

He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the 
last century, down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal 
for book learning in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's 
Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven. 
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend, 
toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke, are no less rakish than 
those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia. But there has 
always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate 
and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment. No one 
here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie 
probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League. It even affects 
the faculty.   Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival- 
widely recognized as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend 
anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup, 
Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter 
garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been 
acquired from a Smith girl. President Dickey's golden retriever, 
frolicking in the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine 
informality.   This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up 
again in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour, wearing 
ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival. 
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown 
on her head. So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.

Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal 
<sang-froid>. For example, groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut 
River. This is in honor of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped 
a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in 
his own student days. And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated 
today. They are hailed by the nation's press, and Smith girls throng 
the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the <voyageurs> with 
hot soup and kisses.   Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic 
recreation is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand 
pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United 
States, the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team 
as another name for their own. Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant 
member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union, which includes the winter 
sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country.   Dartmouth 
students ski everywhere in winter, starting with their own front 
door. They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him, or move 
out to Oak Hill, where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway, 
at Holt's Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the best 
terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.   Forty 
miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's own mountain. 
Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President Dickey acts as host every 
year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth 
Outing Club to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn 
virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining, sleeping, or 
lounging in its huge living room. The Outing Club also owns a chain 
of fourteen cabins and several shelters, extending from the Vermont 
hills, just across the river from the college, through Hanover to the 
College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in 
the logging country. The cabins are equipped with bunks, blankets, 
and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips. 
The club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of the students 
prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting, 
fishing, climbing, or skiing.   Under the auspices of the Outing 
Club, Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes 
on tough climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose interests 
are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's Team, which 
competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and 
chopping, 
canoe races, and the like.   There is much to be said for a college 
that, while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives 
its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along 
back roads where a glimpse of small game, deer, or even bear is not 
uncommon. City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle 
or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly in a backwoods 
logging camp. And on the summit of Mount Washington, where thirty-five 
degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered 
higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of wisdom 
to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas "because 
it is there".   There is much to be said for such a college- 
and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too 
loudly. Their affection for their college home has even caused President 
Dickey to comment on this "place loyalty" as something rather 
specially Hanoverian.   Probably a lawyer once said it best for 
all time in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in the 
nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about 
for a way to found its own state university. It fixed on Dartmouth College, 
which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered. The 
legislators decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war 
with the college trustees over the control of classrooms, faculty, 
and chapel. For a time there were two factions on the campus 
fighting for possession of the student body.   The struggle was 
resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing 
cases in our judicial history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating 
the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters. A lawyer, 
hired by the college, was arguing specifically for Dartmouth: 
Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made her plight the dramatic focus 
of his whole plea. In an age of oratory, he was the king of orators, 
and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly 
tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax:   "It 
is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those 
who love it **h".   Dartmouth is today still a small college- 
and still a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.   This 
is not out of keeping with its origins, probably the most humble of 
any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock, a Presbyterian minister, 
founded the school in 1769, naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth, 
its sponsor and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain, 
found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands 
built the first College Hall, a log hut dedicated "for the education 
+ instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, 
writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and 
expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children of Pagans as well 
as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth 
and any others".   It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's 
was indeed "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to 
be 
hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to 
permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first 
Dartmouth commencement in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully 
brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still 
one of the cherished possessions of the college.   The exuberance 
on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings. 
A student orator "produced tears from a great number of the learned" 
even before the punch was served. Then from the branches of a 
near-by tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform and 
the English language, harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue. 
Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green 
beneath the three-hundred-foot pines, and a barrel of rum was broached. 
The cook got drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man 
of broad talents by carving the ox himself.   Future commencements 
were more decorous perhaps, but the number of graduates increased 
from the original four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the 
nineteenth 
century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and Penn 
were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine. 
The dormitories, including the beloved Dartmouth Hall, could barely 
house two hundred students in Spartan fashion.   Then in 1893 
Dr& William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's 
great awakening began. He transformed Dartmouth from a small New 
Hampshire institution into a national college. By 1907 the number of 
undergraduates had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in 
that year, Dr& Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence 
of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the 
college. The presidents of Cornell, Wisconsin, C&C&N&Y&, 
Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard 
and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.

Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today, with approximately 
twenty-nine hundred undergraduates. But it has achieved a 
cross-section of students from almost all the states, and two-thirds of 
its undergraduates come from outside New England. Over 450 different 
schools are usually represented in each entering class. Only a dozen 
or so schools send as many as six students, and there are seldom more 
than fifteen men in any single delegation. About two-thirds of the 
boys now come from public schools.   It is still a college only 
and not a university; it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy 
group. However, three distinguished associated graduate schools offer 
professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical School (third oldest 
in the country and founded in 1797), the Thayer School of Engineering, 
and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. All 
three are purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment of 
about two hundred.   All three schools coordinate their educational 
programs with that of the undergraduate college and, like the college 
proper, 
place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation 
for specialized study. Students of the college who are candidates 
for the A&B& degree and can satisfy the academic requirements 
of the medical and business schools, may enter either of these associated 
schools at the beginning of senior year, thus completing the 
two-year postgraduate course in one year. The Thayer School offers 
a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins 
a B&S& in engineering.   So Dartmouth is moving closer 
to the others in the Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member 
of the League, if not in years at least in the catching up it has 
had to do. It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span 
the other Ivies have enjoyed. However much football has been over-emphasized, 
the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by 
the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its record a thought again 
since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth 
had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national 
recognition.   It has come on with a rush in more significant areas. 
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions 
might consider somewhat breathtaking. But Dartmouth preserves 
its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes, and, although 
some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage, they 
make for lively copy.   President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed 
to corral an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover. 
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified. It was 
a busy street, conveniently near the shopping center, and unattended 
horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.   There are, 
of course, many weaknesses in any case against Emma. She didn't like 
her stepmother, but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before 
the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had no 
way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed. 
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized 
during her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy, 
the stableman might have recognized her. If police had checked on 
her more thoroughly than is indicated, she would be completely eliminated 
as a suspect. ##

Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate 
popular suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden 
home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him, 
although he clearly intended to stay overnight, if not longer.

Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were 
in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders, she had been 
disturbed by their voices and had closed her door, even though it was 
a very hot day.   It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything 
she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse. At that 
time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S& Phillips. 
A few years ago, not too long before his death, Phillips revealed 
in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders. 
He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that 
day, information which must have come from Lizzie. It was obviously 
the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door.

The New Bedford <Standard-Times> has reported Knowlton 
as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew what Borden said 
during his conversation with Morse, he would have convicted "somebody". 
Notice, Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a 
conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have convicted 
"somebody".   It is known that Morse did associate with 
a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at 
Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were a vagabond lot 
and considered to be shady and undesirable characters. Fall River police 
did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against 
Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from 
among these men. These officers found no incriminating information.

Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He said he 
returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar. The woman 
in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said 
she left when he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a 
fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve noon. If this woman 
had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping, she would have 
had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was 
eaten at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse told the woman 
it was 11:20, but it could have been earlier, since she did serve 
dinner on time. Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi. 
They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he 
had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger. Questioned 
further, Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding 
on the same car with him. The conductor did recall having priests 
as passengers and this satisfied police, although the conductor also 
pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests 
riding on almost every trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement 
really proved nothing.   We do know that Morse left the house 
before nine o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through the 
side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door. 
From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked 
leisurely to where his niece was staying, more than a mile away. 
He met nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting of his movements 
in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs& 
Borden was killed.   Morse testified that while he was having 
breakfast in the dining room, Mrs& Borden told the servant, "Bridget, 
I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's testimony 
was in direct contradiction. She said it was after she returned 
from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs& Borden told 
her to wash the windows. This was long after Morse had left the house.

Morse's knowledge of what Mrs& Borden told Bridget could 
indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden 
there. He knew the house fairly well, he had been there on two previous 
visits during the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's 
attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than 
a drum, this was not true. The screen door was unlocked for some ten 
or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back. It was unlocked 
all the time she was washing windows. Morse could have returned 
openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room 
he had occupied. Mrs& Borden would not have been alarmed if she 
saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm 
the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet 
at the farm. Mrs& Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him 
and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she 
could cry out. He could have left for Weybosset Street after her 
murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.   If 
he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return, he could 
have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr& Borden came 
home. With Lizzie in the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget 
upstairs in her attic room, he would have had free and easy access to 
the house. With the second murder over, he could have left, hidden the 
weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood. 
His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, 
with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding 
the side door, was odd. There was no close examination of his 
clothes for bloodstains, and certainly no scientific test was made of 
them. And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing, 
a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.

The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was 
no financial gain for Morse in the murders.   On the other side 
of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with 
whom she was staying. The time would have been shortly after the 
murder of Mrs& Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior. 
He said he had promised Mrs& Borden to return in time for dinner 
and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden 
house. ##

What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible 
suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:   "The 
police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr& Morse as in 
possession of guilty knowledge. Neither had any interest in the deaths; 
indeed, it was probably to Mr& Morse's advantage to have 
Mr& and Mrs& Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated 
by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion of Bridget 
Sullivan as a possible suspect.   Although Pearson disbelieved 
almost everything Lizzie said, and read a sinister purpose into almost 
everything she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget 
as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be said about the 
servant girl.   The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration, 
but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported in the 
testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer had asked Lizzie 
if she suspected her Uncle Morse, and she replied she didn't 
think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned 
after them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie 
pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her 
room 
before her father's murder and came down when she called her.

Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told police about 
the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some 
weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of 
town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner. 
And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington, she also did not 
accuse him. At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew 
anybody her father had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings 
toward 
her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has not been 
friendly with him. They have not been friendly for years". Asked 
who this was, she named Harrington. Her statement certainly was true; 
the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview, 
but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the 
killer.   When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up pears 
in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in the household besides 
Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the 
murders. He said he had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget 
Sullivan"? I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there", 
he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant 
she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed 
at the time of the murders.   Everyone somehow manages to overlook 
completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two 
people in and about the house at the time of both murders: Lizzie 
Borden and Bridget Sullivan.   All the officials on the case 
seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was 
concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of 
servants who have murdered their employers. True, it is no longer cricket 
for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing 
here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters 
and situations.   The actions of Bridget should be examined, 
since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her 
innocence. There are also other factors that require closer examination.

The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes 
the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the 
trial with a "big bundle" of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping 
her mouth shut. The people who believe and retell the legend have 
apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know 
that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to 
the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget did get any bundles of cash, 
the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would 
have been Lizzie Borden.   Bridget was born in Ireland, one 
of fourteen children. She was apparently the pioneer in her family because 
she had no close relatives in this country at that time. She worked 
as a domestic, first in Newport for a year, and then in South 
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for another year. She finally settled in Fall 
River and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs& Reed, was 
hired by the Bordens.   I have previously described how, during 
the week of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing 
and ironing clothes. 
Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in 
the famous introduction to the <Scarlet Letter> as one of those who 
came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor 
of the port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr& Upton possessed 
intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a devoted Christian. 
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical 
subjects. Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad 
interests.   There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood 
had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye, a retentive memory, 
and a critical faculty. When she was nine years old, she wrote 
a description of a store she had visited. She named 48 items, and said 
there were "many more things which it would take too long to write". 
An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years of age quoted the 
Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada, 
and the views of George Washington.   Lucy Upton was graduated 
from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and 
Elmira, were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning 
that could not be denied.   A picture of her in high school comes 
from a younger schoolmate, Albert S& Flint, friend of her brother 
Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer. He recalled 
Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly 
through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little 
recitation room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive 
mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected 
to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men. 
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this. With four younger 
children at home, Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after 
the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's comfort 
and stay until he died in 1879. But even so Lucy could not give up 
her intellectual pursuits. When her brother Winslow became a student 
at Brown University in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history 
he was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof& Diman's 
definition of civilization, and take the world through, is its progress 
ever onward, or does it retrograde at times? Do you think I 
might profitably study some of the history you do, perhaps two weeks 
behind you **h". And that she proceeded to do.   Many years later 
(on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon 
to be graduated from Smith College: "While I love botany which, 
after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods 
of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating 
to take up zoology in the way you are doing. Whatever was the 
science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite 
study. Mathematics came next".   Her study of history 
was persistently pursued. She read Maitland's <Dark Ages>, "which 
I enjoyed very much"; La Croix on the <Customs of the Middle 
Ages>; 16 chapters of Bryce "and liked it more and more"; 
more chapters of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's <Eastern Church>. 
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions 
that came to her as she studied alone.   Lucy's correspondence 
with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken 
up with academic studies. She played chess with him by postcard. 
Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could 
make the most words from the letters in "importunately". Who won 
is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 
1,212 words.   There was another family interest also. Winslow 
had musical talents, as had his father before him. At different times 
he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist. And it was 
Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music 
at Spelman College.   Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown 
University and two years of graduate study, accepted a position 
at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was connected with 
the U&S& Naval Observatory and with the U&S& Signal Corps; 
and after 1883, was professor of astronomy at Brown University. 
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was 
a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as 
to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's death, Lucy 
and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington, 
D&C&. "Their house", writes Albert S& Flint, 
"was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful 
to one like myself far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the 
household. Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor. Winslow, 
as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize 
her as "our iron sister". There is reason to suppose that Lucy 
would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother 
had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about 
to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert S& Flint expressed 
his conviction that "her physical strength, her mental power, her 
lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve 
her fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished career 
amongst the noted women of this country".   While in Washington, 
D&C&, Lucy Upton held positions in the U&S& Census 
Office, and in the Pension Bureau. They were not sufficiently challenging 
however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her 
brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study. After the 
months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church 
and community life.   What was called an "accidental meeting" 
with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman. 
Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence with Miss 
Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came 
to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although 
there was then no money available to pay her a salary. She served for 
a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.

Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship 
and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students; 
of her "great power of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness 
of dress", "her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts 
of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants and birds; 
and her close knowledge of individual students.   She drew 
on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them 
at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on 
her purse as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only 
because of her unobtrusive help.   Under Miss Upton, the work 
of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption. After all, 
she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except 
for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She had taught classes 
in botany, astronomy (with the aid of a telescope), geometry, 
and 
psychology.   Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact, 
had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring minds; and 
both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the 
development of sturdy character and Christian zeal. Both loved the 
out-of-doors, including mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890 
when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss 
Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and "with rare 
executive ability" bore the brunt of "the entire pilgrimage from 
beginning to end". So strenuous it was physically, with its days of 
horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance 
for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived on 
it.   At the Fifteenth 
Anniversary (1896) as already quoted, Miss 
Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future 
as a college of first rank, with expanding and unlimited horizons. 
When Dr& Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined 
to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley 
(April 7, 1923) "**h If you had asked me, I think I would have 
suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton. Her services 
to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I 
have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her".

Such were the qualities of the Acting-President of the Seminary 
after the death of Miss Giles.   At the meeting of the 
Board of Trustees, on March 3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual 
report of the President. She noted that no student had been withdrawn 
through loss of confidence; that the enrollment showed an increase 
of boarding students as was desired; and that the year's work 
had gone forward smoothly. She urged the importance of more thorough 
preparation for admission. The raising of the $25,000 Improvement 
Fund two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous "praise 
demonstration" held afterward on the campus, were reported as 
events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles. With the Fund in 
hand, the debt on the boilers had been paid; Rockefeller and Packard 
Halls had been renovated; walks laid; and ground had been broken 
for the superintendent's home. Miss Upton spoke gratefully of 
the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise 
the Fund, and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly 
needed current expenses. She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the 
many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the 
years had made the work so fruitful in results.   Two bequests 
were recorded: one of $200 under the will of Mrs& Harriet A& 
Copp of Los Angeles; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia 
L& Brett of Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.

Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles 
was "the sorest grief" the Seminary had ever been called upon 
to bear. The daughters of Spelman, she said, had never known or thought 
of Spelman without her. The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier 
had caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles. 
Now the school was indeed bereft. "Yet Spelman has strong, deep roots, 
and will live for the blessing of generations to come". #@# 

Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became ill in 
March, 1910; and when school closed, she was unable to travel to Massachusetts. 
She remained in Atlanta through June and July; she 
died on August sixth.   Before coming on a visit to Spelman 
in 1885, Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and 
her position there was held open for her for a considerable period. But 
she decided to stay at Spelman. She helped with teaching as well 
as office work for a few years- the catalogues show that she had classes 
in geography, rhetoric and bookkeeping. Soon the office work claimed 
all her time. She was closely associated with the Founders in all 
their trials and hardships. Quiet and energetic, cheerful and calm, 
she too was a power in the development of the seminary. Miss Giles 
always used to refer to her as "Sister". She served as secretary 
in the Seminary office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence, 
records, and bookkeeping. The books of the school hold a memorial 
to her; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.

Mary J& Packard, states a <Messenger> editorial, was "efficient, 
pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating the spirit of her 
Master. With infinite patience she responded to every call, no matter 
at what cost to herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to 
have the needed information or word of cheer.

In a few school districts one finds a link between school and 
job. In those vocational programs organized with Smith-Hughes money, 
there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer 
on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other. In these cases 
a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program, saving 
a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12. The apprentice 
program will involve further education on a part-time basis, usually 
at night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high 
school. These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such 
crafts as auto mechanics, carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die 
work, and sheet-metal work.   Formally organized vocational 
programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to 
gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time 
job on graduation. The "diversified occupations" program is a 
part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on 
a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business 
employers. The "distributive education" program operates in 
a similar way, with arrangements between the school and employers in 
merchandising 
fields. In both cases the student attends school half-time 
and works in a regular job the other half. He receives remuneration 
for his work. In a few places cooperative programs between schools 
and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing 
the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are 
immediately marketable upon graduation.   Adult education courses, 
work-study programs of various sorts- these are all evidence of 
a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities 
for out-of-school youth. In general, however, it may be said 
that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school, the school authorities 
play little or no part in the decision of what happens next. If the 
student drops out of high school, the break with the school is even 
more complete. When there is employment opportunity for youth, this 
arrangement- or lack of arrangement- works out quite well. Indeed, 
in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities 
have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were 
potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and 
went to work. Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation, 
although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in 
retrospect may have been a wise one. I make no attempt to measure the 
enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work 
on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business 
which he entered. He may or may not be "better off" than his 
classmate who went on to a college and professional school. But in 
the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all 
the potential professional talent.   In a later chapter dealing 
with the suburban school, I shall discuss the importance of arranging 
a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any 
high school where he is found. In the Negro neighborhoods and also 
to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of 
identification and motivation. High motivation towards higher education 
must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches 
grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are 
essential for academic work. Undoubtedly far more can be done in the 
lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools. However, the teacher 
can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family 
is anti-intellectual. And the fact remains that there are today few 
shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership. 
This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern 
universities. Quite the contrary, as I can testify from personal 
experience as a former university president. Rather we see here 
another vicious circle. The absence of successful Negroes in the world 
of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among 
Negro youth for academic careers. I believe the situation is improving, 
but the success stories need to be heavily publicized. Here again 
we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated 
as Negroes in the press. How can the vicious circle be broken? This 
is a problem to which leaders of opinion, both Negro and white, 
should devote far more attention. It is at least as important as the 
more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South. 

#VOCATIONAL EDUCATION#

I should like to underline four points 
I made in my first report with respect to vocational education. First 
and foremost, vocational courses should not replace courses which 
are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation. Second, 
vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and 
not require more than half the student's time in those years; however, 
for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to 
begin earlier. Third, the significance of the vocational courses is 
that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work; they realize 
the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers, and this 
sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they 
are studying at the same time. Fourth, the type of vocational training 
programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the 
general locality. This last point is important because if high school 
pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain 
vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training, 
the whole idea of relevance disappears. Vocational training which 
holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable 
skill becomes just another school "chore" for those whose interest 
in their studies has begun to falter. Those who, because of population 
mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees, 
would limit vocational education to general rather than specific 
skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind 
of school experience.   I have been using the word "vocational" 
as a layman would at first sight think it should be used. I intend 
to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys 
and girls. These courses develop skills other than those we think of 
when we use the adjective "academic". Practically all of these practical 
skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained 
in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at 
once on the basis of the skill. They are in this sense skills marketable 
immediately on graduation from high school. To be sure, in tool-and-die 
work and in the building trades, the first job must be often 
on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time vocational training 
enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status. 
Similarly, a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography 
and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job 
at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two 
of further study in a community college or secretarial school. Of course, 
it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and 
with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill. So, too, is the 
mathematical 
competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics. 
In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be 
considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student 
in his vocation (which may be a profession) will be called upon to use 
some of the skills developed and the competence obtained. In spite 
of the shading of one type of course into another, I believe it is useful 
to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses. 
Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which 
proves the rule. Today many college bound students try to take a 
course in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of mastery of 
this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work 
in college and a professional school.   Most of our largest 
cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools. 
In this respect, public education in the large cities differs from education 
in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts. The 
neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking, comprehensive schools, 
because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational 
or technical high school instead of the local school. Indeed, one 
school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term 
comprehensive 
high school for the senior high schools in his city, because 
these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs. He prefers 
to designate such schools as "general" high schools. The suburban 
high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely comprehensive 
high school because of the absence of vocational programs. The reason 
is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community. Therefore 
employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan 
area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic 
of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.

The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities 
must be reckoned as permanent institutions. By and large their programs 
are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and 
to the realities of the apprentice system. It is not often realized 
to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of 
employment, except for a lucky few. One has to talk confidentially with 
some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a 
boy cannot just say, "I want to be a plumber", and then, by doing 
good work, find a job. It is far more difficult in many communities 
to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval 
than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation. 
Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind. One vocational instructor 
in a city vocational school, speaking of his course in a certain 
field, said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs <outside> 
of the city. In the city, he said, the waiting list for those 
who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside 
track he can't get in. In a far distant part of the United States, 
I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade 
was doing special work. "What does he have in mind to do when he 
graduates"? "Oh, he'll be a plumber", came the answer. "But 
isn't it almost impossible to get into the union"? I asked. 
"He'll have no difficulty", I was told. "He has very good 
connections".   In my view, there should be a school which offers 
significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every 
family in a city. Ideally these schools should be so located that 
one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is 
at the highest.   An excellent example of a successful location 
of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School 
in Chicago. Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment, 
this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational 
aims of its students. Hardly a window has been broken since 
Dunbar 
first was opened (and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many 
slum areas). I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost 
all the pupils were Negroes. They were learning trades as diverse 
as shoe repairing, bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics, 
and airplane mechanics. The physical facilities at Dunbar are 
impressive, but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils.

The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the 
world. In the United States, where half of the world crop is grown, 
soybeans are processed for their edible oil. The residue from soybean 
processing goes mainly into animal feeds.   Soybeans are extensively 
processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient. 
American chemists, seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have 
adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their 
use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh 
of Indonesia. Soybean flour, grits, flakes, "milk", and curd can 
be bought in the United States.   Peanuts are the world's 
second most important legume. They are used mainly for their oil. We 
produce peanut oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed. 
Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating 
as nuts, are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off.

Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans, 
comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of 
Asia and Africa.   In western Europe and North America, where 
the level of economic development is higher, grains and other seed 
products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed. Rather, 
meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy products are the main sources of 
carbohydrate, 
protein, oils, and fats. People depend less on seeds for 
foods in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive grazing 
lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption of meat is high.

Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's 
cereal crop in 1957-1958. Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy 
cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry. About 90 percent 
of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals. The rest 
is used for human food and industrial products. More than half of the 
sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the 
milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.

More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed 
to livestock annually in the United States.   The efficiency 
with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily 
in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased 
feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds 
are processed for oil. ##

THE DEMAND for food is so great in 
the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood 
crops. Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor 
position.   Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial 
uses are the oil-bearing seeds- flax, castor, tung (nuts from 
the China wood-oil tree), perilla (from an Oriental mint), and oiticica 
(from a Brazilian tree).   Oils, or liquid fats, from the 
seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints 
and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood 
and metal. These oils develop hard, smooth films when they dry and form 
resinlike substances.   The artist who paints in oil uses drying 
oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the 
ages. One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds.

Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape yield semidrying 
oils. Some are used in paints along with drying oils. Palm oil 
protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin.

Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out of style as a 
medicine. This nondrying oil, however, is now more in demand than ever 
before as a fine lubricant, as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically 
operated equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.

Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used extensively 
in perfumery to extract flower fragrances. It is still used in drugs 
and cosmetics, but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with 
oils from peach and plum seeds.   Liquid fats from all these 
oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household 
and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives.

Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel oil- seed 
oils that are produced primarily for food purposes- also are used 
to make soaps, detergents, and paint resins.   Solid fats from 
the seeds of the mahua tree, the shea tree, and the coconut palm are used 
to make candles in tropical countries.   Seeds are a main source 
of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world. 
Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada, 
and Australia. In other countries where cereal grains are not 
among the principal crops of a region, starchy tubers or roots are processed 
for starch. Starch is used in the paper, textile, and food-processing 
industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.

Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium (fleawort), flax, 
and locust (carob) seeds in ancient times. Today the yearly import 
into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds; 
of psyllium seed, more than 2.6 million. The discovery during 
the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust 
gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the 
United States.   Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs 
and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners, stabilizers, 
or dispersing agents. Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes 
ice cream. Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting 
lotions. Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium was sold 
in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands. 
Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers 
in making paper. ##

THE SEEDS of hard, fibrous, stony fruits, 
called nuts, provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other materials 
of value. Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel 
and its thick, adherent, brown covering- the seedcoat.   The 
kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts, hazelnuts, hickory 
nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts are predominantly oily. Almonds 
and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein. 
Chestnuts are starchy. All nut kernels are rich in protein. 
The world production of familiar seed nuts- almonds, brazil nuts, 
filberts, and the English walnuts- totals about 300 thousand tons annually.

Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the largest 
of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a 
crop for domestic and export markets. The oil palm of West Africa yields 
edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit. 
World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut, 
was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959. Exports from producing 
countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million 
tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about 
half was palm oil.   Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include 
the spicy nutmeg; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing power 
to natural saponins; the marking nut, used for ink and varnish; the 
aromatic sassafras nut of South America; and the sweet-smelling 
cumara nut, which is suited for perfumes.   A forest crop that has 
not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm. 
The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized 
seed. It is used for making buttons and other small, hard objects of 
turnery. Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and 
faces of dolls sold to tourists. ##

THE COLOR AND SHAPE of 
seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations.

Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from jobs-tears- 
the seeds of an Asiatic grass. Bead tree seeds are the necklaces 
of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba. 
Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.

Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety 
of seeds collected during the year.   Tradition has assigned 
medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils, 
and highly flavored components. Although science has given us more effective 
materials, preparations from anise, castorbean, colchicum, nux 
vomica, mustard, fennel, and stramonium are familiar to many for the 
relief of human ailments. Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still 
are used by some persons.   Peanut and sesame oils often are 
used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection.

Still another 
group of seeds (sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing 
fruits) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the 
nutrients they supply are quite negligible. The common spices, flavorings, 
and condiments make up this group.   Each year millions of 
pounds of anise, caraway, mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils 
extracted from them are imported.   Single-seeded dry fruits used 
for flavoring include several of the carrot family, such as cumin, 
dill, fennel, and angelica. Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages 
include fenugreek (artificial maple flavor) and cardamom. White 
pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit.   Sesame 
seed, which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt, 
Brazil, and Central America, has a toasted-nut flavor and can be 
used in almost any dish calling for almonds. It is a main flavoring for 
halvah, the candy of the Middle East. Sesame sticks, a snack dip, 
originated in the Southwest.   Beverages are made from seeds 
the world over.   Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds 
of the coffee tree. World production of coffee broke all previous 
records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons. Per capita consumption 
remains around 16 pounds in the United States.   Cocoa, 
chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao 
tree. World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between 
Africa (63 percent) and South America (27 percent).   Several 
soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts, the seed of the kola 
tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America.   Cereal 
grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages. 
The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain. Arrack is 
distilled from fermented rice in India.   Beer, generally fermented 
from barley, is an old alcoholic beverage. Beer was brewed by the 
Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago. Brewers 
today use corn, rice, and malted barley.   Distillers use corn, 
malt, wheat, grain sorghum, and rye in making beverage alcohol. ## 

SEED CROPS hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy 
of the United States.   The farm value of seeds produced in this 
country for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly 10 billion 
dollars a year. Cereal grains, oilseeds, and dry beans and peas account 
for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised.

The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater, because 
additional returns are obtained from most of the corn, oats, barley, 
and sorghum- as well as the cake and meal from the processing 
of flaxseed, cottonseed, and soybeans- through conversion to poultry, 
meat, and dairy products.   Seeds furnish about 40 percent of 
the total nutrients consumed by all livestock. Hay and pasture are the 
other chief sources of livestock feed.   Seeds are the essential 
raw materials for milling grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining 
edible oil, brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.   More than 11 
thousand business establishments in the United States were based on 
cereals and oilseeds in 1954. The value of products from these industries 
was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third was created 
by manufacturing processes. Not included was the value of seed oil in 
paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries 
that are based on imported seed or seed products.   Cereal grains 
furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American 
diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock 
and poultry.

To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home 
was called "locatin'" 'em. To keep 'em scattered somewhat 
and yet herd 'em was called "loose herdin'". To hold 'em in 
a compact mass was "close herdin'". Cattle were inclined to remain 
in a territory with which they were acquainted. That became their 
"home range". Yet there were always some that moved farther and 
farther out, seekin' grass and water. These became "strays", 
the term bein' restricted to cattle, however, as hosses, under like 
circumstances, were spoken of as "stray hosses", not merely "strays".

Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it 
was over. You couldn't stop 'em; you had to go with 'em or wait 
till the storm was over, and follow. Such marchin' in wholesale 
numbers was called a "drift", or "winter drift", and if the storm 
was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the 
range. The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number 
of them animals. The single animal or a small bunch were referred 
to as "strays"; but when a large number were "bunched up" 
or "banded up", and marched away from their home range, as long as 
they stayed together the group was said to be a "drift". Drifts 
usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds, 
but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or 
grass because of a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede. Drifts 
usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 
'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.   The wholesale 
death of cattle as a result of blizzards, and sometimes droughts, over 
a wide range of territory was called a "die-up". Followin' such 
an event there was usually a harvest of "fallen hides", and the 
ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons. Cattle 
were said to be "potted" when "blizzard choked", that is, caught 
in a corner or a draw, or against a "drift fence" durin' a 
storm. Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as 
the "winter kill". When cattle in winter stopped and humped their 
backs up they were said to "bow up". This term was also used by 
the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight, as one cowhand was 
heard to say, "He arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm". Cattle 
drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 
'em into prime beef were said to be "double wintered".   Cattle 
brought into a range from a distance were called "immigrants". 
Them new to the country were referred to as "pilgrims". This 
word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle, but later 
was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot. Hereford cattle 
were often called "white faces", or "open-face cattle", 
and the old-time cowman gave the name of "hothouse stock" to them 
newly introduced cattle. Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed, 
they were rarely seen on a ranch, though one might be found now and 
then for the milk supply. The cowboy called this breed of cattle "magpies". 
A "cattaloe" was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and 
cattle. 
"Dry stock" denoted, regardless of age or sex, such bovines 
as were givin' no milk. A "wet herd" was a herd of cattle made 
up entirely of cows, while "wet stuff" referred to cows givin' 
milk. The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a "milk 
pitcher". Cows givin' no milk were knowed as "strippers". 
The terminology of the range, in speakin' of "dry stock" and 
"wet stock", was confusin' to the tenderfoot. The most common reference 
to "wet stock" was with the meanin' that such animals had 
been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their 
rightful owners. The term soon became used and applied to all stolen 
animals. "Mixed herd" meant a herd of mixed sexes, while a "straight 
steer herd" was one composed entirely of steers, and when the 
cowman spoke of "mixed cattle", he meant cattle of various grades, 
ages, and sexes.   In the spring when penned cattle were turned 
out to grass, this was spoken of as "turn-out time", or "put 
to grass". "Shootin' 'em out" was gettin' cattle out of 
a corral onto the range. When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' 
run she was said to "come out a-stoopin'". To stir cattle 
up and get 'em heated and excited was to "mustard the cattle", and 
the act was called "ginnin' 'em 'round", or "chousin' 
'em". After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands 
toward their home range was called "throwin' over". 
A cow rose from the ground rear end first. By the time her hindquarters 
were in a standin' position, her knees were on the ground in a prayin' 
attitude. It was when she was in this position that the name 
"prayin' cow" was suggested to the cowboy. They were said to be 
"on their heads" when grazin'. "On the hoof" was a reference 
to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' 
by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail. Shippin' 
cattle by train was called a "stock run". A general classification 
given grass-fed cattle was "grassers".   When a cowboy 
spoke of "dustin'" a cow, he meant that he throwed dust into her 
eyes. The cow, unlike a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her 
mind on her business when chargin', and a cow "on the prod" or "on 
the peck" was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other 
charges.   The Injun's name for beef was "wohaw", and many 
of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun 
on the trails. The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white 
man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters. Listenin' 
with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted 
"Whoa", "Haw", and "Gee", they thought them words the 
names of the animals, and began callin' cattle "wohaws". Rarely 
did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north 
that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for "wohaw".   "Tailin'" 
was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a 
rope. Any animal could when travelin' fast, be sent heels over head 
by the simple process of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail, 
and givin' the latter a pull to one side. This throwed the animal 
off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders. Though 
the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results, many 
men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle 
horn, supplemented sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave 
of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail. Such tactics were 
resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns, and a thorough 
"tailin'" usually knocked the breath out of a steer, and so dazed 
'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day. It required both 
a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider. When cattle became more 
valuable, ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued, 
at least when the boss was 'round. When the cowboy used the word 
"tailin's", he meant stragglers.   "Bull tailin'" 
was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas. From 
a pen of wild bulls one would be released, and with much yellin' a 
cowhand'd take after 'im. Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed 
his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin' the bull off 
balance, and "bustin'" 'im with terrific force. Rammin' one 
horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called 
"peggin'".   Colors of cattle came in for their special names. 
An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was 
called a "brindle" or "brockle". A "lineback" was an animal 
with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' 
down its back, while a "lobo stripe" was the white, yeller, or 
brown stripe runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic 
of many Spanish cattle. A "mealynose" was a cow or steer of 
the longhorn type, with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest 
of its body 'round the eyes, face, and nose. Such an animal was 
said to be "mealynosed". "Sabinas" was a Spanish word used to 
describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'. 
The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up 
the trail "Sonora reds", while they called all cattle drove up from 
Mexico "yaks", because they came from the Yaqui Injun country, 
or gave 'em the name of "Mexican buckskins". Near the southern 
border, cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black 
with a lineback, with white speckles frequently appearin' on the 
sides and belly, were called "zorrillas". This word was from the 
Spanish, meanin' "polecat". "Yeller bellies" were cattle 
of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color. An 
animal with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished 
and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes used as a 
"marker". Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the 
rustler.   Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was 
found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with 
the uncounted cattle was called a "range count". The countin' 
of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose 
was called a "pasture count". The counters rode through the 
pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted it back 
so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead. This 
method of countin' was usually done at the request, and in the presence, 
of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the 
herd. Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as "cattle paper".

A "book count" was the sellin' of cattle by the books, 
commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes much to the profit of 
the seller. This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the 
"books won't freeze". This became a common byword durin' the 
boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle 
interests. The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper 
by the name of Luke Murrin. His saloon was a meetin' place for 
influential Wyoming cattlemen, and one year durin' a severe blizzard, 
when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces, he said, 
"Cheer up boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze". In 
this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' 
custom of buyin' by book count, and created a sayin' which has survived 
through the years. "Range delivery" meant that the buyer, after 
examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation 
for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed to own, 
then rode out and tried to find it.   When a cowhand said that a 
man had "good cow sense", he meant to pay 'im a high compliment. 
No matter by what name cattle were called, there was no denyin' that 
they not only saved Texas from financial ruin, but went far toward 
redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest. #@ 
21 @ SWINGIN' A WIDE LOOP#

THE first use of the word 
"rustler" was as a synonym for "hustler", becomin' an established 
term for any person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in 
any enterprise. Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler, 
and when the order was given to go out and "rustle the hosses", 
it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in. Eventually herdin' 
the hosses was spoken of as "hoss rustlin'", and the wrangler was 
called the "hoss rustler". Later, the word became almost exclusively 
applied to a cow thief, startin' from the days of the maverick 
when cowhands were paid by their employers to "get out and rustle 
a few mavericks". 
IT WAS JOHN who found the lion tracks. He found them near the carcass 
of a zebra that had been killed the night before, and he circled 
once, nose to the ground, hair shooting up along his back, as it did 
when he was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head and bayed, 
and the pack joined in, all heads high, and Jones knew it was a hot 
trail.   He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him 
straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain. This mountain was 
known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about 
two hundred feet, honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub 
and creepers and tall grass. On the south it ended sharply as though 
the lava had been cut off there suddenly.   Kearton and Ulyate 
had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs, and Means 
and Loveless had taken another route, and now, with the discovery 
of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined in, in the 
shadow of the Reef and pointed. Kearton focussed his field glasses.

"That's the Colonel", he said, "But I can't see the 
dogs".   As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef. 
Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front 
of him. The dogs were working a trail- lion? hyena? The pack 
had made a bend to the north, swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton 
and Ulyate could hear them faintly.   Kearton got off and 
tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled 
it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless 
and Means and the rest of the party.   "Not yet", cautioned 
Ulyate.   Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern 
toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly, Old John 
with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others. There 
was Sounder, too, also a veteran of the North Rim, and Rastus and 
the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London 
pound, and Simba, a terrier **h. A motley pack, chosen for effectiveness, 
not beauty. Jones was galloping close behind them leaning 
down, cheering them on.   "Light it"! Ulyate said, and Kearton 
touched a match to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked 
out. He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column of smoke rose.

"That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we 
are".   Two quick shots sounded. Then there was a chorus of 
wild barking and baying. Then the heavy roar of a lion.   Kearton 
and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound. 
It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away. At the 
base of the rocky hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot. 
The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers and bushes, so 
thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called, 
Ulyate answered from ten feet away. Nice country to meet a lion in 
face to face. Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the 
barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion, till they 
came, out of breath, to the crest, and peering through the branches of 
a bush, this is what Ulyate saw: Jones who had apparently (and actually 
had) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside, sitting calmly on 
his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness, who was crouched 
on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the 
dogs whirled around her.   Ulyate drew back with a start, and put 
finger to lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her 
off, "The dogs have got her bayed **h. She's just the other side 
of that bush"! And when they had drawn back a step he added: 
"Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her. Why she doesn't 
charge him, I don't know. And he hasn't even got a knife on 
him. He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground **h. Careful, 
don't disturb her". ##

Jones had been about a hundred 
and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the 
Reef. She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when 
she saw him she rose to full height and roared, opening her mouth wide, 
lashing her tail, and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in 
irritation, as much as to say: "How dare you disturb me in my sacred 
precinct"?   Intuition told him, however, that she was tired 
and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge, yet. He 
moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her, being careful, because 
he knew the female is less predictable than the male. (In the graveyard 
at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game 
hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso. 
Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed by lions, and eleven out 
of the seventeen by lionesses.) She snarled terribly but intuition 
told 
him, again, that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her 
attention was distracted by the dogs. He threw the lasso. It was falling 
over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front 
of her on the rock. Even then, if she took one step forward he could 
catch her. But John nipped her rear end- one lion's rear end 
was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona no matter- and she 
changed ends and took a swipe at John, but he ducked back.   Jones 
then recoiled his rope and threw again, this time hitting her on 
the back but failing to encircle her. She whirled and faced him, roaring 
terribly, and Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand 
why she did not charge and obliterate him, because he wouldn't 
have much of a chance of getting away, in that thick growth, but she 
seemed just a trace uncertain; while Jones, on the other hand, appeared 
perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.

From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature 
on the back of another creature, lashing out with its long thin paw, 
very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with. But 
now she sank lower to the rock. Her roar changed to a growl. Her 
tail 
no longer lashed. Although she appeared more subdued and defeated, 
Jones knew she was growing more dangerous. She was rested and could 
mount a charge. Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched, 
and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet. 
At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing through the undergrowth 
with their horses, and distracted her, and she ran off a short 
distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks. The dogs followed 
her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.   "We've 
got to get her out of there"! Jones yelled, "or she'll 
kill 'em all. Bring me the firecrackers".   For such an 
emergency he had included Fourth-of-July cannon crackers as part of 
their equipment. Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice, and the 
lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.   "Ain't she 
a beauty, though"? called out Means as she ran.   "Don't 
you go a step nearer her than I do", Jones warned, "and if 
you do, go at a run so you'll have momentum"!   For two hours 
they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of 
the Reef, trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get 
a good throw. But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore 
away. It was hot. The dogs were tired. The men were tired too. It 
was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again. And the sun was 
beginning to go down. If dark came they would lose her.   "I'll 
get a pole", Jones said finally, "and I'll poke a noose 
over her 
head"!   At this moment she was crouched in a cave-like 
aperture halfway down the Reef. Ulyate made no comment but his face 
showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles, 
and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago, not the gentler 
ones of today, and this one was angry, with good reason. Loveless, 
too, objected. "It won't work, Colonel".   "Just the 
same we'll try it".   But without waiting for them to try it, 
she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain.

John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out 
behind, many of them trailing blood. John himself was bruised and 
clawed from head to tail, but he was in this fight to the finish, running 
almost as strongly now as in the morning.   She took refuge 
on a tongue of land extending into a gully, crouched at the base of a 
thorn tree, and waited for them to come up. She had chosen the spot well. 
With the gully on three sides, she could be approached only along 
the tongue of land. "Careful, now", Jones warned.   Means 
tried her first. Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding, 
edging closer, watching for a chance to throw, but ready to spin and 
run, rope whining about his head, horse edging tensely under him, but 
the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close 
proximity of the lion. They tell you horses go crazy at the sight 
or smell of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.   Means edged 
closer. She snarled warningly. Means spit and edged on. Again she 
snarled, and again he edged. The pony was sidewise to her. With a whirling 
jump, it could get into gear **h. However nothing on four legs 
was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance, unless 
it was a cheetah.   She charged. Means spun and spurred. For thirty 
yards she gained rapidly. She was closing and within one more bound 
would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay, but- and 
here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they 
were worth- she never quite caught up that last bound. Means held 
steady one jump ahead of her. Then gradually he began to pull away. 
A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion, from a standing start. 
Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means **h. 
Of course the factor of head start made all the difference. How much 
head start? No one knew exactly. That was the whole question. 
Enough, was the answer.   The lioness quickly changed front, when 
she saw she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones. As she had 
done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but then Baldy began 
to draw away. Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the 
determining point.   When Jones too drew away, she returned to 
a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched low 
and waited as before. This new position, however, gave the ropers a 
better chance. There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and 
throw as you went. So: Means edged around on the north side of her, 
Jones moved in from the south. Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted 
her attention. He succeeded almost too well, because once she 
rose as if to charge, and he half wheeled his horse- he was within 
fifty feet- but she sank back.   From behind her Means shot 
forward at a run. Kearton began shouting, "Wait, wait- the camera's 
jammed"! But Means kept on. He raced by within twenty feet 
of her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck is short and 
thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off. 
The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was 
once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies. But the time 
came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was 
looked upon as deficient in its essential life. The Christian education 
of children, too, was once hardly more than a sideshow, but the day 
came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church 
school was thought of as failing in its duty.   The most serious 
weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally 
regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination 
and a few interdenominational executives. Most pastors and laymen, 
even though they believe it to be important, assume that the ecumenical 
movement lies outside the province of their parishes. They may 
even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the 
"ecclesiastical Rover Boys", as someone has dubbed them, who like 
to go to national and international assemblies, and have expense accounts 
that permit them to do so.   As long as this point of view 
prevails, the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt. The next 
stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community. 
Progress will take place far less through what is done in any 
"summit conference" of the National Council or the World Council, 
or even in offices of the denominational boards, than through what 
happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors. 
The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping 
congregations of different traditions exist side by side. Until they 
see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their 
own attitudes, programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable 
aspect of unreality. As things now stand, there is a grievous disparity 
between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings 
and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main 
Street in the nation. 

#THE ECUMENICAL CONGREGATION#

The crux 
of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation 
between congregations in the same community. The decisive question 
is what happens <within> each congregation and, finally, in the 
minds and hearts of the individual members. It is here that the local 
and ecumenical must meet. It is here that the ecumenical must become 
local and the local become ecumenical.   It has become almost 
trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be "carried down to the 
grass roots". This way of describing the matter is unfortunate. 
It implies two misconceptions. One is that whatever is ecumenical has 
to do with some over-all organization at "the top" and needs only 
to be understood at the so-called "lower levels". The truth, however, 
is that the ecumenical church <is> just the local church in its 
own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God 
throughout the world. The other misconception is that our ecumenical 
problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide 
extension and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended 
by many national leaders, can be communicated to all congregations. 
However needed this may be, the fundamental problem is not information 
but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ 
in the world.   The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational 
polity, is always the congregation. It is hardly possible 
to emphasize this too much. Most people do not realize that the congregation, 
as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face, personally 
sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience 
in daily relationships with one another, is unique. The idea that it 
is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken. The Jewish synagogue 
affords a parallel to the Christian congregation, but Hinduism, 
Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, although they 
have sacred scriptures, priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of 
prayer, do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and 
love. Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an 
altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with 
a distinctive kind of fellowship.   How far the fellowship in most 
local churches falls below what the New Testament means by <koinonia!> 
What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more 
than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind 
of people one likes. The <koinonia> of Acts and of the Epistles 
means sharing in a common relation to Christ. It is an experience of 
a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate 
indwelling of Christ in His people. As Dietrich Bonho^ffer puts 
it, "Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ 
has done to both of us". This may mean having fellowship in the church 
with people with whom, on the level of merely human agreeableness, 
we might prefer not to have any association at all. There is a vast 
difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament 
describes and the community of congeniality found in the average 
church building.   Whenever a congregation really sees itself 
as a unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with the whole 
Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world, a necessary 
foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid. The 
antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists. The 
local and the ecumenical are one.   Of course, the perspective 
of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the 
People of God will always be different from the perspective of those 
who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a 
particular place. Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related 
to the other. Neither is adequate if it stands alone. Our difficulty 
arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other. And this is what 
all too often happens. 

#DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES#

A little parable 
illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor 
Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War. With great 
difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew 
his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World 
Council of Churches. When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles, 
his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new 
ones. They were bifocals. He often spoke of them as his "ecumenical" 
glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is 
required in the church. It is, he said, a bifocal vision, which can 
see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right 
relation to both.   As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical 
tend to compete with each other. On the one hand, there are 
ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter 
with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church 
is doing in their own town. They do not escape the pitfall into which 
Charles Dickens pictured Mrs& Jellyby as falling. Her concern 
for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite 
forgot and neglected her son Peepy! Likewise, the ecumenist may become 
so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian 
state in East Germany, the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary 
China, and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South 
Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its 
unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service 
and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.

On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering 
to the intimate, personal needs of individuals in his congregation 
that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social 
responsibility and world mission. As a result, they go on thinking 
of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction, only 
in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families. 
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of 
the energy of most churches- whether in terms of finance or spiritual 
concern- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the 
members. The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or 
the world.   The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the 
parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable 
suburbs. It is eminently successful according to all conventional 
standards. It is growing in numbers. Its people are agreeable 
friends. It has a beautiful edifice. Its preaching and its music give 
refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain. It 
provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled. It helps children 
grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible. It draws 
young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the 
church from generation to generation. And it is easy for the ecumenical 
enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.   But what 
is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians 
in the world? All too often its conception of parish ministry 
and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation 
to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind. 
It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with 
the mind of Christ. It is not helping them face the moral crisis 
involved in the use of nuclear energy. It is not making them sensitive 
to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial 
life. It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship 
means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world 
to economically underdeveloped peoples. It is not developing an awareness 
of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young 
churches emerge in Asia and Africa.   To put it bluntly, many 
a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want. 
It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility 
in relation to the world. We shall not make a decisive advance 
in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not 
merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness 
and mission to the world.   There is a humorous but revealing 
story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted 
to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant 
community. He built a school and a library, then a recreation center 
and an inn. Desiring to fill the only remaining lack, he selected 
the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting 
it. A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired, "Do 
you belong to this church, Mr& Rancher"? "Why, no, ma'am", 
he replied, "this church belongs to me"! The story reflects 
the way too many people feel. As long as the congregation regards 
the church as "our" church, or the minister thinks of it as "my" 
church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant 
advance. There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs 
not to us but to Christ, and that it is His purpose, not our own interests 
and preferences, that determines what it is to be and do. 

#LOCAL 
EMBODIMENT OF THE WHOLE#

A local church which conceives its function 
to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and 
concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an 
extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church. It would 
doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical 
it is really failing to be the Church of Christ.   Yet the 
truth, according to the New Testament, is that every local church 
has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in 
that particular place. 
Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match 
the boys from the neighboring farms; and buggies and wagons and chugging 
Fords kept gathering all morning, until the edges of the field 
were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field 
to make fun of the visitors- whose pitcher was a formidable looking 
young man with the only baseball cap.   This was a bitterly 
fought game, carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight, with no 
friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness 
that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls 
that went into the crowd. Every pitch in the game brought forth 
a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors 
dropped (and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from 
drink, they dropped many) called forth yelps of derision.   At 
one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting 
as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in 
the kidneys, he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled 
over whether the ball was "dead" or the base runners were 
free to score.   This was typical of such games, which were earnestly 
played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of 
good fellowship. When the visitors, after losing this game, rode along 
the village streets toward home, the youngsters who could keep abreast 
of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, "You bunch of 
hay-shakers! G'ahn back home! You hay-shakers"!   Baseball 
was surely the national game in those days, even though professional 
baseball may have been merely a business. Radio broadcasts had 
not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home, 
in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or three trips to the 
city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or 
the Red Sox.   Young men in school could look forward to playing 
ball for money in a dozen different places, even if they failed to 
make the major leagues. Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might 
find a payday awaiting him in the Three ~I League, or the Pony 
League, or the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League, 
if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere. 
Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams, 
sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores, 
that played two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually in 
the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan audience who 
did not begrudge a quarter each, or even more, to be dropped into a hat 
when the game was half over.   Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's 
hero, and everyone knew him, even though relatively few ever 
saw him play ball. His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes 
in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life. As the twenties grew 
older, and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more 
and more people daily in the doings of the professionals, the great 
hitters (always led by Babe Ruth) overshadowed the game so that pitchers 
were nearly of no account. Boys no longer bothered learning to 
bunt and even school kids scorned to "choke up" on a bat as Willie 
Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.   Other 
hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared 
to dream of matching Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his 
friends, or Leo or Two-Head by those who dared to taunt him (Leo 
was the name of the ball player he liked the least) and who called most 
of the world "Kid". Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster, 
and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs. But the nickname never 
stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in "color"- which is sometimes 
a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field. Ruth 
was a delinquent boy still, but he was in every way a great ball 
player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone 
to do it.   A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities, 
with the encouragement of the press, so that they might 
see their names in big black print, along with Daddy Browning's, 
Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince of Wales'. One 
who, for a time, succeeded 
best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles 
Arthur Shires, who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the 
Great, or The Great Shires. It was his brag that he could beat 
everybody at anything, but especially at fighting, and he once took on 
the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists. 
he was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond; 
and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles 
in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First 
Baseman for some forgotten reason. (This made a sportswriter named 
Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated 
his manager.) The sorry fact about this young man, who was barely 
of age when he broke into major-league baseball, was that he really 
was a better ball player than he was given credit for being- never so 
good as he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates, but a 
good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate 
on his skills or cut up in public.   In his minor way Charles 
Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was, for 
he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these 
Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers. 
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down; 
or who ingested strange objects, like live fish; or who undertook 
to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with or without 
a partner; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without 
pausing for breath. One young man, exhilarated to the point of insanity 
by liquor and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect 
swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-Army 
football game, landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below, 
and died at once.   But the twenties were not all insanity and 
a striving after recognition. The business of baseball began to prosper 
along with other entertainments, and performers- thanks partly to 
George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his 
salary higher and higher- prospered too. While fifty years before, 
Albert Goodwill Spalding, secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of 
the National League, could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo 
club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball 
game in August, in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium 
might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate. And 
while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox- all of them 
top performers in their positions- had toiled for stingy Charles 
Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five 
hundred dollars a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars, 
twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars a season.

The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New 
York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club 
by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins. Boston fans sometimes 
liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the 
great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox- sold to millionaires 
Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most 
trifling desire. Ruth himself, still owning his farm in Massachusetts 
and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed 
his round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade down from Fenway 
Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays, Leslie "Joe" Bush, 
Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam Jones, catcher Wally Schang, 
third baseman Joe Dugan (who completed the "playboy trio" of 
Ruth, Dugan, and Hoyt), and shortstop Everett Scott. By 1926, when 
the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of these were 
left but they still shone brightest, even beside able and agile rookies 
like Tony Lazzeri (who managed never to have one of his epileptic 
fits on the field), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras, and 
gray-thatched Earl Combs. The deeds of this team, through two seasons 
and in the two World's Series that followed, have been written 
and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said. But there 
is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in 
the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to 
recall. Babe Ruth, as he always did in the Stadium, played right field 
to avoid having the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather 
mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St& Louis Cardinals, 
knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the 
permanent stands and the wooden bleachers, where Ruth could not reach 
it. The ball lay there, shining white on the grass in view of nearly 
every fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration, charged 
about the small patch of ground screaming, "Where's the -ing 
ball"? But, as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over, 
"not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me", so little Tommy 
ran all the way home.   The ordinary man and woman, however, saw 
little of the great professional games of those Golden Days, or of 
any other sporting event for that matter. Promoters always hastened 
to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators, 
and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in 
with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest 
of any importance. Radio broadcasts, however- now that even plain 
people could afford "loud speakers" on their sets- held old 
fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones, chiefly women, 
who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition, 
became first inured, then attracted, then addicted to the long 
afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.

In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on 
weekends the announcer was silenced, and fans must needs drive to the 
city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring. 
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well 
as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies, some of which began 
to offer special excursion rates, including seats at the park, just 
as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new. 
While women had always attended ball games in small numbers (it was the 
part of a "dead game sport" in the early years of the twentieth 
century to be taken out to the ball park and to root, root, root for 
the home team), they had often sat in patient martyrdom, unable even to 
read the scoreboard, which sometimes seemed to indicate that one 
team 
led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and 
fifty-one. The questions women asked at baseball games were standard 
grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women automobile drivers; 
for every grown man (except a few who were always suspected of 
being shy on virility) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just 
as every male American in this era liked to imagine (or pretend) that 
he could fight with his fists. And women were not expected to know 
that the pitcher was trying <not> to let the batter hit the ball.

Radio, however, so increased the interest of women in the game 
that it was hardly necessary even to have "Ladies' Days" any longer 
to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home. 
Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where 
they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice 
stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.

The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative, 
despite the baseball jargon, that girls and women could begin to 
store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics 
that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their 
lessons in school. 
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores 
will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the "ideal", 
and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for 
preserving the ideal.   Our discussion of this involves using 
Erik Erikson's schema of "identity <vs&> identity diffusion" 
as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto 
the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers 
from whose case histories we quoted earlier. Our discussion does not 
utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended 
to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying 
unwed mothers. We hope thereby to emphasize that, from a psychological 
standpoint, the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous 
long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy 
through adolescence.   Hypothesizing a series of developmental 
stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old 
age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series 
of identity crises. The successful and positive resolution of these 
crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle- during 
adolescence, the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity 
crisis depend, to a considerable degree, on his already having 
resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy, 
childhood, and early adolescence. Within Erikson's schema, the 
adolescent's delinquent behavior- in this case, her unwed motherhood- 
reflects her "identity diffusion", or her inability to resolve 
these various identity crises positively.   <The adolescent 
experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs& time diffusion>. 
Time perspective- the ability to plan for the future and 
to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range 
objectives- is more easily developed if, from infancy on, the individual 
has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which 
she lives. Erikson has noted that, unless this trust developed early, 
the time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and temporarily, 
by all adolescents (as a result of their remembering the more immediate 
gratification of wants during childhood, while not yet having fully 
accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood) may develop 
into a more permanent sense of time diffusion. Experience of this time 
diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate 
urgency to act immediately.   These polar extremes in time 
diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported 
in earlier chapters. Some of these mothers, apparently feeling a 
desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the moment, commitments, in love 
and sex, that would have life-long consequences. Others displayed 
utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future. 
For many of these unwed mothers, the data on their family life 
and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources 
of their 
basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in 
general.   However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's 
failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood 
need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of 
identity diffusion in his (or her) adolescence. And, as shown in Chapter 
/6,, some ~SNP females originally developed such trust only 
during their adolescence, through the aid of, and their identification 
with, alter-parents. In the specific case of time diffusion, we 
must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust 
<when it is combined with> the inevitable time crisis experienced by 
most (if not all) adolescents in our society, and with the failure of 
the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.

<The adolescent experiences two closely related crises: self-certainty 
vs& an identity consciousness; and role-experimentation 
vs& negative identity>. A sense of self-certainty and the freedom 
to experiment with different roles, or confidence in one's own unique 
behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity, is more easily 
developed during adolescence if, during early childhood, the individual 
was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some 
autonomy.   However, if the child has been constantly surrounded, 
during nursery and early school age, by peer groups; inculcated 
with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards; and allowed 
little initiative in early play and work patterns- then in adolescence 
her normal degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with 
whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable, will be compounded. 
Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions 
and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence 
are the manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been indoctrinated 
in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt, for failing to behave 
in a manner acceptable to, and judged by, the performance of her nursery- 
and elementary-school peer friends. To be different is to invite 
shame and doubt; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's 
parents, who already consider one different and difficult to understand, 
than by one's peers, who are also experiencing a similar groping 
for and denial of adult status.   The attitudes of some unwed 
mothers quoted in Chapter /2,, revealed both considerable preoccupation 
with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty. 
Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable 
means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others; but 
very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need 
to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and 
with one's self.   <Another identity crisis confronting the 
adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs& work-paralysis>. 
The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise 
the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends 
on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy, initiative, and 
self-discipline during childhood. The developmental process involves 
the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement 
resulting from having completed tasks, having kept commitments, 
and having created something (however small or simple- even a doll 
dress of one's own design rather than in the design "it ought 
to be"). These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty 
that the adolescent needs, for experimenting with many roles, and 
for the <freedom to fail sometimes> in the process of exploring and 
discovering her skills and abilities.   If she has not had such 
experiences, the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will 
be compounded. She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted 
with present and future alternatives- e&g&, whether to prepare 
primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker; whether 
to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself 
while attending school; whether to pursue a college education or a 
job after high school; and whether to attend this or that college and 
to follow this or that course of study. Erikson has noted that, as 
this indecision mounts, it may result in a "paralysis of workmanship". 
This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting- and 
never completing- many jobs, tasks, and courses of study; and in 
the fact that she bases her decisions about work, college, carreer, and 
studies on what others are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity 
with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes. The absence, 
during her childhood and early adolescence, of experiences in developing 
the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability- experiences 
that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement- 
and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy 
and initiative in play and expression, both tend in her adolescence 
to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally 
in experimenting.   The comments made by some unwed mothers 
(quoted in Chapter /2,) reflect this paralysis of workmanship. They 
attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions 
others made; they accepted a job primarily because it was available, 
convenient, and paid reasonably. These things both express and, 
at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity diffusion 
in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and 
self-certainty. As their identity diffusion increased, they became more 
susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs. These 
affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities 
containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship, 
no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.   Childhood 
experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context 
of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance 
for the prevention of illegitimacy. The excerpts from case histories 
presented above confirm this significance, though through different 
facets of experience. For example, some unwed mothers had had no work 
experiences, household chores, and responsibilities during childhood 
and early adolescence; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours 
in searching for something exciting and diverting. Sex was both. On 
the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility 
imposed on them at an early age, and had thus had so little freedom 
or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work 
and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens- to be escaped 
and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden 
sexual behavior.   <The adolescent also faces the identity 
crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs& diffusion 
of ideals>. In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations 
for the prevention of illegitimacy, we shall again superimpose 
Erikson's concept on our data.   Adolescents have a much-discussed 
tendency to polarize ideas and values, to perceive things as 
"either-or", black or white- nuances of meaning are relatively 
unimportant. This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in the 
literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents. Erikson 
has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily 
resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly 
changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood. 
It provides identification- with an idea, a value, a cause that 
cuts through, or even transcends, the multiple and ambivalent identities 
of their passage from child to adult, and permits their forceful 
and overt expression of emotion.   The positive development, during 
adolescence, of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with 
increasing independence, and to identify overtly either with or against 
given ideas, values, and practices, depends to a considerable degree 
on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy, 
initiative, and self-certainty. Most adolescents have some ideological 
diffusion at various developmental stages, as they experience a proliferation 
of ideas and values. The diffusion is most pronounced and 
most likely to become fixed, however, in those who have had no or very 
minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could 
have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources 
of developing self-certainty.   A pronounced ideological 
diffusion- i&e&, inability to <identify independently> with given 
ideas and value systems- is reflected in many ways. For example, 
it is evinced by the adolescent (or adult) whose beliefs and actions 
represent primarily his rebellion and reaction again the ideas and behavior 
patterns of others, rather than his inner conviction and choice. 
It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and 
behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide 
with those of the individual or group present and most important 
at the moment. In another sense, it is represented in the arguments 
of the "true believers" who seek to disprove the validity of all 
other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.

The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological 
diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's inability to <identify 
independently> with a given value system or behavior pattern, and 
her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility 
for her sexual behavior. For example, the unwed mothers expressed 
their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly "what 
it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly". 
They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital 
sexual intercourse. They condemned the movie script writers for implying 
that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating. They criticized parents 
for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong; 
and they censured parents who "never disciplined and were too permissive" 
or who "never explained how easy it was to get pregnant".

In the adult world, there are a number of rather general and 
diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the 
adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis. 
For example, some contemporary writing tends to fuse the "good 
guys" and the "bad guys", to portray the weak people as heroes and 
weakness as a virtue, and to explain (or even justify) asocial behavior 
by attributing it to deterministic psychological, familial, and social 
experiences. 
In the final accounting, these would have augmented the bill for both 
sides. An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.

Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation, 
which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly contributed to constructive 
changes in legal procedure. The duration and other circumstances 
of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of 
patent infringement actions. The suit, as we have seen, came before 
the courts when patent attorneys, inventors, and laymen were making mounting 
demands for reforms in the American patent system. Chief among 
the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures 
in equity.   In a long and angry footnote to his opinion, 
Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism. 
"It is a duty", said Hough, "not to let pass this opportunity 
of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony 
in Equity, current in this circuit (and probably others), excused 
if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court, especially to 
be found in patent causes, and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation. 
As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition, 
rather than <viva voce> before an authoritative judicial officer, 
I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged, and expensive 
prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity". Observing 
that "reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible 
examples", Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing 
procedures. He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case 
record; the duplication of testimony and exhibits; the numerous 
squabbles over minor matters; the "objections stated at outrageous 
length"; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts, "uncalled 
for and 
unjustifiable, from the retort discourteous to the lie direct".

The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was 
"a striking (though not singular) example", concluded Hough, "will 
remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial 
officer present, and responsible for the maintenance of discipline, 
and the reception or exclusion of testimony".   Not least 
among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment 
were those who had participated in the Selden suit. William A& 
Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under 
rules of evidence, the testimony would have been completed in sixty 
days instead of five years. Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for 
reform, inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a "horrible 
example". Its costive deliberations were likened to those of 
the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in 
<Bleak House>.   Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism, 
did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects. But 
he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried. In a detailed 
letter published in the <Scientific American> in 1912, he 
remarked that "loose statements" about the case showed scant understanding 
of the facts. The suit, although commonly designated as a single 
action, actually embraced five cases. Parker insisted that the size 
of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable 
duplication of testimony.   In a private communication written 
in 1911, Parker had been more to the point. Noting the complaints 
of inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted that some 
of the strictures "were fairly well founded", but he added that under 
existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group 
of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent. The 
vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit, as well as the 
complex character of the automotive art, encouraged both sides to exploit 
"every possible chance" for or against the patent, said Parker. 
"This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases, and 
of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the 
record beyond what ordinarily would occur".   Parker listed the 
remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony. 
The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's 
plea for reform. Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate 
or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court 
who had no authority to limit testimony. The taking of depositions, 
he suggested, should be placed under a special court examiner empowered 
to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial 
testimony. "I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power 
existed and this course [been] pursued, it would have shortened 
the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of 
the other witnesses thereto more than that".   In the end Hough's 
acidulous protest, which Parker called the "now somewhat famous 
note on this 'Selden' case", did not go unheeded. In 1912 
the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity 
which became effective on February 1, 1913. The revised procedure 
was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform. Under the new rules, testimony 
is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary 
character. Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent 
prolixity, limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement suits. 
One of the A&L&A&M& lawyers observed that if the Selden 
case had been tried under this simplified procedure, the testimony 
which filled more than a score of volumes, "at a minimum cost of $1 
a page for publication alone, could have been contained in one volume". 
While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive 
forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums 
of money. There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme 
Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit.

Even 
before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the A&L&A&M& 
was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade, the direct lineal 
ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association. 
The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A&L&A&M& 
were more representative, for they never adopted a policy of exclusion. 
Nevertheless, it is from the Selden organization that the industry 
inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests 
of the trade. One of the chief features of this community of interest 
is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone 
in the development of American industrial cooperation. Its origin 
lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath.   From 
the earliest days of the motor car industry, before the A&L&A&M& 
was established, patent infringement loomed as a serious and 
vexing problem. Many patent contests were waged over automobile components 
and accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball bearings, 
license brackets, and electric horns. The fluidity and momentum of 
the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims. As 
early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with 
the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers. 
This scheme failed, and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement 
suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest 
in 1912.   In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing 
scheme adopted by the A&L&A&M& at its founding proved 
to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant 
litigation. The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty 
eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A&L&A&M& 
patent pool (although it did not protect them against outside 
actions) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive 
technology. One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition 
upon the withholding of patent rights among A&L&A&M& members. 
Within its limits, this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics 
of a cross-licensing agreement. Its positive features 
outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly. 
Since the A&L&A&M& holdings embraced only about twenty-five 
per cent of motor vehicle patents, the denial of rights to independent 
companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors 
of the industry. The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding 
gear transmission were held by the A&L&A&M& pool. But Henry 
Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model ~T and earlier 
cars and, in 1905, as a precautionary measure, took out a license 
from the man who claimed to be its inventor.   For those affiliated 
with it, the A&L&A&M& pool was a haven from the infringement 
actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting 
intensity after 1900. By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases, 
many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions. 
It was commonplace for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers 
to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their 
daily mail. "Purely from the business man's standpoint and without 
regard to the lawyer's view", commented a trade journal, "the 
matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing 
some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents 
are to become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple beneficient 
protection devices for encouraging inventive creation".

Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain 
prospect of legal complications. One manufacturer who held an allegedly 
basic patent said: "I would readily put over $50,000 into the 
manufacture of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would enter 
immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would 
eat up all our profits". The prevailing view in the industry was 
summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee: 
"The exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions, 
including delays surrounding legal disputes, particularly in patent 
litigation, are items of industrial burden which must be written 
large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste".

By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping 
constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical 
information. At this point Charles C& Hanch, long an advocate 
of patent peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents committee 
of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, successor 
to the Automobile Board of Trade. Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke 
+ Marmon Company, an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling 
machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904. He had 
first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety 
per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's. 
Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry, 
Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading 
A&L&A&M& members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan. 
The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but Hanch 
did not abandon his scheme.   After the demise of the A&L&A&M&, 
the time was propitious for establishing such a pool. 
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal 
interchange of patents. "It is a much easier course to agree to 
let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned", said 
a trade authority, "than to continue the costly effort of straightening 
the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system, 
which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day".

With the other members of the patents committee- Wilfred C& Leland, 
Howard E& Coffin, Windsor T& White, and W& H& 
Vandervoort- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential 
feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution. The 
plan was supported by Frederick P& Fish, counsel for the National 
Automobile Chamber of Commerce. It will be recalled that in his 
summation for the A&L&A&M& before Judge Hough, Fish had 
condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial 
community. He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used 
their patents solely for nuisance value. "My personal view is that 
not one patented invention in ten is worth making", he later told 
a Congressional committee. The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed 
the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.

Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement became 
effective in 1915. It remained in force for ten years and has been 
renewed at five-year intervals since 1925. 
A little farther along the road you come to the {Church of Santa 
Sabina,} called the "Pearl of the Aventine". Continue another 
hundred yards to the {Piazza of the Knights of Malta.} On the 
wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments. 
The massive {gate} of the Maltese villa affords one of 
the most extraordinary views in Rome. If you look through the keyhole, 
you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome 
of St& Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.

Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via di Santa Sabina and 
turn right on the {Via di S& Alessio,} a street lined with 
stately homes. Oleanders, cypress, and palms in the spacious gardens 
add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section. Turn 
left a block or so before the street ends, and then turn right down 
the Via di Santa Prisca to the {Viale Aventino.} Here you can 
pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city. 

#THE RENAISSANCE CITY#

_TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_ 
These two walks take you through the {heart of Rome.} You will 
walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed in by massive <palazzi>. 
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed, 
a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish 
Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied places, 
both interesting and beautiful, you will become aware of the many 
different civilizations Rome has lived through, and in particular, get 
a feel of Renaissance Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed 
the Eternal City.   Start on the Via d& Teatro di Marcello 
at the foot of the {Capitoline Hill.} The majestic circular 
tiers of stone of the {Theatre of Marcellus} give you some idea 
of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B&C&. 
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days. 
Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled 
his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.   Wander past 
the three superb {Columns of Apollo} by the arches of the theatre. 
The remains of the {Portico of Octavia} are now in front of 
you. Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di 
Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo. 
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli, 
then proceed along the Via dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei. Here 
is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome, the {Fontana delle 
Tartarughe} or {"Fountain of the Tortoises".} It's typical 
of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find 
such an artistic work in the center of a little square. Stand here 
for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths, 
each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head 
of a dolphin. The figures have been executed so skillfully that one 
senses a great feeling of life and movement.   Opposite is the 
{Palazzo Mattei,} one of Rome's oldest palaces, now the headquarters 
of the {Italo-American Association.} Go inside for a closer 
look at a Renaissance palace. In the first courtyard there are 
some fine bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series of delightful 
terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall. The {Palazzo 
Caetani,} still inhabited by the Caetani family, adjoins the Palazzo 
Mattei.   Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross 
the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the {Piazza B& 
Cairoli,} where you should look in at the {Church of San Carlo 
ai Catinari} to see the frescoes on the ceiling. Follow the colorful 
and busy Via d& Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so. Now turn 
left at the Via dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini. 
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro will 
bring you to the {Palazzo Spada,} built in 1540 and now occupied 
by the {Council of State.} Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, 
and Rubens are on display (open 9:30-4:00).   Before you enter 
the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's facade. The great architect 
also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which 
connects the two courts. The large statue on the first floor is believed 
to be the {statue of Pompey} at the base of which Julius Caesar 
was stabbed to death (if so, the statue once stood in the senate 
house). (This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)

By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard Borromini's 
unusual and fascinating trick in perspective. When you stand before 
the barrel-vaulted {colonnade} you have the impression that the statue 
at 
the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few 
feet away. The sense of perspective has been created by designing the 
length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade 
are much shorter than those in front. The gardens of the <palazzo,> 
shaded by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard 
is magnificently decorated.   From the Palazzo Spada you continue 
another block along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti 
to the imposing {Palazzo Farnese,} begun in 1514 and considered 
by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo was the most distinguished 
of several noted architects who helped design it. Today it 
is occupied by the {French Embassy.} Its lovely seventeenth-century 
ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously 
high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays 
(11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris 
and Rome designed by Lurcat.   Directly in front of the palace 
along the Via d& Baullari you will come to the {Campo di Fiori,} 
the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance 
Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit, 
vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the Via d& Baullari to 
the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred 
yards to the {Church of Sant' Andrea della Valle.} As you 
approach the church on the Via d& Baullari you are passing within 
yards of the remains of the {Roman Theatre of Pompey,} near which 
is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated. 
The dome of the church is, outside of {St& Peter's,} 
one of the largest in Rome. Opera lovers will be interested to learn 
that this church was the scene for the first act of <Tosca>.

At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele /2,, 
walk along the Corso del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards, 
then turn left on the Via dei Canestrani to enter the splendid {Piazza 
Navona,} one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.   Your 
first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains, 
its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored 
buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly 
welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have 
followed since starting this walk.   The site of the oblong 
piazza is {Domitian's ancient stadium,} which was probably used 
for horse and chariot races. For centuries it was the location of historic 
festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth to 
the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in 
the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated 
square in their carriages.   Giovanni Bernini's {"Fountain 
of the Rivers",} in the center of the piazza, is built around 
a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes 
and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner, denoting four 
great rivers from different continents- the Danube, the Ganges, the 
Nile, and the Plate. The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, 
perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure 
from her sight the baroque facade of the {Church of Sant' Agnese 
in Agone}, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini. 
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can 
sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch the fountains in the square. The 
scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about 
Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.

Take the Via di S& Agnese in Agone, next to the church 
and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about 
two hundred yards to reach the beautiful {Church of Santa Maria della 
Pace.} Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael 
and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's cloisters 
are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations.   Now 
return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the 
Corsia Agonale; in a moment cross the Corso del Rinascimento. 
In front of you is the {Palazzo Madama,} once belonging to the 
Medici and now the {Italian Senate.} Walk by the side of the 
palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come 
to the {Piazza della Rotonda.} You are now facing the {Pantheon,} 
the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the 
days of ancient Rome.   This circular edifice, constructed by 
Agrippa in B&C& 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor 
Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century. 
As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the 
Temple of Isis, you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian 
columns.   The Pantheon's interior, still in its original 
form, is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its {rotunda} 
forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from 
the floor to the ceiling. The only means of interior light is the 
twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous {dome.} Standing 
before the tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance, when 
shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple, you are 
once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of 
Rome.   As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to 
the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to {Sant' Ignazio,} 
one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city. (Along the way 
there, about one hundred yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant, 
{La Sacrestia,} where you can have the best pizza in Rome.) 
The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church 
seems like a stage set. This is one of the most charming little 
squares in this part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in 
front of the church) will bring you to the {Stock Exchange} in 
the old {Temple of Neptune.} A few yards farther, on the Via 
dei Bergamaschi, is the {Piazza Colonna.} The great column from 
which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius.   You are now at the {Corso,} though narrow, one 
of Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here in the Middle 
Ages.   If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have 
the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso 
for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings- 
mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the 
{Palazzo Doria} (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00-1:00). 
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where 
the family still lives.   Otherwise, cross over the Corso and 
walk a block or so to the left. You will come to {Alemagna,} a 
delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly 
noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries. 
Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the 
place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome. _TO THE SPANISH 
STEPS_ The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken 
after lunch, so that you will reach the {Pincian Hill} when 
the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best. 
Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church 
member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale 
to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality. I myself 
have witnessed and endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers 
also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And this is not, 
perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward 
black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they 
are nearly all downtown.)   It is hard, on the other hand, to blame 
the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably 
innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves. 
He, too, believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended 
when they are not taken for the deed. He has never, himself, done 
anything for which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is 
facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly see him dead, and he 
knows it. There is no way for him not to know it: there are few things 
under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt 
and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore, like 
an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely 
what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes. 
And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company: 
the people who are watching him know why, too. Any street meeting, 
sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as 
its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white 
domination. And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and 
jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination. The white policeman 
standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center 
of the revolution now occurring in the world. He is not prepared 
for it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much more to the 
point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the 
black people around him. Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard 
grain of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid observing 
that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of 
children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children. He 
knows that he certainly does not want <his> children living this 
way. He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into 
a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature. He becomes more 
callous, the population becomes more hostile, the situation grows 
more tense, and the police force is increased. One day, to everyone's 
astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything 
blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials, 
speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding 
to know what happened. What happened is that Negroes want to 
be treated like men.   <Negroes want to be treated like men:> 
a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words. 
People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud, 
and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems 
to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic 
paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on 
the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe to a very well-known 
American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South. 
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me 
in perfect innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South 
move North"? I tried to explain what <has> happened, unfailingly, 
whenever a significant body of Negroes move North. They do not 
escape Jim Crow: they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly 
variety. They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side; 
they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure 
within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion 
is always violent. White people hold the line as long as they can, 
and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical 
violence. But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from 
the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto. The white 
people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make 
a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but 
dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood 
turns into a "turf". This is precisely what happened when the Puerto 
Ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused 
is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.

Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury. They seem 
to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil 
War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going 
on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it; and 
that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what 
is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse. Well, in the 
first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both 
to know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the South and 
white Southerners, because "At least there, you haven't got to 
play any guessing games"! The guessing games referred to have driven 
more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the 
river. I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with 
conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South is the spirit 
of America". He was born in the North and did his military training 
in the South. He did not, as far as I can gather, find the South 
"worse"; he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the 
second place, though, even if Birmingham <is> worse, no doubt 
Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald 
was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history 
of the world. The world has never lacked for horrifying examples; 
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification 
for our own crimes. This perpetual justification empties 
the heart of all human feeling. The emptier our hearts become, the greater 
will be our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly 
backward region, but a part of this country, and what happens 
there concerns every one of us.   As far as the color problem 
is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern 
white and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically and 
in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and 
they loved him. Historically, the flaming sword laid across this Eden 
is the Civil War. Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual 
coming of age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos are set 
up between himself and his past. Everything, thereafter, is permitted 
him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need. The resulting, 
indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the 
basis of the Southern hysteria.   None of this is true for the 
Northerner. Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps, 
the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners 
see them all the time. Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners 
are never really thinking of anything else. Negroes are, 
therefore, ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South, 
and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner nor 
the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man. It seems 
to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be 
considered either as a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many 
Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few, 
comparatively, 
were lynched), or as a victim (in which case we are promised 
that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our 
kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change- 
<cannot> change- until the North changes. The country will 
not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really 
means by freedom. In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness 
is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks 
around us.   It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one 
cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own: 
in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the 
streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become. 

#4. EAST 
RIVER, DOWNTOWN: POSTSCRIPT TO A LETTER FROM HARLEM#
 
 THE 
FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U&N& while Adlai 
Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white 
Americans. Stevenson's speech, and the spectacular disturbance 
in the gallery, were both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the 
day before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the course of 
his address, that the United States was "against" colonialism. God 
knows what the African nations, who hold 25 per cent of the voting 
stock in the U&N& were thinking- they may, for example, have 
been thinking of the U&S& abstention when the vote on Algerian 
freedom was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly accurate 
notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking. I had 
intended to be there myself. It was my first reaction upon hearing 
of Lumumba's death. I was curious about the impact of this political 
assassination on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured 
the popular imagination there. I was curious to know if Lumumba's 
death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events, 
would elicit from "our" side anything more than the usual, well-meaning 
rhetoric. And I was curious about the African reaction.

However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U&N& 
gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the eyes of most Americans, 
would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists. The 
climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of 
the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding 
self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were "Communist" 
inspired. Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent 
Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U&N& rioters 
do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community. 
According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters 
were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted <provocateurs>.

I find this view amazing. It is a view which even 
a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict. One 
has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions. 
The first question is: Would <I> like to live here? 
And the second question is: Why don't those who now live here move 
out? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless 
one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that Negroes 
are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can 
escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is 
not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.   Now, 
I do not doubt that, among the people at the U&N& that day, there 
were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the 
most cynical motives. Wherever there is great social discontent, these 
people are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is not as 
frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity. What 
I find appalling- and really dangerous- is the American assumption 
that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical 
agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest. It is a notion 
which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes 
can make no move unless they are manipulated. 
Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until the early fifties.

Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction 
of the primitive movies of the nineties. Each film consisted of fifty 
feet, which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen. 
As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason 
to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores 
in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can 
still be found in such urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of 
actual events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes. The sensational 
and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at 
the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats. An 
early Edison production was <The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots>. 
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung 
his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An early film by 
a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss 
performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.   In the field 
of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective 
as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over 
before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded, 
one-minute shows. In response, the industry allowed the discovery 
of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies 
the essential form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer 
beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films, and travelogues, 
despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development 
as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the 
play, the novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically 
successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative 
form from the fiction feature. Thus such great American documentaries 
as <The River> and <The Plow That Broke the Plains> 
were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures. 
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early 
years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French 
magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin 
S& Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for 
he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the 
first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion 
picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained 
since, even in the most inept hands. 

#NARRATIVE TIME AND FILM TIME# 

Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician, 
discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain 
part of the vocabulary of film. One of these is the "dissolve", 
which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene. 
As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins 
to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously, 
one growing weaker, one growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales 
and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped 
to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications, 
resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions. Immediately, the 
film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content 
based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time. 
Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected 
one at a time at such a speed that the eye "remembers" the one 
that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing. Linking 
the smoothly changing images together, the eye itself endows them 
with the illusion of movement. The "projection" time of painting 
and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and 
even varying for a given person on different occasions. So is the time 
of the novel. The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall 
both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the 
players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore, 
to much variation, as record collectors well know. The time of the motion 
picture is fixed absolutely. The film consists of a series of still, 
transparent photographs, or "frames", 35-mm&-wide. Each frame 
comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected 
on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second, 
and, for sound films, 24 frames per second. This is the rate of projection; 
it is also the rate of photographing. Time is built into 
the motion picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time is also 
the concern of the fictional narrative, which is, at its simplest, 
the story of an action with, usually, a beginning, a middle, and an end- 
elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence. 
The "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at the 
audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same 
subject, but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic 
element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which 
would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo. In narrative, 
time is essential, as it is in film. Almost everything about the 
movies that is peculiarly <of> the movies derives from a tension created 
and maintained between narrative time and film time. This discovery 
of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling, 
magician's tricks produced on film.   It was Porter, however, 
who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the 
half century of film history that has since ensued. The movie was <The 
Great Train Robbery> and its effects on the young industry and 
art were all but incalculable. Overnight, for one thing, Porter's 
film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten. <The 
Great Train Robbery> is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to 
twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of <Robbery>, 
1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with <Birth of 
a Nation> in 1915. The reel itself became and still is the standard 
of measure for the movies.   The material of the Porter film 
is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the 
years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old West- 
pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's. A 
band of robbers enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the 
telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed 
and pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape, are whooping 
it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers 
run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot 
dead by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the 
band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.

All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did 
two important things that had not been done before. Each scene is shot 
straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed 
in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the 
capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position 
breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which 
had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at 
a play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the 
plane of the film in the camera or on the screen. If the change, at 
first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters 
about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian 
painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of 
geniuses any art has seen. In that apparently simple shift Porter 
opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of 
art as well as a mechanical recording device.   He did more than 
that. He revealed the potential value of the "cut" as the basic 
technique in the art of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically 
in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word is quite 
physical, to begin with. The physical film is cut with a knife at the 
end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically, 
by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence. If, 
as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable footage of your child 
taking its first steps, you have merely recorded an historical event. 
If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends, 
you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's 
grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in 
film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.

This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the looted 
train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's 
little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only 
to find him bound on the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two 
events are taking place at the same time. Time and space have both become 
cinematic. We leap from event to event- including the formation 
of the posse- even though the events, in "reality" are taking 
place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but 
at a considerable distance.   The "chase" as a standard film 
device probably dates from <The Great Train Robbery>, and there 
is a reason for the continued popularity of the device. The chase in 
itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands 
cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage 
of the journey of both. The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another 
is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other 
form of fiction. The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and 
the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not 
only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; 
these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively 
or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative. 

#THE CREATOR OF THE ART OF THE FILM: D&W&GRIFFITH#

There 
still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full 
potential of the new form and to make it an art. The man was D&W& 
Griffith. When he came to the movies- more or less by accident- 
they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking 
for an idle few minutes. In about seven years Griffith either 
invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource 
at the disposal of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith 
had created the art of the film.   Not that there had not been 
attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that. But in general the European 
efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly 
emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly condensed versions 
of famous novels and famous plays were presented. Great actors 
and actresses- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired 
to repeat their stage performances before the camera. In all of this 
extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status 
of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor 
or by the author. The phonograph today, for all its high fidelity 
and stereophonic sound, is precisely what the early art purveyors in 
the movies wished to make of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach 
did not work. The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques 
in the early years of the century and some interesting records 
of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names. But no art 
at all was born of the art effort in the early movies. 
In general, religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis; 
congregational membership, however, is another thing. A congregation 
survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership; 
that is, when it can preserve economic integration. Religious 
faith can be considered a <necessary> condition of membership in 
a congregation, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires 
some motive force, but faith is not a <sufficient> condition for joining; 
the presence of other members of similar social and economic 
level is the <sufficient> condition.   The breakdown of social 
homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account 
for the decline of central city churches. Central cities reveal 
two adverse features for the major denominations: (1) central cities 
tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; (2) central 
cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition. The central 
city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics which 
violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations: 
they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people 
with lower-class residents. Central city areas have become progressively 
poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus 
of middle-class people from most central cities. With few exceptions, 
the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central 
city.   The key to Protestant development, therefore, is economic 
integration of the nucleus of the congregation. Members of higher 
and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus, so that Protestant 
figures on social class give the impression of spread over all 
social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core of membership 
is 
concentrated in a single social and economic stratum. The congregation 
perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the 
neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so high in metropolitan 
areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum 
in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members 
from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits 
for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration. The 
congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is 
secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily 
a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social 
and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism 
(with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do. 
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.

The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences 
has often been attributed to the "folksy spirit" of Protestant 
religious life; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard 
with the "impersonal" Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that 
the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently, the 
vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress 
on personal community in Protestant congregations; actually, there 
is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations, 
as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability of 
Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of 
the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is 
a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore, 
to the principle of economic integration. This fact is evident 
in the recruitment of new members. 

#MISSION AS CO-OPTATION#

The 
rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the 
missionary outreach of the major denominations. There is much talk 
in theological circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's 
Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact that 
the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in 
the world for the healing of the world. A crucial question, therefore, 
is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism. 
If economic integration really shapes congregational life, then 
evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration. 
The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, 
as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar 
social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation. 
(Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to 
fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power 
from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.) In a 
mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of 
recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of 
economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, 
the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation 
rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.

Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been 
carefully studied in the churches; one study in Pittsburgh, however, 
has illuminated the situation. In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh 
churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts 
with friendly members". If we add to these contacts with friendly 
members the "contacts with an organization of the church" (11.2 
per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment 
is through friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound 
approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation show by 
their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people 
respond in kind by joining the church.   Missionary outreach 
by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what 
is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority 
of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic 
position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle 
of informal relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation 
are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths 
of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation; 
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal 
co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people 
who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation. 
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long 
as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people 
who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits 
diminishes, the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no 
longer keep it going.   The transmutation of mission to co-optation 
is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, 
worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members. The 
proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts 
by the clergy (17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts 
by members (over two thirds if organizational activities are included). 
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with 
new members. In general, friendly contact with a member followed by 
contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment 
by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic 
integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission 
in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are 
the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from 
the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will prosper so long 
as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize 
together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability 
of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as 
the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the 
membership. Economic integration ceases when the social and economic 
statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of 
the congregation. In a rapidly changing society congregations will run 
into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration 
are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single 
generation. The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations 
have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred 
years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle 
to maintain economic balance. The expense of this type of organization 
in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which 
deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental 
questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile 
society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations 
illumines the nature of the Protestant development. 
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had 
split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal 
basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends 
seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. Residential 
associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions. 
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential 
communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb, 
Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as 
symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis. 
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved 
with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize 
the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings. 
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the 
drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. This 
conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable 
environment. More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the 
churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan 
life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of 
peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world 
of heterogeneous peoples.   Since American life is committed 
above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the 
countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have 
fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence 
of the metropolis. Consumer communities have suffered at the hands 
of the productive interests. Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural 
newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. Soon they will 
fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches 
will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized 
their history for a century. The identification of the basic unit 
of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a 
residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply 
means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian 
fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. Mission 
to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential 
community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan 
interdependence with residential exclusion.   This interpretation 
of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could 
lead to various projections for the churches. It could be argued 
that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed 
to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the 
middle classes. It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain 
religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities. 
Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational 
and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the 
social identity of middle-class people.   Attention will be given 
in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational 
churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the 
communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes of this style are 
activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. These 
values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating 
the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community 
participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of 
middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major 
denominations. "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly 
contact" form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its contents 
are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued 
by the congregation. What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention 
under the rubric of the organization church. An understanding 
of the new role of residential association in an industrial society 
serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of 
conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.

The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes 
turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs 
and charities should fill the same need. 
With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course 
to pursue.   The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who 
had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company. 
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt 
with the Indians through <engages>, who might be <habitants, voyageurs>, 
or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of 
one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to 
company stores and shipped to France in company ships. The company 
disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.

In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish 
presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians. The lavish 
use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade 
of New France and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change 
in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men. Traders 
from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty 
turned to them. Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded, 
and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian 
insurrections that brought ruin to the company.   In 1721 
the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do 
all that was necessary to protect the colony. They ordered the raising 
of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They 
adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts. 
In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading 
depot to supply the smaller trading houses. For southeastern 
Louisiana, 
Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies 
for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British 
traders. Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending 
northward to the sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse, 
on the Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas 
and Choctaws, but money was available for only one other new 
post, near the present Nashville, Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.

West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi 
district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent upon it 
were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers 
of New Spain.   On the middle Mississippi a principal 
post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped 
that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west, 
principally down the Arkansas River. On the Ohio or Wabash was to 
be built another post "at the fork of two great rivers". Other 
posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication 
with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was 
to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built 
on the Missouri, "where there are mines in abundance". 
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible 
to a director-general at New Orleans. An elaborate system of accounting 
and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the 
most scientific way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision 
of the directors. <Engages> must be loyal to the concessionaires, 
and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended. 
The <habitants> were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose 
of their pelts to the concessionaires.   Only two principal storehouses 
were actually established- one at Mobile, the other at New 
Orleans. New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi, 
and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash. Mobile 
was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district.

The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration 
cannot be determined. Regulations for the Indian trade were 
made by the <Conseil superieure de la Louisiane>, and Bienville 
apparently did not have control of that body. The <Conseil> even 
treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and, 
on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise "suitable 
for the peltry trade". It decided, also, that the purely secular 
efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to 
win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.   During the first 
administration of Bienville, the peltry trade of the Mobile district 
was a lucrative source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually 
15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought 
the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins were the raw material 
for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the 
tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods. 
During his first administration, Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina 
traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country. The 
director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French 
goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian 
needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which 
goods could be moved quickly and cheaply. De la Laude, commander 
of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able 
to make them look upon the British as poor competitors. Diron d'Artaguette, 
the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and 
resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors. 
He became, after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama 
River, but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district, 
and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade.   The 
Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district. 
Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama, 
the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was 
easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees. In 1720 some 
Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them, and did not 
make peace for four years. Venturesome traders, however, continued to 
come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts 
for the French markets. British traders from South Carolina incited 
the Indians against the French, and there developed French and 
British Factions in the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion 
for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana. 
To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they 
controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile. 
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region, 
from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French 
settlements near the Gulf.   Bienville realized that if the French 
were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British 
goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant 
as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices. His urgings brought 
some results. The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply 
of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms 
of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians 
must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation 
into and out of the Indian country.   The insistence of Bienville 
upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive 
back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall 
in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained 
as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance. 
Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, 
and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.

The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina, 
and when Perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special 
instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the 
Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements 
to furnish better goods at attractive prices. To the directors 
the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier 
attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among 
the Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference between 
English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians. They 
were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to 
incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were 
to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant 
supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering. 
Perier's intrigues gained some successes. The savages divided 
into two factions; one was British and the other, French. So hostile 
did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke 
out.   Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective 
in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided 
to send troops into the troubled country. He asked the government 
for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest 
English traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's 
restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory. He asked 
also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' 
pelts.   No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation, 
gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette. 
D'Artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many 
hunters. But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon 
French trade in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one 
last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent 
above the cost in France. The Indians were not impressed and held 
to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the 
Mississippi.   With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended 
all profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted. They destroyed 
a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed French shipping 
on the Mississippi. The war to subdue them taxed the resources 
of the colony and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the company 
asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony. 
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently 
blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered 
to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity. 
The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the 
company at 1,450,000 livres. Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana 
was free to all Frenchmen.   Company rule in Louisiana left the 
colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties 
of trade had ruined many <voyageurs>, and numbers of them 
had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families. Others 
left the country, and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade. 
If this trade should be resumed, the <habitants> who had come 
to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must 
be hardened to the severe life of <coureurs de bois>. This was a 
slow and difficult course, and French trade suffered from the many mistakes 
of the new group of traders. These men were without capital or 
experience.   Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either 
to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown 
furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts 
with pelts. Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected 
that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing 
a trade in which they could see no hope of profits. He reported, too, 
that among the <habitants> there were none of probity and ability 
sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did 
find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers 
to trade. With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all 
the traders.   In order to compete with English traders, Bienville 
radically changed the price schedule. The King should expect 
no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France, 
which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all 
he charged the traders. 
They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned 
a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense. 
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if 
it were the source of such reports. Few things are more perilous for 
the State Department than a displeased congressman.   The reason 
for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends 
so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are 
so available. First, the State Department is unique among government 
agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers may be aroused 
if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget. Businessmen 
will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department. 
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department; the 
Chamber of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope of 
pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly 
toward the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The congressman's 
patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense 
Department. Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every 
voter who can write.   With all these agencies, the congressman 
must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly. 
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon 
the State Department in anger.   In many sections he may even 
reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson. After 
all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer, 
or the businessman, but to <foreigners>. Not only do these foreigners 
not vote for American congressmen; they are also probably 
ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department 
men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders 
who have never met a payroll? Will not the righteous congressman 
be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America 
and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes? 
The chances are excellent that he will.   The result is 
that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is 
the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever 
the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People in this 
position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the 
newspapers. State keeps the junketeering list a secret.   The 
Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion. 
Congress is a harsh master. State is expected to arrange the 
touring Cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected 
to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers 
are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with 
their savings for the children's college tuition.   But come 
the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer 
guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money 
for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for 
its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his 
wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will 
systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance 
for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.

In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during 
the Eisenhower years was Representative John J& Rooney, of 
Brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses. 
Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful 
coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing 
worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of 
techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around- friendly persuasion, 
groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful 
congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic 
corps. Rooney remained untouched.   "The trouble" explained 
Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration, 
"is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing, 
it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we 
do".   One year the Department collected a file of case histories 
to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's 
entertainment bills out of personal income. News of the 
project reached the press. Next day, reports went through the Department 
that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt 
to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances 
and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not 
rise a dollar. They didn't.   The Department's constant 
fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic 
bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional 
power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries 
a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's 
back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.   With 
its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by 
keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it 
did with Dean Acheson. John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his 
personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then 
operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition. During 
Dulles's first two years in office, while Republicans ran the 
Senate, the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for 
its 
blood since 1945.   An internal police operation managed by Scott 
McLeod, a former F&B&I& man installed as security officer 
upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance. So was 
the attack upon Charles E& Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him 
Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler, however, was Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle 
for the Department, Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates. 
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats, 
Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men 
had their way.   In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede 
that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention 
by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him 
and the country's foreign policy. In any event, the example of Acheson's 
trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke 
it. He elected to "get along".   During this dark chapter 
in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas 
later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol 
Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious 
logic of the time, with present treasonous intent. Their successors, 
absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.   This, 
in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats 
took control. In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually 
barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit 
the Russians. For three or four years in the mid-1950's, this 
complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there 
was a dull legislative afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault 
was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by 
anyone but himself.   An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth 
of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying 
anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation. #@ 
GETTING ALONG WITH FOREIGNERS#

THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign 
embassies and legations in Washington. They range from the Soviet 
Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a 
funeral-accessories 
display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called 
"that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street", the modern cement-and-glass 
chancery of the Belgians.   Here is the world of the 
chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers 
and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher, 
and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired 
Lothario.   Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries 
around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions 
on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies. 
Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty, 
the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner. 
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting 
to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington. 
Some, like the British and the French, maintain an elaborate 
system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special 
areas of the American scene. Other embassies cable home <The 
New York Times> without changing a comma.   Each has its peculiar 
style. The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage 
headquarters. When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over 
in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change 
this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a ~TV announcer's 
grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's astonishment he seemed 
no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt 
was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.   Where his predecessors 
had glowered, Menshikov smiled. Where they had affected the 
bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, Menshikov went abroad 
gorgeous in white tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available 
man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the 
vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club 
alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase, it was the most 
unheard-of thing ever heard of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception 
swore that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"? 
And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike". 
"Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave him. His English 
was usable and he used it fearlessly. Toasting in champagne one 
night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and 
gaily cried: "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that 
coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation 
of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts 
complained that the Capitol was out of its wits. Newspaper punditry 
was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to 
smile.   The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians 
usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable 
because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin' 
Mike" dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional 
story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.

The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and the most 
inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians. When King Saud 
visited Washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press 
was the size of his family. Rumor had it that his children numbered 
in the hundreds. The State Department was little help on this, or 
on much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted a Middle 
East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until 
the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a 
brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This 
is where I get my information from", he confided. "But bring it 
right back. It's the only copy I've got".   The size of 
Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his 
first meeting with Eisenhower. When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert 
robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview. 
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American 
friendship to bore in on the central question. How many 
children did the King have?   "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.

And how many of these were sons?   "Twenty-five", 
the sheik replied.   "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter 
asked, "that the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom 
are sons"?   The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is 
precisely correct".   The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness 
of language. When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East 
peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon found himself 
speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo, a language as anarchic 
as Casey Stengel's. The reports of President Nasser's pledges 
which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became 
increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli 
Foreign Minister, Mrs& Golda Meir. Finally he reported that 
Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli 
concessions. 
The deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the 
washing is done outside. I know now why our Japanese friends were 
surprised when they walked into our bathroom.   Of course, most 
toilets are Eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are 
raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets- inside. 
A few newer homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running 
water, they are usually Eastern style.   The next day I visited 
International Christian College which has developed since the war 
under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan 
well. They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching 
and learning. The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical 
stockroom. Spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need 
to be Christian. They have an enviable record of being able to place 
in employment 100% of their graduates.   In the afternoon Miss 
Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs& 
Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs& 
Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful, 
artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household- 
(four boys and four girls), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle Japanese 
woman. She was a real experience! The dances were as beautiful 
as anything I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes 
for scenery and precision as well as imagination.   Because 
Don was leaving the next day, I spent the evening with him at Asia 
Center. The following morning Mr& Morikawa called for me, and 
we went to visit schools- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary 
school, and high school- Mr& Yoshimoto's school. There 
is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some think 
too much.   There is a great deal of thought being given to 
the question of moral education in the schools. With the loss of the 
Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God 
or moral teachings that have strength. The older parents continued 
to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people, 
who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents. There seems 
to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles 
to give stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and freely, 
with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere, especially among 
students. Parents indulge their children.   The government 
has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education 
for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction 
and are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese 
soldiers would not fight again- for why should they? It will be 
painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will 
create or what strong convictions they will develop.   In the evening 
the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the 
New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good. 
They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good, 
except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six of the 
science teachers were present, and we had great fun. 

#KYOTO#

After 
a day at Nikko, Mrs& Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto. 
My instructions were that Mr& Nishimo would meet me at the hotel, 
but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm 
welcome. My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan 
Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen, 
but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did explain to the students, 
however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very 
small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well. They 
understood and teased me a bit about it.   I think I would have 
been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara, 
and Hiroshima. Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its 
cultural center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war- 
and 
is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan. Here 
I was accompanied by Mrs& Okamoto (Fumio's mother), her son, 
Mr& Washizu (a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding 
for more than a year), and Mr& Nishima, one of the science 
teachers. I arrived at 7:00 a&m& and by 9:00 a&m& I had 
finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned. 
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens. We visited the 
Okamoto home- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony. 
At 6:00 p&m& we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place 
where these beautiful dances originated. They were even better than 
those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.   After 
a supper of <unagi> (rice with eel- eel which is raised in an 
ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt& Fuji), I returned to my beautiful 
room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day. 
We started at 9 a&m& to visit the Kyoto University where Mr& 
Washizu is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities 
accompanying the medical school. They apologized for the condition, 
including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what 
to say. There seemed to be no excuse? I don't have the answer 
yet.   We had tea at Mr& Washizu's home where I learned 
that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His grandfather is 
a Buddhist priest; and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest, 
but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become 
the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for only a few 
years ago he would have had no choice. In his big home live four families 
and thirty people, so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed 
here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old- 
paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc&. He had displayed more of them 
than usual so that I could enjoy them. About 100 of the most important 
items he had already given to the museum. The house itself is 400 
years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried times. 

#NARA, 
OSAKA, AND HIROSHIMA#

Mr& Nishima went with me on the train 
to Nara. We passed his house and school on the way. In Nara I 
stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their 
honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid for their coming, but I 
walked on it, too. Here Mr& Yoneda met us after a three-hour train 
trip from the town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles 
in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.

In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles 
to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima. Again the plan was 
for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr& Yoneda 
had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr& Nishima 
and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night. 
It is the second largest city in Japan, with about four million people. 
One spot in Osaka I shall always remember- the bridge where 
we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the 
still waters of the river. In the midst of a great busy city, people 
take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.

My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 
a&m&. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little, 
after which Mr& Uno would arrive and pilot me around. But there 
he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.

I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even 
when I told them I didn't want to. They knew that I was still grieving 
over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the 
recovery 
and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also 
regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better 
a new Japan. There were no words to say this but there was no need.

The teachers of Mr& Uno's school gave me a small gift 
to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better city than it was before- 
in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace 
and understanding. I was grateful for their insight into my need 
for this experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima. 

#TOKYO#

On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took 
us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University. 
This day was "Open House for Parents" day, and the girls were 
busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables. Everything was in 
an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.   It was 
thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese 
students in a class in Home Planning. Our Masu is one of the very 
few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family 
functions and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come when 
women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now 
it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants. Many 
of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American 
homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese 
artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the 
Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.   At this Women's 
University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed 
that Japanese women also should be educated. Even today there are 
some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this 
University continues to grow and to send its students out into the 
community. Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus 
where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they 
can have their social gatherings and professional meetings. As far 
as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the 
creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found 
by educated women unafraid to break traditions.   Masu is also 
teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo. 
Here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled 
in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They learn how 
to take care of children and sick members of the family. They have model 
kitchens, a sick room with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with 
a life-like doll. Although the training is only for one month, it 
is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's school are much 
in demand and can always find work immediately. Occasionally they return 
for additional training. Masu's home economics training comes 
into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for 
the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also uses the training she got 
in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, 
and work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education in 
the United States, not just in a classroom, but also in an American 
house with an American housekeeper, stands her in good stead. 

#UNIVERSITY 
OF TOKYO#

After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen 
of which Masu had planned, Mr& Washizu and I left to meet representatives 
of the ~USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo. 
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could 
not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous 
in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant. 
The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only 
by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following 
consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads 
of certain national chain stores should, of course, be applauded. But 
for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of 
a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts 
contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions 
in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing 
a connection between general company practice and local practice 
in the South, and by establishing such direct connection between the 
practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York 
and general company policy. Then the boycott would not be secondary, 
but a primary one. It would be directed against the actual location of 
the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice, 
must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury 
of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy. Perhaps 
this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire 
national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire 
economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores 
in the matter of segregation. Such a general boycott might still be a 
blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable 
justification. 
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove 
most decisive and is most clearly legitimate. Moreover, prudence alone 
would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to 
fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon 
national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage 
to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to 
greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even 
(as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure 
to correct injustice) to its going out of business in certain sections 
of the country (as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many 
meetings in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business 
in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover 
a large number of southern adherents).   In any case, anyone who 
fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary 
applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified 
that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years 
ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils 
in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer 
in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a 
national ~TV network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed, 
a "high yellow gal" smooching with a white man. It is true, 
of course, that the end or objective of this action was different. But 
since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals 
and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where 
direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the 
matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not 
effectively present, there has to be a <morality of means> applied in 
every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures 
or other forms of force.   the need that we not give unqualified 
approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed 
against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the 
fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation 
mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical 
violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically 
opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow 
humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously 
brutal means. The end or aim of the action, of course, is also 
important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community 
customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person 
from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e&g&, against 
Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the 
present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance 
to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies. This, however, 
is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and 
economic conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war of all 
against all no less than if other means are used. It is also sufficient 
to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs 
to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his <conduct> 
is just, i&e&, that, if economic pressure has to be resorted 
to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the 
way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while, 
if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily 
(however inevitably) and not by deliberate intent and direct 
action against them.   It is clear that non-violent resistance is 
a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian 
morality, like any other form of resistance. The <language> used 
itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle 
for victory (perhaps to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in 
leaders has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom 
of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in the world today 
might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom 
is going to march over them". The present writer certainly agrees 
with that statement, and would also affirm this- in the order of justice. 
However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity 
interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches 
forward. And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice 
and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental 
good will. It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained 
above, and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent 
means. 
R& B& Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will of 
the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical 
jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance. He 
suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent 
resistance of most victims would render him"; and again, that 
"the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object 
of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will, 
to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope. In another respect 
it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent 
only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is 
based on sounder values".   A trial of strength, however, is made 
quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent 
resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder 
values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means, 
men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause. This makes necessary 
a morality of means, and principles governing the <conduct> of 
resistance whenever this is thought to be justified. The question, 
then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent 
means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes 
and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing 
him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some 
causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem 
insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently. 
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into 
the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem 
the more unlimited aggression.   Among Christian groups, the 
Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that 
the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the 
Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the will and word of God 
are for them concentrated in Christlike love, it seems clear to them 
that non-violent resistance is quite another thing. "The primary 
objective of non-violence", writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, 
"is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain 
desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage". 
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must 
certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any 
form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and 
affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine 
the moral principles limiting resistance. These principles we 
have now set forth. <Economy> in the use of power needs not only to 
be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is done it will 
be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across 
the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to 
both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action. 
Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a 
<barely 
intolerable> pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed. 
That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly 
in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals. There 
must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use 
of means of resistance, violent or non-violent. The justification 
in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays 
down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against 
whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted 
also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the 
sake even of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic 
withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading 
in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these 
distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be 
singled out.   We may now take up for consideration a hard case 
which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure 
or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above. 
There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken 
at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination 
against a whole people. An excellent article was published recently in 
the journal of the Church Peace Union by a South African journalist 
on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa, 
amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic <complicity> of both 
the government and the people of the United States in these conditions. 
"**h Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors 
but also from the pockets of U& S& taxpayers", this author 
states, "are being poured into South Africa to support a system 
dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical 
exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens 
not to be white". Both the conditions and the complicity are documented 
in considerable detail. This leads to the conclusion that "the 
fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not 
<apartheid> shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic 
boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with 
the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as 
a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our 
own country, but also in accord with our law, U&S& Code Title 
19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced 
or convict labor. Not only should this provision be enforced but 
other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author 
believes, "must surely be supported by every American who values the 
freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated 
by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly 
contribute to the enslavement of another nation".

NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights 
and of integration. They have also led the nation in the direction 
of a welfare state. And both in their objectives of non-discrimination 
and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners 
who are called Bourbons. The name presumably derives from the 
French royal house which never learned and never forgot; since Bourbon 
whiskey, though of Kentucky origin, is at least as much favored 
by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South.   The 
nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little 
understood in the North. The race problem has tended to obscure other, 
less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive. 
It is these other differences between North and South- other, 
that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare- 
which I chiefly discuss herein.   I write about Northern liberals 
from considerable personal experience. A Southerner married to 
a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting 
town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men, 
and business executives of egghead tastes. Most of them are Democrats 
and nearly all consider themselves, and are viewed as, liberals. This 
is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of 
liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center 
are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that 
the best government was the least government. Yet paradoxically my 
liberal 
friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints. 
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and 
democracy, I find that they fall into two categories: the simpler 
ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without 
analysis; and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that 
these things don't count any more in the world of to-day. I am naive, 
they say, to make use of such words.   I take this to mean 
that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical?- liberal 
considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will 
assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual 
and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield 
before it. This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian 
bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try 
to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court. As for states' 
rights, they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends 
except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist 
now only as anachronisms.   The American liberal may, in the world 
of to-day, have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed 
in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one. Why, in the first place, 
call himself a liberal if he is against <laissez-faire> and favors 
an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over 
everybody? If he attaches little importance to personal liberty, 
why not make this known to the world? And if he is so scornful of 
the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution 
that he could more sincerely support?   I am concerned here, 
however, with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South. It 
appears to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort 
to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends. His assumption 
seems to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more 
liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy 
with his views. <Time's> editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, 
<The Waist-High Culture>, wrote: "**h most of what was 
different about it (the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to 
**h". This, for the liberals I know, would be an understatement. 
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate 
hatred that was directed against Fascism.   I do not think 
that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the 
North. In business circles, usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere 
would hardly be found. But in our case- and neither my wife nor 
I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional 
outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and 
come close to wrecking several more. In fact it has caused us to give 
serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy 
for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host 
is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners 
who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards 
down.   Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in 
the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state-supported 
universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority 
view. But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected 
to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in 
social gatherings. From my wife's experience and other sources, this 
seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles. The strong feeling 
is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among 
college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who 
studied in the North. And social relations arising out of business 
ties impose courtesy, if not sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners. 
Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the 
prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.   There 
are of course many Souths; but for this discussion the most important 
division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who 
haven't. My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed 
rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War. Nobody 
knows how many Southerners there are in this category. I suspect 
that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to 
believe. I never heard of a poll being taken on the question. No doubt 
such a thing would be considered unpatriotic. Prior to 1954 I imagine 
that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy. 
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is 
more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following 
the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would 
have been for the Old South.   Belief in the traditional way of 
life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones. Probably 
a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain 
unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia, North Carolina, and 
Alabama following along after them. Old attitudes are held more tenaciously 
in the Tidewater than the Piedmont; so that a line running 
down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater 
would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course, 
important minority enclaves.   The long-settled areas of states 
like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture 
to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and 
the consciousness of loss the greater. Also, we should not even to-day 
discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering 
on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies 
than with the North even after independence. The social and psychological 
consequences of this continue to affect the area. In certain 
respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South. 
Poor where they had once been rich, humbled where they had been 
arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the 
nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from 
the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country. And 
no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia, which 
were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century, bitterly 
regretted the revolt against the Crown.   Among Bourbons 
the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed 
than other factors. All Southerners agree that slavery had to 
go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling 
it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did. Southern 
resentment has been over the method of its ending, the invasion, 
and Reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro 
political control in many counties. But apart from racial problems, 
the old unreconstructed South- to use the moderate words favored by 
Mr& Thomas Griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what 
is different about the civilization of the North. And this, in effect, 
means most of modern America.   It is hard to see how the 
situation could be otherwise. And therein, I feel, many Northerners 
delude themselves about the South. For one thing, this is not a subject 
often discussed or analyzed. There seems to be almost a conspiracy 
of silence veiling it. I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful 
thinking: don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and 
they will take care of themselves. Or else the North really believes 
that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come 
around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers 
of the American Dream, like everybody else.   If the circumstances 
are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be 
true. The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western 
world. Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area 
appropriate to a pre-World-War-/1, great power have been, following 
conquest, 
ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had 
imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike. And the 
great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent. 
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic 
origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign 
domination. The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot 
and cold. In every war of the United States since the Civil War 
the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country. So instead 
of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the 
two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances 
and cement reunion. And there is no section of the nation more 
ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism. Had the 
situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 
1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is 
little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put 
on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain. It 
is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners 
should have been as docile as they have. The North should thank its 
stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not 
draw false inferences therefrom.   The two main charges levelled 
against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social 
reactionaries. There is much truth in both these charges, and not 
many Bourbons deny them. Whatever their faults, they are not hypocrites. 
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best 
race in the world and that it should remain pure. Many Northeners 
believe this, too, but few of them will say so publicly. The Bourbon 
economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern 
conservatives. But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed 
go much further than this. They believe that if the South 
had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that 
of modern America. As it is, they consider that the North is now 
reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high 
standard of living the "American way" has been proved inferior 
to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the 
socialistic features of the latter.   The South's antipathy 
to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh 
accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy 
and the use of leisure. Their own easier, slower tempo is especially 
dear to Southerners; and I have heard many say that they are content 
to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because 
they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.

In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry Maine noted 
long ago, were only two in number: internal order and external security. 
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men, 
the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order 
within its territorial borders. Outside those limits it asserted, as 
against other states, a position of sovereign equality, and, as against 
the "inferior" peoples of the non-Western world, a position of 
dominance. It became the sole "subject" of "international law" 
(a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham), 
a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western 
nations could do in the world arena. (That corpus of law was a 
reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. Speaking generally, it furthered- and still 
tends to further- the interests of the Western powers. The enormous 
changes in world politics have, however, thrown it into confusion, so 
much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in 
need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions 
of the present era.)   Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned 
above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state 
responsibility, either internally or externally. This was particularly 
true in the world arena, which was an anarchical battleground characterized 
by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires. 
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have 
astonished a nineteenth-century statesman. His duty was to his sovereign 
and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial 
boundaries was not to be contemplated. Thus, to cite but one 
example, the <Pax Britannica> of the nineteenth century, whether with 
the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling 
world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other 
nations (e&g&, the United States) may have incidentally benefited. 
At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal 
responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial 
state was strongly resisted. Social Darwinism was able to stave 
off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.

However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are multiple 
reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has 
occurred in both facets of national activity. A concept of responsibility 
is in process of articulation and establishment. Already firmly 
implanted internally, it is a growing factor in external matters. 
##

A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned 
an important corner. In what has aptly been called a "constitutional 
revolution", the basic nature of government was transformed from 
one essentially negative in nature (the "night-watchman state") to 
one with affirmative duties to perform. The "positive state" came 
into existence. For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences, 
there has been a special fascination since then in the role 
played by the Supreme Court in that transformation- the manner in 
which its decisions altered in "the switch in time that saved nine", 
President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious "Court-packing 
plan", the imprimatur of judicial approval that was 
finally placed upon social legislation. Of greater importance, however, 
is the content of those programs, which have had and are having enormous 
consequences for the American people. Labor relations have been 
transformed, income security has become a standardized feature of political 
platforms, and all the many facets of the American version of 
the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom. A national 
consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts 
are desirable as well as necessary. Ratified in the Republican Party 
victory in 1952, the Positive State is now evidenced by political 
campaigns being waged not on <whether> but on <how much> social 
legislation there should be.   The general acceptance of the idea 
of governmental (i&e&, societal) responsibility for the economic 
well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant 
watersheds in American constitutional history. The other, of 
course, was the Civil War, the conflict which a century ago insured 
national unity over fragmentation. A third, one of at least equal and 
perhaps even greater importance, is now being traversed: American 
immersion and involvement in world affairs.   Internal national 
responsibility, now a truism, need not be documented. Nevertheless, 
it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for, as 
will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept. Thirty 
years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression, 
the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow 
"natural forces" to operate and cure the distress. That guiding 
principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the 
New Deal; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the 
Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the 
responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment. 
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through 
planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution. In 
1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration 
came when the principle of <national> responsibility for <local> 
economic distress won out over a "state's-responsibility" 
proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief 
by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted 
with manpower surplus. The American people have indeed come 
a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.   Internal 
national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the 
Industrial Revolution. Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption 
of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals 
to cope with the rigors of the era. National responsibility for 
individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or 
even to the Western nations. A measure of its widespread acceptance 
may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists 
in 1959. Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International 
Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world, 
the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law 
to include affirmative governmental duties. It is noteworthy that 
the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed, 
former colonial nations. The Rule of Law, historically a principle 
according everyone his "day in court" before an impartial tribunal, 
was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of 
government to promote individual welfare. Recognizing that the Rule 
of Law is "a dynamic concept **h which should be employed not only 
to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free 
society", the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility 
"to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions 
under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized". 
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common 
feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world. For better or for worse, 
we all now live in welfare states, the organizing principle of which 
is collective responsibility for individual well-being.   Whether 
a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility 
operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more 
difficult to establish. The hypothesis ventured here is that it does, 
and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition. The content 
is not the same, however: rather than individual security, it 
is the security and continuing existence of an "ideological group"- 
those in the "free world"- that is basic. External national 
responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of 
the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability 
of other friendly nations. If internal responsibility suggests acceptance 
of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility 
implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.

Reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty- 
may help to reveal the contours of the new principle. In its beginnings 
the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally, 
against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence 
of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church. The breakup of 
the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more 
than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism. (Since the time-span 
of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence 
of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural 
for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest 
form of order, something permanent and unchanging.) The concept of 
nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies 
the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure. But 
it is more than that. For it includes the emotional ties that bind 
men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large 
group of people together as a unit. Today, as new nations rise from 
the former colonial empires, nationalism is one of the hurricane forces 
loose in the world. Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has 
become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that 
nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm. Historically, however, 
the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the 
Western civilizational group. By subduing disparate lesser groups 
the nation has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual 
liberty. Within their confines, moreover, technological and 
industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing 
the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied. While the 
pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism 
has in fact served the Western peoples well. (Whether historical nationalism 
helped the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether 
today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial 
aspects, are other questions.)   It is one of the ironic quirks 
of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the 
territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that 
the nation-state attained its highest number (approximately 100). But 
it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is 
no longer a tenable concept is <because> it has spread throughout the 
planet. In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had 
limited application, both as to geography and as to population; it 
becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.

Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal 
principle of sovereignty. The former receives its legitimacy from the 
latter. Operating side by side, together they helped shore up the nation-state. 
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present 
usage it is essentially modern. Jean Bodin, writing in the sixteenth 
century, may have been the seminal thinker, but it was the vastly influential 
John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now 
understood. Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty 
still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking. To 
him, law is the command of the sovereign (the English monarch) who 
personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to 
make law- i&e&, to prevail over internal groups and to be free 
from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations. These fundamental 
ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual (internal-external) 
aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate 
political power.   The nation-state, then, exemplifies the principle 
of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over 
domestic affairs and independence from outside control. In fact, however, 
both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined. High-level 
abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision. 
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic 
societies, in which "popular" sovereignty is said to exist, 
and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split. Nevertheless, 
nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted 
wisdom, to describe the modern world. Is there a different reality behind 
the facade? Does the surface hide a quite different picture?

The short answer to those questions is "yes". Both concepts 
are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted 
by a concept of national responsibility. As evidence to support 
that view, consider the following illustrative instances. 
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident? What steps have been 
taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the 
destruction of continents? Are we as safe as we should be from such 
a disaster? Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety? 
Will the danger increase or decrease?   I have just asked 
these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of 
key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl 
for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain 
Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as "Sherwood 
Forest". I asked the same questions inside the launch-control 
rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear 
sidearms are manning the "commit buttons" that could start a war- 
accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other 
pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.   To 
the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments 
and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of 
tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched. 
There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate. 
"Readiness exercises" are almost continuous. Each could be the real 
thing.   In the command centers there are special clocks ready 
to tick off the minutes elapsed since "~E hour". "~E" 
stands for "execution"- the moment a "go order" would unleash 
an American nuclear strike. There is little time for the men in the 
command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks. 
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing 
colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business 
machines. They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical 
details. Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people 
who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so 
they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.   Among 
the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others 
charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their 
"hardware", the answers to my questions varied partly according to 
a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call "scenarios". 
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it: "You can't have 
dry runs on this one". The experts are thus forced to hypothesize 
sequences of events that have never occurred, probably never will- 
but possibly might. Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with 
these men: The more highly placed they are- that is, the more they 
know- the more concerned they have become.   Already accidental 
war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration 
about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions 
of national security. Only recently new "holes" were 
discovered in our safety measures, and a search is now on for more. Work 
is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed 
on all nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, the experts speak of 
wars triggered by "false pre-emption", "escalation", "unauthorized 
behavior" and other terms that will be discussed in this report. 
They inhabit a secret world centered on "go codes" and "gold 
phones". Their conversations were, almost invariably, accompanied 
by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward 
each other in arclike semicircular motions. One arm represented our bombers 
and missiles, the other arm "theirs". Yet implicit in each 
movement was the death of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, perhaps 
you and me- and the experts.   These men are not callous. 
It is their job to think about the unthinkable. Unanimously they believe 
that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more 
Russians and Communist Chinese, too- thought about accidental 
war.   The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box 
within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle, a 
frail, meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist. He was, and is, with the 
~RAND Corporation, a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the 
U& S& Air Force. His investigations made him the Paul Revere 
of accidental war, and safety procedures were enormously increased.

In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal 
by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy 
has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war 
danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.   The 
chain starts at ~BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning 
System) in Thule, Greenland. Its radar screens would register Soviet 
missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States. 
~BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to ~NORAD 
(North American Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado, for interpretation; to the ~SAC command and control 
post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near 
Omaha, Nebraska; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.   Telephones, 
Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems and, in some cases, television, 
link all vital points. Alternate locations exist for all key command 
centers. For last-ditch emergencies ~SAC has alternate command 
posts on ~KC-135 jet tankers. Multiple circuits, routings and 
frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.   The 
same principle of "redundancy" applies to all communications on these 
special networks. And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits 
until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special 
codes, 
that the messages actually come from their purported sources. Additional 
codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.

Only the President is permitted to authorize the 
use of nuclear weapons. That's the law. But what if somebody decides 
to break it? The President cannot personally remove the safety 
devices from every nuclear trigger. He makes the momentous decision. 
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers 
and to push the buttons. What if one or more of them turn irrational 
or suddenly, coolly, decide to clobber the Russians? What if the President 
himself, in the language of the military, "goes ape"? 
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets 
without provocation?   Nobody can be absolutely certain of 
the answers. However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully, 
so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.   Even 
the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a "go" order. 
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the 
"go code". In an emergency he would receive available intelligence 
on the "gold-phone circuit". A system of "gold"- actually 
yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of 
the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the ~SAC 
commander and other key men. All can be connected with the gold circuit 
from their homes. All could help the President make his decision. 
The talk would not be in code, but neither would it ramble. Vital 
questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda. 
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured 
me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the 
gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from ~BMEWS.

If communications work, his decision would be instantly known 
in all command posts that would originate the actual go order. For 
these centers, too, are on the gold circuit. They include the Navy's 
Atlantic Command at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with 
the Polaris subs; ~NATO headquarters in Europe; Air Force 
forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific, which control 
tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and ~SAC, which controls 
long-range bombers and Atlas missiles.   Let us look in on 
one of these nerve centers- ~SAC at Omaha- and see what must 
still happen before a wing of ~B-52 bombers could drop their ~H-bombs.

In a word, plenty. The key man almost certainly would 
be Col& William W& Wisman, ~SAC's senior controller. He 
or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, all full colonels, 
mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day. It is a quiet 
but impressive room- 140 feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, twenty-one 
feet high. Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts 
are crammed with intelligence information. And Bill Wisman, forty-three, 
a farmer's son from Beallsville, Ohio, is a quiet but impressive 
man. His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown. His movements 
and speech are precise, clear and quick. No question ruffles him 
or causes him to hesitate.   Wisman, who has had the chief controller's 
job for four years, calls the signals for a team operating 
three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights, switches and buttons. 
At least a dozen men, some armed, are never far away from him. 
In front of him is a gold phone. In emergencies the ~SAC commander, 
Gen& Thomas Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy 
a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman 
and his staff. At General Power's seat in the balcony there is 
also a gold phone. General Power would participate in the decision 
making. Wisman, below, would listen in and act. His consoles can give 
him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and 
with every ~SAC aircraft.   He need only pick up one of 
the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the 
big red button marked ALERT. (There are two receivers in case 
one should be dropped and damaged.)   But Wisman, too, does not 
know the go code. He must take it from "the red box". In point 
of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half 
feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to 
Wisman's right. The box is internally wired so the door can never 
be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ("It's real obnoxious").

Now we must become vague, for we are approaching 
one of the nation's most guarded secrets. The codes in the red box- 
there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained 
in a sealed ~X-ray-proof "unique device". They are supplied, 
a batch at a time, by a secret source and are continually changed 
by Wisman or his staff, at random intervals.   But even the contents 
of Wisman's box cannot start a war. They are mere fragments, 
just one portion of preprepared messages. What these fragments are 
and how they activate the go order may not be revealed. The pieces must 
be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff. 
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures 
which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special 
codes, each message also contains an "internal authenticator", 
another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting 
the real thing.   I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke 
out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one. "I'd wind 
up full of .38 bullet holes", he said, and there was no question that 
he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.   Now let 
us imagine a wing of ~B-52's, on alert near their "positive control 
(or fail-safe) points", the spots on the map, many miles from 
Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific 
orders to proceed to their targets. They, too, have fragments of 
the go code with them. As Wisman put it, "They have separate pieces 
of the pie, and we have the whole pie. Once we send out the whole 
pie, they can put their pieces into it. Unless we send out the whole 
pie, their pieces mean nothing". Why does Wisman's ever-changing 
code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers? 
The answer is a cryptographic secret. At any rate, three 
men out of a six-man ~B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's 
go-to-war message. Each must match Wisman's "pie" with the 
fragment that he carries with him. All three must compare notes and agree 
to "go". ##

After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated 
work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum 
of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each 
with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released. 
Unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals 
from the handles removed first- no damage can be done.

Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the game ended. They 
went as rigid as black statuary **h six figures, lean and tall and 
angular, went still. Their heads were in the air sniffing. They all 
swung at the same instant in the same direction. They saw it before 
I did, even with my binoculars. It was nothing more than a tiny distant 
rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds 
to the earth. In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree, 
no more. A white man would not have seen it. The aborigines fastened 
upon it with a concentration beyond pathos. Watching, they waited 
until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant 
across the dry burning land. At once the whole band set off at a lope. 
They were chasing a rain cloud.   They went after the squall 
as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow. I followed them 
in the jeep and now they did not care. The games were over, this 
was life. Occasionally, for no reason that I could see, they would suddenly 
alter the angle of their trot. Sometimes I guessed it was because 
the rain squall had changed direction. Sometimes it was to skirt 
a gulley. Their gait is impossible to convey in words. It has nothing 
of the proud stride of the trained runner about it, it is not a lope, 
it is not done with style or verve. It is the gait of the human who 
must run to live: arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground, 
head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target, 
a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully 
graceful. It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.

They ran for three hours. Finally, avoiding hummocks and seeking low 
ground, they intercepted the rain squall. For ten minutes they ran 
beneath the squall, raising their arms and, for the first time, shouting 
and capering. Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady. 
They were studying the ground. Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a 
few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground. He had found 
a depression with rain water in it. He bent down, a black cranelike figure, 
and put his mouth to the ground.   With a lordly and generous 
gesture, 
the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows. The 
other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle. In an instant 
he had sucked it dry.   The aborigine lives on the cruelest land 
I have ever seen. Which does not mean that it is ugly. Part of it 
is, of course. There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which 
are hideous. They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so 
many centuries that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges 
fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty 
feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand. 
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality. But much of the land 
which the aborigine wanders <looks> as if it should be hospitable. 
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has a peaceful quality, 
the hills roll softly.   The malignancy of such a landscape 
has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean. He 
tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock, 
a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer. They went well-equipped 
with everything except knowledge of the "outback" country. "

The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle 
slopes and soft gray tree-clumps. Nothing appalling or horrible rushed 
upon these men. Only there happened- nothing. There might have 
been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only- 
there was not. It might have rained, any time; only- it did not. 
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise; 
only- there was not. They lay, with the birds hopping from branch 
to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them. No one 
came".   The white men died. And countless others like them have 
died. Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of 
men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly 
lost direction, were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant 
and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally died.

The aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard 
and pitiless. He knows that the economy of life in the "outback" 
is awful. There is no room for error or waste. Any organism that falters 
or misperceives the signals or weakens is done. I do not know 
if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge, but 
I suspect that it can. Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his 
odd air of dignity. 

#THE FAMILY AT THE BOULDER#

SEEING an aborigine 
today is a difficult thing. Many of them have drifted into the 
cities and towns and seaports. Others are confined to vast reservations, 
and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish 
them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they 
are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for <corroborees> 
at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch- 
which is very low indeed.   I persuaded an Australian friend 
who had lived "outback" for years to take me to see some aborigines 
living in the bush. It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation, 
even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge 
of the aborigines and their language. Finally, however, the arrangements 
were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover. We 
followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a 
smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth. 
The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big 
red boulder, swung off the road. At once he started to glance toward 
the instrument panel. It took me a moment to realize what was odd 
about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked 
gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about. The rancher
