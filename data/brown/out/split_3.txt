was navigating his way across the flatland.   "Do you always 
navigate like this"? I asked.   "Damned right", he 
said. "Once I get out on the flat I do. Some chaps that know an 
area well can make their way by landmarks **h a tree here, a wash here, 
a boulder there. But if you don't know the place like the palm of 
your hand, you'd better use a compass and the speedometer. Two miles 
northeast, then five miles southwest **h that sort of thing. Very 
simple".   He was right. The landscape kept repeating itself. 
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was 
hopeless. Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines. They 
were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man, his lubra, 
and two children. The sun was not yet high and all of them were in 
the small area 
of shade cast by the boulder.   There was also a dog, 
a dingo dog. Its ribs showed, it was a yellow nondescript color, 
it suffered from a variety of sores, hair had scabbed off its body in 
patches. It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving, 
watching us carefully. It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished 
dog. No one patted the dog. It was not a pet. It was a worker.

"The buggers love shade", the rancher said. "I suppose 
because it saves them some loss of body water. They'll move around 
that rock all day, following the shade. During the hottest part of 
the day, of course, the sun comes straight down and there isn't any 
shade".   We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land Rover, 
and walked over toward the family.   The man was leaning against 
the rock. He gazed away from us as we approached. He was over 
six feet tall and very thin. His legs were narrow and very long. Every 
bone and muscle in his body showed, but he did not give the appearance 
of starving. He had long black hair and a wispy beard. The ridges 
over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut. There was something 
about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds 
to realize what. It was not merely that flies were crawling over his 
face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into 
his eye sockets. A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into 
the socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and across the wet 
surface of the eyeball, and the eye did not blink. The Australian 
and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered 
by insects, but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.

I turned to look at the lubra. She remained squatting on her heels 
all the time we were there; like the man, she was entirely naked. 
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family 
possessions which were placed in front of her. There were two rubbing 
sticks for making fire, two stones shaped roughly like knives, a woven-root 
container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead 
body of some rodent. There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera, 
a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity 
and high accuracy. There was also a boomerang, elaborately carved. Everything 
was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects 
seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.

The two children, both boys, wandered around the Australian 
and me for a few moments and then returned to their work. They squatted 
on their heels with their heads bent far forward, their eyes only 
a few inches from the ground. They had located the runway of a colony 
of ants and as the ants came out of the ground, the boys picked them 
up, one at a time, and pinched them dead. The tiny bodies, dropped onto 
a dry leaf, made a pile as big as a small apple.   The odor 
here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines. 
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant. It was also 
subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied 
innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed. 
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant. 
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one. The smell is sexual, but 
so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.   Their 
skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost 
the consistency of a second skin. They roll at night in ashes to keep 
warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it. In spots 
such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized 
the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating 
of sweat, dirt, and ashes were a cosmetic. The boys had beautiful 
dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies 
and blinked their eyes.   "That smell is something, eh, mate"? 
the Australian asked. "They swear that every person smells 
different and every family smells different from every other. At the 
<corroborees,> when they get to dancing and sweating, you'll see 
them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good 
smell. Idje, here", and he nodded at the man, "is said to have 
great odor. The stink is all the same to me, but I really think they 
can make one another out blindfolded".   "Here, Idje, you 
fella like tabac"? he said sharply. Idje still stared over our shoulders 
at the horizon. The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin 
I could understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.

It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the seventeenth 
century was a great period in Persian art. The architects, the tile 
and carpet makers, the potters, painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths 
worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich 
the city. Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by 
what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales 
and roses, cut by canals and terraced promenades, studded with 
water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening 
blue curves of a hundred domes. At the heart of all of this was the square, 
which one such traveler declared to be "as spacious, as pleasant 
and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe". In time Isfahan 
came to be known as "half the world", Isfahan <nisf-i-jahan>.

In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city, then the 
size of London, started to decline. The Afghans invaded; the Safavids 
fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached. 
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place, and now it is 
for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of 
old Persia and sometimes of the East. They think of it as a kind of 
spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.

Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky 
at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight. But even for them it 
remains a museum, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb, 
a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead. Everyone 
is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost no one is 
willing to acknowledge their present. It seems that for Persia, and 
especially for this city, there are only two times: the glorious past 
and the corrupt, depressing, sterile present. The one apparent connection 
between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other 
have survived and which naturally enough are called "historical monuments".

However, just as all the buildings have not fallen and 
flowed back to their original mud, so the values which wanted them 
and saw that they were built have not all disappeared. The values and 
talents which made the tile and the dome, the rug, the poem and the miniature, 
continue in certain social institutions which rise above the 
ordinary life of this city, as the great buildings rise above blank walls 
and dirty lanes. Often, too, the social institutions are housed 
in these pavilions and palaces and bridges, for these great structures 
are not simply "historical monuments"; they are the places where 
Persians live.   The promenade, for example, continues to take 
place on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees 
that now serves as the city's principal street. ?t takes place 
as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge, 
and also in the gardens of the square. On Fridays, the day when 
many Persians relax with poetry, talk, and a samovar, people do not, 
it is true, stream into Chehel Sotun- a pavilion and garden built 
by Shah Abbas /2, in the seventeenth century- but they do retire 
into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley, 
which are smaller, more humble copies of the former. And of course 
religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques, and commercial 
life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar. Those 
three other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the teahouse, 
and the <zur khaneh> (the latter a kind of club in which a leader 
and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics, 
dance, chanted poetry, and music), do not take place in buildings 
to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them occupy splendid 
examples of Persian domestic architecture: long, domed, chalk-white 
rooms with daises of turquoise tile, their end walls cut through 
to the orchards and the sky by open arches.   But more important, 
and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often 
do not see, is that these places and activities are often the settings 
in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities. 
Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the human form- these things 
are important to Persians, and they experience them with an intense 
and discriminating awareness.   I should like, by the way, to make 
it clear that I am not using the word "Persians" carelessly. 
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations, like 
a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool. These things 
are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to 
the most ordinary. The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's 
night are as often as not the <lutihaw,> mustachioed toughs 
who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons, brothels, 
and teahouses. A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord 
who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring 
famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor. Not long 
ago an acquaintance, a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw 
of the city, stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks. 
The air, he said, was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly 
good. I really didn't know what he meant. It was a nice day, 
granted. But <he> knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his 
lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.   The natural world 
then, plus poetry and some kinds of art, receives from the most ordinary 
of Persians a great deal of attention. The line of an eyebrow, 
the color of the skin, a ghazal from Hafiz, the purity of spring water, 
the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of 
a pavilion- these things are noticed, judged, and valued.   Nowhere 
in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so 
well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge. There has probably 
always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the 
city. For one thing, there is a natural belt of rock across the river 
bed; for another, it was here that one of the old caravan routes came 
in. It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans, 
and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah Abbas /2, 
in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick, tile, and stone, the present 
bridge. It is a splendid structure. From upstream it looks like a 
long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream, where the 
water level is much lower, it is a high, elaborately facaded pavilion.

The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from 
each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile. At either end and 
in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed 
and capacious as church apses. Here, in the old days- when they 
had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and 
his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged 
in the smaller alcoves between.   Below, twenty vaults tunnel 
through the understructure of the bridge. These are traversed by 
another line of vaults, and thus rooms, arched on all four sides, are 
formed. Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing 
vista like a visual echo of piers and arches, while the vaults fronting 
upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and 
river pools. Here, on the hottest day, it is cool beneath the stone 
and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the 
vaults.   On the downstream, or "pavilion", side these vaults 
give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself. From the 
terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the 
water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river. 
Out of water, brick, and tile they have made far more than just a 
bridge.   On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops 
and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge. It 
is a great spectacle. The bridge itself rises up from the river, light-flared 
and enormous, like the outdoor set for an epic opera. Crowds 
press along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the arcades, 
massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege. All kinds 
come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering 
over a deal; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes 
who stand with the stillness of the blind, their eyes filmed with 
rheum and visions; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient 
limousines; students, civil servants, beggars, musicians, hawkers, 
and clowns. Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on 
carpets around a samovar. Below, people line the steps, as though on 
bleachers, to watch the sky and river. Above, in the tiled prosceniums 
of the alcoves, boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi, while at 
the very bottom, in the vaults, the toughs and blades of the city hoot 
and bang their drums, drink arak, play dice, and dance.   Here 
in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important 
to them: poetry, water, the moon, a beautiful face. To a stranger 
their delight in these things may seem paradoxical, for Persians chase 
the golden calf as much as any people. Many of them, moreover, are 
beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to 
ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant, the mullah, and the peasant. 
Nonetheless, they take time out- much time- from the game of 
grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks. 
Above all, they will stop in the middle of anything, anywhere, 
to hear or quote some poetry.   Poetry in Persian life is far 
more than a common ground on which- in a society deeply fissured by 
antagonisms- all may stand. It contains, in fact, their whole outlook 
on life. And it is expressed, at least to their taste, in a perfect 
form. Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty. 
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the 
libraries and museums. In Persia, where practically speaking there 
are no museums or libraries or, for that matter, hardly any books, the 
twins run free.   It is perhaps difficult to conceive, but imagine 
that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End 
will gather to sing Marlowe, Herrick, Shakespeare, and perhaps some 
lyrics of their own. That, at any rate, is what happens at the Khaju 
bridge. Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the 
top arcade. Here in these little rooms- or stages arched open to 
the sky and river- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they 
may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian 
music is divided. Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute- 
one inducing pleasure, another generosity, another love, and so 
on, to include all of the emotions. The singer simply matches the poem 
to a mode; for example, the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk 
poem: "<They brought me news that Spring is in the plains And 
Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains; Go, tell his aged mother 
that her son Fought with a thousand foes, and he was one>". 
Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet: "<Know 
ye, fair folk who dwell on earth Or shall hereafter come to birth, That 
here, with dust upon his eyes, Iraj, the sweet-tongued singer, lies. 
In this true lover's tomb interred A world of love lies sepulchred> 
**h".   These songs (practically all Persian music, for 
that matter) are limited to a range of two octaves. Yet within this 
limitation there is an astonishing variety: design as intricate as 
that in the carpet or miniature, with the melodic line like the painted 
or woven line often flowing into an arabesque. 
<Die Frist ist um, und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr,> the 
Maestro quoted <The Flying Dutchman,> as he told of his career 
and wanderings, explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred 
in his life several times.   The music director of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra, William Steinberg, has molded his group 
into a prominent musical organization, which is his life. When he 
added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London 
Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958, he conducted one hundred fifty concerts 
within nine months, "commuting" between the two cities. This 
schedule became too strenuous, even for the energetic and conscientious 
Mr& Steinberg. His London contract was rescinded, and now, he 
explains cheerfully, as a bright smile lightens his intense, mobile face, 
"I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts"!   Our 
meeting took place in May, 1961, during one of the Maestro's stop-overs 
in New York, before he left for Europe. As we began to converse 
in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel, his restlessness and 
sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent. Seeking 
an obscure, dark, relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise 
suffused with afternoon sunshine, he asked if the soft background music 
could be turned off. Unfortunately, it was Muzak, which automatically 
is piped into the public rooms, and which <nolens volens> had to 
be endured. As he talked about himself, time and again stuffing and 
dragging on his pipe, Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried 
feeling grew faint and was dispelled.   Did he come from a musical 
family? Yes: though not professional musicians, they were a 
music-loving family. In his native Cologne, where his mother taught 
him to play the piano, he was able to read notes before he learned the 
alphabet. She even devised a system of colors, whereby the boy could 
easily distinguish the different note values. When he started school 
at the age of five-and-a-half, he could not understand why the alphabet 
begins with the letter ~A, instead of ~C, as in the scale. Because, 
like many other children, he intensely disliked practicing Czerny 
<Etudes,> he composed his own studies. When he was eight he began 
violin lessons. Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra, 
and during World War /1,, when musicians were scarce, he 
joined the opera orchestra as well. Steinberg claims that these early 
years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career. 
"By observing the conductor", he says with a twinkle in his 
eyes, "I learned how not to conduct".   The musician ran away 
from school when he was fifteen, but this escapade did not save him 
from the Gymnasium. Simultaneously, he pursued his musical studies 
at the conservatory, receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony, 
as well in the violin and piano. His professional career began when 
he was twenty; he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant 
at the Cologne Opera, and a year later was promoted to the position 
of regular conductor.   Wasn't this an unusually young age to 
fill such a responsible post? Yes, the Maestro assented.   Had 
he always wished to be a conductor? No, originally he had hoped 
to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such. However, 
when he assumed the duties of a conductor, he relinquished his career 
as a pianist.   Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera, 
after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky, teacher 
of Arnold Scho^nberg and Erich Korngold. In 1927 he succeeded 
Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague. 
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin 
State Opera. Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera, 
where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the 
rise of the Hitler regime. During these years the youthful conductor 
had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany. 
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's 
<Manon Lescaut> and de Falla's 
<La Vida Breve>. The Frankfurt 
years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's 
<Wozzek> soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber, 
and the world premiere of Scho^nberg's <Von heute auf morgen>. 
At the outset of his career, Steinberg had dedicated himself to the 
advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Scho^nberg work 
every year. In Frankfurt, too, he directed the Museum and Opera 
House concerts which, in addition to the standard repertoire, featured 
novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth 
Symphony.   Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 
1930's, 
Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish 
community. Through the Frankfurt Jewish <Kulturbund> he began 
to give sonata recitals in synagogues, with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann. 
As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional 
organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt <Kulturbund> 
Orchestra, which also gave guest performances in other German 
cities. In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin <Kulturbund>. 
In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin 
and Frankfurt <Kulturbund> orchestras joined under the combined efforts 
of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine 
Orchestra- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra- with 
Steinberg as founder-conductor.   In 1938, at the insistence 
of Arturo Toscanini, Steinberg left Germany for the United States, 
by way of Switzerland. After he had spent the first three years 
in New York as associate conductor, at Toscanini's invitation, of 
the ~NBC Orchestra, he made numerous guest appearances throughout 
the United States and Latin America. In 1945 he became conductor 
of the Buffalo Philharmonic. Seven years later he was asked to become 
director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. Since 1944 he has also conducted 
regularly at the San Francisco Opera, where he made his debut 
with a memorable performance of Verdi's <Falstaff>. In recent 
years he has traveled widely in Europe, conducting in Italy, France, 
Austria, and Switzerland. He returned to Germany for the first 
time in 1953, where he has since conducted in Cologne, Frankfurt, 
and Berlin.   Where in Europe was he going now?   First 
of all, to Italy for a short vacation- Forte dei Marmi, a place 
he loves. Since it is not far from Viareggio, he will visit Puccini's 
house, as he never fails to do, to pay his respects to the memory 
of the composer of <La Boheme,> which he considers one of Puccini's 
masterpieces. Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about 
Italy: "Rome is my second home. I consider it the center of the 
world and make it a point to be there once a year". He will conduct 
two concerts at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, as well as concerts 
in Munich and Cologne. "Then I return to the United States 
for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia", he 
added.   The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to 
be of unusual interest. There will be premieres of new works, made possible 
through Ford Foundation commissions: Carlisle Floyd's <Mystery,> 
with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist. Other world premieres 
will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's 
<Samba Concertante>.   "And next year we will do- also 
a Ford commission- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter, with Jacob 
Lateiner as soloist. Of course, I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner 
works in the coming season, as usual. We'll play Bruckner's 
Fifth Symphony in the original version, and Mahler's Seventh- 
the least accessible, known, and played of Mahler's works. My Pittsburghers 
have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner".

He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters 
on tour, especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies, and 
<Das Lied von der Erde,> and Bruckner's Sixth- which is rarely 
played- and Seventh. Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as "my 
travel symphony". He recalled that in California after a critic 
had attacked him for "still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans", 
the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.

"Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and 
my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us, I am probably 
the only one- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein- 
who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner 
and Mahler".   Since he introduces so much modern music, 
I could not resist asking how he felt about it.   "There was 
always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era 
in which it was created. But I usually stick to the old phrase: 
<'Ich habe ein Amt, aber keine Meinung> (I hold an office, but 
I do not feel entitled to have an opinion). I consider it to be my 
job to expose the public to what is being written today".   With 
all his musical activities, did he have the time and inclination to 
do anything else? He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection 
to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals. 
He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain, 
but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able 
to see in Paris a year ago.   And how did he feel about modern 
art? Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he 
was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments. "As my wife puts 
it", he said, again with a twinkle in his eyes, "all you know is 
your music. But after all, you never learned anything else"!

What did he do for relaxation? Like his late colleague, Mitropoulos, 
he reads mystery stories, in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature.

But his prime interest, apart from music, he insisted seriously, was 
his family- his wife, daughter and son. At the moment he was excited 
about his son's having received the Prix de Rome in archaeology 
and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation 
of an Etruscan tomb. "Both children are musical and my wife is 
a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgment". 
"IS the attitude of German youth comparable to that of "the 
angry 
young men' of England"? was the topic for a round-table discussion 
at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich.   I was chairman, 
the only not youthful participant. Since attack serves to stimulate 
interest in broadcasts, I added to my opening statement a sentence in 
which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which 
is a necessary ingredient of anger, and might be classified as uninterested 
and bored rather than angry. I was far from convinced of the 
truth of my statement, but could not think of anything that might evoke 
responses more quickly.   "It is easy for you to talk"; 
countered a twenty year old law student, "you travel around the world. 
We would like to do that too".   "But you want a job guaranteed 
when you return", I continued my attack. "You must have 
some security", said a young clerk.   When I mentioned that 
for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return 
fare, but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount, 
the young people looked at me doubtingly. One girl expressed what was 
obviously in their minds.   "Would you advise us to act the 
same way? You might have failed. I think it is rather foolhardy to 
trust to luck".   Others mentioned that I might have had to 
ask 
friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign 
country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international 
understanding.   The debate needed no additional controversy 
and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life, what 
his hopes were and what his fears.   Though the four boys and 
two girls, the youngest nineteen years of age, the oldest twenty-four, 
came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal 
interests, there was surprising agreement among them. What they 
wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political 
instability in their own country.   The ideal home, they 
agreed, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to 
five rooms, just enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and 
two children. No one wanted a larger family or no children, and none 
hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would 
be satisfactory.   All expressed interest in world affairs 
but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.

ONCE again, as in the days of the Founding Fathers, America 
faces a stern test. That test, as President Kennedy forthrightly 
depicted it in his State of the Union message, will determine "whether 
a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure".

It is well then that in this hour both of "national peril" 
and of "national opportunity" we can take counsel with the men who 
made the nation. Incapable of self-delusion, the Founding Fathers 
found the crisis of their time to be equally grave, and yet they had 
confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free 
peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.

Seven Founders- George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, 
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James 
Madison and John Jay- determined the destinies of the new nation. 
In certain respects, their task was incomparably greater than ours today, 
for there was nobody before them to show them the way. As Madison 
commented to Jefferson in 1789, "We are in a wilderness without 
a single footstep to guide us. Our successors will have an easier task".

They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words, 
as "the Argonauts" who had lived in "the Heroic Age". Accordingly, 
they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential 
sources for posterity. Their writings assume more than dramatic or 
patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in 
which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but, rather, 
as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen, 
that "with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved".

Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point 
of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven were essentially 
congenial minds, and their agreements with each other were more consequential 
than their differences. Even though in most cases the completion 
of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off, 
enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing 
a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual 
feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.

Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember 
that their separate careers were extraordinary. Certainly no other 
seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in 
so concentrated a span of years.   Eldest of the seven, Benjamin 
Franklin, a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the 
most dazzling success story in our history. The young printer's apprentice 
achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields, as editor 
and publisher, scientist, inventor, philanthropist and statesman. 
Author of the Albany Plan of Union, which, had it been adopted, might 
have avoided the Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line 
battles in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and 
the peace that ended the war, headed the state government of Pennsylvania, 
and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal 
Convention. ##

ON a military mission for his native Virginia 
the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian 
War, then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia. 
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution, 
he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory. Retiring 
to his beloved Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal 
Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected 
President. During his two terms the Constitution was tested and 
found workable, strong national policies were inaugurated, and the 
traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed. 
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology, wrote 
the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts, negotiated, 
with Franklin and Jay, the peace with Britain and served as our first 
Vice President and our second President. ##

HIS political 
opponent and lifetime friend, Thomas Jefferson, achieved immortality 
through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, but 
equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted 
in his native Virginia, his role as father of our territorial system, 
and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first 
term as President.   During the greater part of Jefferson's 
career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian, James 
Madison, eight years his junior. The active sponsor of Jefferson's 
measure for religious liberty in Virginia, Madison played the most 
influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in 
securing its ratification in Virginia, founded the first political 
party in American history, and, as Jefferson's Secretary of State 
and his successor in the Presidency, guided the nation through the 
troubled years of our second war with Britain.   If Franklin was 
an authentic genius, then Alexander Hamilton, with his exceptional 
precocity, consuming energy, and high ambition, was a political prodigy. 
His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was only 19, quickly 
brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders. Principal author 
of "The Federalist", he swung New York over from opposition 
to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly. His 
collaboration with Washington, begun when he was the general's aide 
during the Revolution, was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet 
as Secretary of the Treasury. His bold fiscal program and his broad 
interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions. 
##

LESS dazzling than Hamilton, less eloquent than Jefferson, 
John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers. 
He served as president of the Continental Congress. He played 
the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that 
ended the Revolution, and directed America's foreign affairs throughout 
the Confederation period. As first Chief Justice, his strong 
nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall. He ended his public 
career as a two-term governor of New York.   These Seven Founders 
constituted an intellectual and social elite, the most respectable 
and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed. Their 
social status was achieved in some cases by birth, as with Washington, 
Jefferson and Jay; in others by business and professional acumen, 
as with Franklin and Adams, or, in Hamilton's case, by an influential 
marriage. Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals 
in underdeveloped nations of our own day, they commanded both prestige 
and influence before the Revolution started.   As different 
physically as the tall, angular Jefferson was from the chubby, rotund 
Adams, the seven were striking individualists. Ardent, opinionated, 
even obstinate, they were amazingly articulate, wrote their own copy, 
and were masters of phrasemaking. ##

CAPABLE of enduring friendships, 
they were also stout controversialists, who could write with 
a drop of vitriol on their pens. John Adams dismissed John Dickinson, 
who voted against the Declaration of Independence, as "a certain 
great fortune and piddling genius". Washington castigated his 
critic, General Conway, as being capable of "all the meanness of intrigue 
to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity". And 
Hamilton, who felt it "a religious duty" to oppose Aaron Burr's 
political ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk had 
he shown more literary restraint.   The Seven Founders were 
completely dedicated to the public service. Madison once remarked: 
"My life has been so much a public one", a comment which fits the 
careers of the other six. Franklin retired from editing and publishing 
at the age of 42, and for the next forty-two years devoted himself 
to public, scientific, and philanthropic interests. Washington never 
had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved 
best, plantation management. He served as Commander in Chief during 
the Revolution without compensation. ##

JOHN ADAMS took 
to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley, 
to "pursue the study of the law, rather than the gain of it". In 
taking account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded 
that "no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did" 
and "for so little profit". When the Revolution broke out, he, along 
with Jefferson and Jay, abandoned his career at the bar, with considerable 
financial sacrifice.   Hamilton, poorest of the seven, 
gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet. 
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of 
the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends. 
"If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars", he wrote 
one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury.   To 
support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell 
of public service. Talleyrand passed his New York law office one 
night on the way to a party. Hamilton was bent over his desk, drafting 
a legal paper by the light of a candle. The Frenchman was astonished. 
"I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune 
of his country, but now is working all night in order to support his 
family", he reflected. ##

ALL seven combined ardent devotion 
to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality. John 
Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of 
Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their 
charters, the British Constitution and the common law, and Jefferson 
appealed in the Declaration of Independence "to the tribunal of 
the world" for support of a revolution justified by "the laws of 
nature and of nature's God".   They fought hard, but they were 
forgiving to former foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures 
from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 
1783.   This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified 
in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee, 
Peter Van Schaack. Jay had participated in the decision that exiled 
his old friend Van Schaack. Yet when, at war's end, the ex-Tory 
made the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote him from 
Paris, where he was negotiating the peace settlement: 
"As 
an independent American I considered all who were not for us, and you 
amongst the rest, as against us, yet be assured that John Jay never 
ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack".   The latter 
in turn assured him that "were I arraigned at the bar, and you my 
judge, I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause".

All seven recognized that independence was but the first 
step toward building a nation. "We have now a national character 
to establish", Washington wrote in 1783. "Think continentally", 
Hamilton counseled the young nation. This new force, love of country, 
super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's 
own state, was epitomized by Washington. His first inaugural 
address speaks of "my country whose voice I can never hear but with 
veneration and love".   All sought the fruition of that nationalism 
in a Federal Government with substantial powers. Save Jefferson, 
all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal 
Constitution. They supported it, not as a perfect instrument, but as 
the best obtainable. Historians have traditionally regarded the great 
debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized 
vs& limited government, with Hamilton and the nationalists 
supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter 
position. ##

THE state's rights position was formulated by 
Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves, but 
in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better 
Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians. In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson 
had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution, 
and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's 
bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception, and in 
adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff. Indeed, the old Jeffersonians 
were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they 
were to the Jacksonian Democrats. ##

WHEN, in 1832, the South 
Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition 
which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited 
no encouragement from that senior statesman. In his political testament, 
"Advice to My Country", penned just before his death, Madison 
expressed the wish "that the Union of the States be cherished 
and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora 
with her box opened; and the disguised one, as the serpent creeping 
with his deadly wiles into Paradise". 

#TOBACCO ROAD IS DEAD. LONG LIVE TOBACCO ROAD.#

Nostalgic Yankee 
readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians 
that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway, over 
which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the 
Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop. Thus we are compelled 
to face the urbanization of the South- an urbanization which, despite 
its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture, 
has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers. Indeed, it 
seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road, 
with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint 
juleps, continue to live- but only as a weary, overexploited phantom.

Those writers known collectively as the "Southern school" 
have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize; 
according to many critics, in fact, the South has led the North 
in literature since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren 
have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum 
renaissance. It is interesting, however, that despite this 
strong upsurge in Southern writing, almost none of the writers has 
forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel 
sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the 
season's cotton and tobacco crops; of the stereotyped Negro servants 
chanting hymns as they plow the fields; of these and a host of 
other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps 
of the past century. This is not to say that the South is no longer 
agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification. 
But the South is, and has been for the past century, engaged 
in a wide-sweeping urbanization which, oddly enough, is not reflected 
in its literature.   In 1900 the South was only 15% urban; 
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban. In a mere half-century the South 
has more than tripled its urban status. There is a New South emerging, 
a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with 
the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades. As 
the New South snowballs toward further urbanization, it becomes more 
and more homogeneous with the North- a tendency which Willard 
Thorp terms "Yankeefication", as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte, 
Birmingham, and Houston. It is said that, even at the present 
stage of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly 
unlike Columbus or Trenton. Undoubtedly even the old Southern 
stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind: William Styron mentions 
in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder, a Civil 
War general, now renamed, in typical California fashion, "Buena 
Vista Terrace". The effects of television and other mass media 
are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force. 
As for progress, the "backward South" can boast of Baton Rouge, 
which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred 
and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second largest growth of the period 
for all cities over 25,000.   The field, then, is ripe for 
new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century 
phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication: the new urban economy, 
the city-dweller, the pains of transition, the labor problems; the 
list is, obviously, endless. But these sources have not been tapped. 
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism, exaggerating 
the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque, but 
as unreal as- or even <more> unreal than- yesterday. William 
Styron, while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance, 
insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and 
yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes. 
Even the great god Faulkner, the South's one probable contender 
for literary immortality, has little concerned himself with these matters; 
such are simply not within his bounded province.   Where 
are the writers to treat these changes? Has the agrarian tradition 
become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded 
or unwanted? Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the 
older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated 
testings over the decades. Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to 
write of a <new> economy, these writers seem to be contenting themselves 
with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.

An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region 
may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in 
the white-dominated society, a problem that has been reflected in regional 
fiction especially since 1865. Today the Negro must discover his 
role in an <industrialized> South, which indicates that the racial 
aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically, but rather 
has gradually come to be reflected in this new context, this new coat 
of paint. The Negro faces as much, if not more, difficulty in fitting 
himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one. This 
represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem. But there 
have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins, the picket lines, 
the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago. 
Today's evidence, such as the fact that only three Southern states 
(South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi) still openly defy integration, 
would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness.

Other examples of <gradual> changes that have 
affected the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the busses; 
his requesting, and often getting, higher wages, better working conditions, 
better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before 
the Supreme Court decision of 1954. Then came this decision, which 
sped the process of gaining equality (or perhaps hindered it; only 
historical evolution will determine which): an <abrupt> change.

Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led 
to an ironically anarchical rebellion. He has frequently refused to move 
from white lunch counters, refused to obey <local> laws which he 
considers unjust, while in other cases he has appealed to <federal> 
laws. This bold self-assertion, after decades of humble subservience, 
is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon, an abrupt change in the Southern 
way of existence. A new order is thrusting itself into being. 
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation, 
uncertainty, and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role 
in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white 
man.   The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern 
fiction. It is clear that, while most writers enjoy picturing 
the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble old agrarian who mutters "yassuhs" 
and "sho' nufs" with blissful deference to his white employer 
(or, in Old South terms, "massuh"), this stereotype is doomed 
to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester. While 
there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through 
the rural South, such men appear to be a vanishing breed. Writers 
openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man; 
but they obviously mean by this, not a Negro personality, but a Negro 
<type>. Presenting an individualized Negro character, it would 
seem, is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could 
tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is, as suggested above, 
glaringly rare.   Just as the Negro situation points up the 
gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life, it also points up 
the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature. The book 
concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed; 
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel, <Peaceable Lane>, has 
openly faced the problem.   All but the most rabid of Confederate 
flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in 
actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance 
of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid 
ante-bellum way of life. Many earlier writers, mourning the demise 
of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate this "gracious 
Old South" imagery, creating such lasting impressions as Margaret 
Mitchell's 
"Tara" plantation. Modern writers, who are supposed 
to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist 
upon drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when it well deserves 
a rest after the overexploitation of the past century. Perhaps 
these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but 
they can hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama is dead. 
As John T& Westbrook says in his article, "Twilight of Southern 
Regionalism" (<Southwest Review>, Winter 1957): "**h 
The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South, already too minutely 
autopsied in prose and poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever 
dead and (let us fervently hope) forever done with".   Westbrook 
further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image 
of their homeland, which is too readily assimilated by both foreign 
readers and visiting Yankees: "Our northerner is suspicious of 
all this crass evidence [of urbanization] presented to his senses. 
It bewilders and befuddles him. He is too deeply steeped in William 
Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren. The fumes of progress are in his 
nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes, but his 
heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night 
riders. On this trip to the South he wants, above all else, to sniff 
the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at 
least one barn burn at midnight". Obviously, such a Northern tourist's 
purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland: 
he <wants> to see a world of make-believe.   In the 
meantime, while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization 
that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee, Southern writers 
have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's 
progress. Willard Thorp, in his new book <American Writing in 
the Twentieth Century>, observes, quite validly it seems: "**h 
Certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched. 
No southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what 
Herrick, Dreiser, and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did 
for New York **h There are almost no fictional treatments of the 
industrialized south". Not a single Southern author, major or minor, 
has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material.

Faulkner, for one, appears to be safe from the accusing 
fingers of all assailants in this regard. Faulkner culminates the 
Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been, or could 
ever be, done. He has made it his, and his it remains, irrevocably. 
He treats it with a mythological, universal application.   As 
his disciples boast, even though his emphasis is elsewhere, Faulkner 
does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly, 
as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes 
families. Even two decades ago in <Go Down, Moses> Faulkner 
was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through 
its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the 
curse of slavery erased from its soil. Yet his concern even here is 
with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general, and he never 
deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial 
impact.   Faulkner traces, in his vast and overpowering saga 
of Yoknapatawpha County, the gradual changes which seep into the 
South, building layer upon layer of minute, subtle innovation which eventually 
tend largely to hide the Old Way. Thus Faulkner reminds 
us, and wisely, that the "new" South has gradually evolved out of 
the Old South, and consequently its agrarian roots persist. Yet he 
presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers 
if not himself: the problems with which a New South must grapple 
in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization. 
With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of 
six men: a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil. The 
thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with 
even greater stress and tension: the sacred wilderness is gradually 
surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.

Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual 
devices of the theatre. Most avant-garde creators, true to their 
interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement, have tended to dress 
their dancers in simple lines and solid colors (often black) and to 
give them a bare cyclorama for a setting. But Robert Rauschenberg, 
the neo-dadaist artist, has collaborated with several of them. He has 
designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white 
for Mr& Cunningham's <Summerspace>, so that dancers and background 
merge into a shimmering unity. For Mr& Taylor's <Images 
and Reflections> he made some diaphanous tents that alternately 
hide and reveal the performer, and a girl's cape lined with grass. Mr& 
Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume 
and decor. In fact, he calls his productions dance-theatre works 
of motion, shape, light, and sound. To raise the dancer out of his personal, 
pedestrian self, Mr& Nikolais has experimented with relating 
him to a larger, environmental orbit. He began with masks to make 
the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be. He 
went on to use objects- hoops, poles, capes- which he employed as 
extensions of the body of the dancer, who moved with them. The depersonalization 
continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play 
of lights upon his figure. In each case, the object, the color, even 
the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become 
part of the theatrical being of the performer. The dancer who never 
loosens her hold on a parasol, begins to feel that it is part of herself. 
Or, clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of 
hoops, the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a "finial". 
As the dancer is depersonalized, his accouterments are animized, 
and the combined elements give birth to a new being. From this being 
come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single 
unit.   Thus, the avant-garde choreographers have extended the 
scope of materials available for dance composition. But, since they 
have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity, how are they 
to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal? Some 
look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply 
corresponding methods to their own work. Others, less consciously 
but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times, experiment 
with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet, painter, 
and musician.   An approach that has appealed to some choreographers 
is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process 
of projective verse: "one perception must immediately and directly 
lead to a further perception". The creator trusts his intuition to 
lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors 
the reality of his experience. He disdains external restrictions- conventional 
syntax, traditional metre. The unit of form is determined 
subjectively: "the Heart, by the way of the Breath, to the Line". 
The test of form is fidelity to the experience, a gauge also accepted 
by the abstract expressionist painters.   An earlier but 
still influential school of painting, surrealism, had suggested the way 
of dealing with the dream experience, that event in which seemingly 
incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations 
of the subconscious. The resulting picture might appear a maze of 
restless confusions and contradictions, but it is more true to life than 
a portrait of an artificially contrived order. The contemporary painter 
tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but 
their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines, colors, masses, 
and energies. He is still concerned, however, with a personal event. 
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence 
of the vitality of the experience of creation. The work must 
be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.

Some painters have less interest in the experience of the 
moment, with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities, than in looking 
beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher, more serene level 
of truth. Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations 
they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design, which symbolize 
an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world. The 
concept remains subjective. But in this approach it is the artist's 
ultimate insight, rather than his immediate impressions, that gives 
form to the work.   Others look to more objective devices of 
order. The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes 
a mathematical system of rotations that, once set in motion, 
determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities. 
The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of 
intervals (or rhythms or dynamic changes). He may even alter the pattern 
by applying a scheme of random numbers. But he cannot order his 
elements by will, either rational or inspired. The system works as an 
impersonal mechanism. Musicians who use the chance method also exclude 
subjective control of formal development. Again, the composer must 
select his own materials. But a tossing of coins, with perhaps the added 
safeguard of reference to the oracles of the <I Ching>, the Chinese 
Book of Changes, dictates the handling of the chosen materials.

Avant-garde choreographers, seeking new forms of continuity 
for their new vocabulary of movements, have turned to similar approaches. 
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation. 
According to Katherine Litz, "the becoming, the process of realization, 
is the dance". The process stipulates that the choreographer 
sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that 
he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it. The sequence 
may involve a sharp contrast: for example, a quiet meditative sway 
of the body succeeded by a violent leap; or it may involve more subtle 
distinctions: the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged, 
its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified, or it may be transferred 
to become a movement of only the arms or the head. Even the least 
alteration will change the quality. An exploration of these possible 
relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form 
to the dance.   The approach to the depiction of the experience 
of creation may be analytic, as it is for Miss Litz, or spontaneous, 
as it is for Merle Marsicano. She, too, is concerned with "the 
becoming, the process of realization", but she does not think in 
terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns. The design 
is determined emotionally: "I must reach into myself for the spring 
that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event 
with which the dance confronts me". Looking back, Miss Marsicano 
feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock. 
At one time she felt impelled to make dances that "moved all 
over the stage", much as Pollock's paintings move violently over 
the full extent of the canvas. But her conscious need was to break away 
from constricting patterns of form, a need to let the experience shape 
itself.   Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity 
that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement. It 
may be a free front-back swing of the leg, leading to a sideways swing 
of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off 
from the ground. This became a dance called <Prelude to Flight>. 
A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close 
to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.

Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal 
emotion. He seeks to make his dancers more "godlike" by relating 
them to the impersonal elements of shape, light color, and sound. If 
his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures 
from Mars, this is consistent with his intention of placing them in 
the orbit of another world, a world in which they are freed of their 
pedestrian identities. It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the 
germ of form is discovered. In his recognition of his impersonal self 
the dancer moves, and this self, in the "first revealed stroke of 
its existence", states the theme from which all else must follow. The 
theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve. 
It may be a reaction to a percussive sound, the following movements 
constituting further reactions. It may establish the relation of the 
figure of the dancer to light and color, in which case changes in the 
light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs. Unconcerned 
with the practical function of his actions, the dancer is engrossed 
exclusively in their "motional content". Movements unfold freely 
because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive. 
But the metamorphosis must come first.   Though he is also concerned 
with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity, Merce 
Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim. 
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity, any line of action 
related to the concept of cause and effect. He bases his approach 
on the belief that anything can follow anything. An order can be chanced 
rather than chosen, and this approach produces an experience that 
is "free and discovered rather than bound and remembered". Thus, 
there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance 
but in the shape of their continuity as well. Chance, he finds, enables 
him to create "a world beyond imagination". He cites with pleasure 
the comment of a lady, who exclaimed after a concert: "Why, 
it's extremely interesting. But I would never have thought of it myself".

The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is 
unlike any sequence to be seen in life. At one side of the stage a dancer 
jumps excitedly; nearby, another sits motionless, while still another 
is twirling an umbrella. A man and a girl happen to meet; they 
look straight at the audience, not at each other. He lifts her, puts 
her down, and walks off, neither pleased nor disturbed, as if nothing 
had happened. If one dancer slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette, 
sit down, or offer his assailant a fork and spoon. Events occur 
without apparent reason. Their consequences are irrelevant- or there 
are no consequences at all.   The sequence is determined by 
chance, and Mr& Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance 
devices. He may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab 
bag. The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal 
organization of the dance but also its spatial design, special 
slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be 
performed. The other variables include the dancer who is to perform 
the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance. 
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the 
movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and the approximate 
total duration of the dance. The "approximate" is important, because 
even after the order of the work has been established by the chance 
method, the result is not inviolable. Each performance may be different. 
If a work is divided into several large segments, a last-minute 
drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for 
any particular performance. And any sequence can not only change its 
positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.

Mr& Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he 
adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can. However, there is always 
the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible 
to execute. Then the choreographer must arbitrate. He must 
rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other. 
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone 
one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation 
for the leap.

THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH were in greater agreement on sovereignty, 
through all their dispute about it, than were the Founding Fathers. 
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen 
of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun, and defended in the end 
by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee. The people everywhere 
had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles, in 
understanding of and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their 
Union. Repeated efforts- beginning with the Missouri Compromise 
of 1821- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas 
to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise, rather than clear 
thought and timely action. Even so, confusion in this period gained 
such strength (from compromise and other factors) that it led to the 
bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century. Nothing can show more than 
this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in 
even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.

The present issue in Atlantica- whether to transform an 
alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens- 
resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that 
was resolved by Civil War. And so I would only touch upon it now 
(much as I have long wanted to write a book about it). I think it is 
essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts 
of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better 
how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse 
confusion on this subject.   The difference came down to this: 
The Southern States insisted that the United States was, in last 
analysis, what its name implied- a Union of States. To their leaders 
the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign 
states, who therefore retained the right to secede from it. This right 
of the State, its upholders contended, was essential to maintain 
the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger 
of centralizing power in the Union government. The champions of 
the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, 
the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign 
citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right 
to secede, though the citizens could. Writing to Speed on August 
24, 1855, Lincoln made the latter point clear. In homely terms whose 
timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to secede. 
"  We began by declaring that <all men are created equal>. 
We now practically read it, <all men are created equal except negroes>. 
When the Know-nothings get control, it will read, <All 
men 
are created equal except negroes> and foreigners and Catholics. When 
it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where 
they make no pretence of loving liberty- to Russia, for instance, where 
despotism can be taken pure, without the base alloy of hypocrisy". 
[His emphasis]   When the Southern States exercised 
their "right to secede", they formed what they officially styled "The 
Confederate States of America". Dictionaries, as we have 
seen, still cite this government, along with the Articles of Confederation 
of 1781, as an example of a confederacy. The fact is that the 
Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as 
the Federal Constitution did. The Confederate Constitution copied 
much of the Federal Constitution verbatim, and most of the rest in 
substance. It operated on, by and for the people individually just as 
did the Federal Constitution. It made substantially the same division 
of power between the central and state governments, and among the 
executive, legislative and judicial branches. 

#THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
CONFEDERACY AND FEDERAL UNION IN 1861#

Many believe- and understandably- 
that the great difference between the Constitution of 
the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the 
former recognized the right of each state to secede. But though each 
of its members had asserted this right against the Union, the final 
Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11- nearly a month 
before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing 
a state to secede. Its drafters discussed this vital point but 
left it out of their Constitution. Their President, Jefferson Davis, 
interpreted their Constitution to mean that it "admits of no coerced 
association", but this reremained so doubtful that "there were 
frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution".

The Constitution of the Southern "Confederation" 
differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects: 
It openly, defiantly, recognized slavery- an institution 
which the Southerners of 1787, even though they continued it, found so 
impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning 
the word in the Federal Constitution. They recognized that 
slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest, and that 
to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive 
contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in 
the Declaration of 1776 that "all men are created equal, that they 
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among 
them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness **h". The 
other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the 
President of the Confederacy held office for six (instead of four) 
years, and was limited to one term.   These are not, however, differences 
in federal structure. The only important differences from that 
standpoint, between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles. 
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people 
were acting through their states, whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 
expressed, as clearly as language can, the opposite concept, that they 
were acting directly as citizens. Here are the two Preambles: _FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTION, 1789_ "we the People of the United States, 
in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure 
domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence, promote the general 
Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and 
our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America". _CONFEDERATE CONSTITUTION, 1861_ "We 
the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its 
sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal 
government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure 
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking 
the favor and the guidance of Almighty God- do ordain and establish 
this Constitution for the Confederate States of America".

One is tempted to say that, on the difference between the concepts 
of sovereignty in these two preambles, the worst war of the Nineteenth 
century was fought. But though the Southern States, when drafting 
a constitution to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this 
fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede, the fact remained 
that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept 
that it was composed primarily of sovereign states. If the Union 
conceded this to them, the same right must be conceded to each remaining 
state whenever it saw fit to secede: This would destroy the federal 
balance between it and the states, and in the end sacrifice to 
the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained 
by their Union.   Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the 
issue for the Union a vital one: Whether it was a Union of sovereign 
citizens that should continue to live, or an association of sovereign 
states that must fall prey either to "anarchy or despotism".

Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always willing to 
concede to each "slave state" the right to decide independently whether 
to continue or end it. Though his election was interpreted by 
many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal 
balance in favor of the Union, Lincoln himself proposed no such change 
in the rights the Constitution gave the states. After the war began, 
he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action 
even in the Border States that stayed with the Union. He issued 
his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left 
him no other way to save the Union. In his Message of December 
2, 1862, he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which I 
would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union: <"In giving 
freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free">.   What 
Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people 
were sovereign in the Union. He fought to the end to preserve it 
as a "government of the people, by the people, for the people". 

#THE 
TRUTH ON EACH SIDE WON IN THE CIVIL WAR#

The fact that the Americans 
who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to 
keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis 
of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer, and the greater. 
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged, in the South as in the North, 
as America's true sovereign, in "a new birth of freedom", as 
Lincoln promised. But before this came about, 214,938 Americans had 
given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights 
of men and of states.   On their decisive battlefield Lincoln 
did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the "brave 
men, living and dead, who fought here". He understood that both 
sides were at fault, and he reached the height of saying so explicitly 
in his Second Inaugural.   To my knowledge, Lincoln remains 
the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who, while fighting 
a fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough to say this 
publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human 
truth there is some error, and in all our error, some truth. So great 
a man could not but understand, too, that the thing that moves men to 
sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought, which their 
opponents see and attack, but the truth which the latter do not see- 
any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves 
defend.   It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day 
to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives 
in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had 
delegated to the States and to their Union. They differed in the 
balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen- 
but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental 
truth: That individual life, liberty and happiness depend 
on a right balance between the two- and on the limitation of sovereignty, 
in all its aspects, which this involves. The 140,414 Americans 
who gave "the last full measure of devotion" to prevent disunion, 
preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers 
of anarchy, inherent in confederations, which throughout history have 
proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign 
states, and to the liberties of their people. But the fact that 
70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing 
concept served Liberty-and-Union in other essential ways.

Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing 
the Southerners their right to have slaves- a right that was even 
less compatible with the sovereignty of man. The very fact that they 
came so near to winning by the wrong method, war, led directly to their 
losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for, since it forced 
Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure. There was 
a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another. There was also a 
lesson, one that has served ever since to keep Americans, in their conflicts 
with one another, from turning from the ballot to the bullet. 
Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case, 
they did not lose the truth they fought for. The lives so many of them 
gave, to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment 
by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued 
ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe. 
As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new "unnatural" and 
internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with 
the entropy-increasing properties of the external world. The useful 
suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a 
third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with 
our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique 
for building protective artificial environments. One wonders 
about its applicability to people. Will advances in human sciences help 
us build social structures and governments which will enable us to 
cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein 
and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to 
adapt to a sea of molecular interaction? The answer is of course yes. 
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit, composed 
of people, which gives us both some immunity from, and a way of dealing 
with, other people. Social invention did not have to await social 
theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier 
or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes. 
But it has been during the last two centuries, during the scientific 
revolution, that our independence from the physical environment has 
made the most rapid strides. We have ample light when the sun sets; 
the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly 
through the air, although gravity pulls us down; the range of our 
voice ignores distance. At what stage are social sciences then? Is 
the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time 
of Newton? There is a haunting resemblance between the notion 
of cause in Copernicus and in Freud. And it is certainly no slight 
to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.

Political theoretical understanding, although almost at a standstill 
during this century, did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries, and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased 
the possibility for man to coexist with man. Consitutional government, 
popular vote, trial by jury, public education, labor unions, cooperatives, 
communes, socialized ownership, world courts, and the veto 
power in world councils are but a few examples. Most of these, with 
horrible exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an attempt to 
quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny its force, but as a means to 
survive and enjoy it. The most effective political inventions seem to 
make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters 
can play only a minor part in the whole scheme. Just as present 
technology had to await the explanations of physics, so one might 
expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding. 
We are desperately in the need of such invention, for man is 
still very much at the mercy of man. In fact the accumulation of the 
hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other. 
#/3,#

I want, therefore, to discuss a second and quite different 
fruit of science, the connection between scientific understanding 
and fear. There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human 
sciences which in themselves and even without political invention 
can help to dispel our present fears. Lucretius has remarked: "The 
reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all 
sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause, 
and these they attribute to the will of God". Perhaps things 
were even worse then. It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears 
of man. We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and 
from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people 
now than man ever was. We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in 
the same way that people once feared comets. The bombs are as harmless 
as an automobile in a garage. We are worried about what people may 
do with them- that some crazy fool may "push the button". 
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human 
fears, but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific 
explanations that stand out quite clearly. They are in general 
those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual. 
They include both individual fears and collective ones. They arise 
in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not 
only on the external world, but also on the precise pattern of behavior 
of the individual or group. Often it is recognized that all the details 
of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but, because 
the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical 
understanding, one is never quite certain which behavior elements 
are effective, and the whole pattern becomes ritualized. Yet often 
fear persists because, even with the most rigid ritual, one is never 
quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or 
that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive 
act. To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates 
the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much 
of magic and superstition. But a somewhat more detailed analysis 
of this process may be illuminating.   The frequently postulated 
antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness 
apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize. 
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly 
cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people 
to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice. This and other 
fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually, first, with the 
Ptolemaic 
system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then, more 
firmly, with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could 
account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions. 
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one 
can eliminate fear without instituting any controls. In fact, although 
we have dispelled the fear, we have not necessarily assured ourselves 
that there are no dangers. There is still the remote possibility 
of planetoid collision. A meteor could fall on San Francisco. Solar 
activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought. 
Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our 
former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which, in this case, 
amounts to doing nothing. Yet we no longer feel uneasy. This almost 
trivial example is nevertheless suggestive, for there are some elements 
in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter 
and shorter and our present fear of war. We, in our country, think 
of war as an external threat which, if it occurs, will not be primarily 
of our own doing. And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance 
of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way 
on the details of how we behave. What elements of our behavior are decisive? 
Our weapons production, our world prestige, our ideas of democracy, 
our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage? 
We have staved off a war and, since our behavior has involved all 
these elements, we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring 
to abandon any part of it, since we have not the slightest notion which 
parts are effective.   I think that we are here also talking of 
the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching 
at night along the streets of a large city. If an automobile 
were approaching him, he would know what was required of him, even though 
he might not be able to act quickly enough. With the group of boys 
it is different. He does not know whether to look up or look aside, 
to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side, to cross 
the street, or to continue on the same side. When confronted with 
a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them 
might do to me or to himself or to others. I believe that what I do 
has some effect on his actions and I have learned, in a way, to commune 
with drunks, but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly 
the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment 
in physics. I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some 
unwitting slip all hell may break loose. Our inability to explain 
why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of 
ritual and malaise. We are forced, in our behavior towards others, to 
adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a 
minimal understanding of their essential elements.   Our collective 
policies, group and national, are similarly based on voodoo, but 
here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still 
engaged in determing them. We use terms from our personal experience 
with individuals such as "trust", "cheat", and "get tough". 
We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus 
talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles. We 
perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually 
no understanding of social cause and effect. Small wonder, then, 
that we fear.   The achievements which dispelled our fears of 
the cosmos took place three centuries ago. What additional roles has 
the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played? 
In the physical sciences, these achievements concern electricity, chemistry, 
and atomic physics. In the life sciences, there has been an 
enormous increase in our understanding of disease, in the mechanisms of 
heredity, and in bio- and physiological chemistry. The major effect 
of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the 
industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding 
has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment. In 
addition, our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also 
changed. Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding 
is still lacking, but where some explanations are possible, as with 
lightning and weather and earthquakes, the appropriate kind of human action 
has been more adequately indicated.   Apparently the population 
as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations 
of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears. How and 
why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject 
for study. In some areas, the progress is slower than in others. In 
agriculture, for example, despite the advances in biology, elaborate 
rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence 
of some natural disaster. In child care, the opposite extreme prevails; 
procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds 
anything warranted by established psychological theory. There are 
many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite 
appropriate reduction in ritual and fear. Much of the former extreme 
uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death 
has disappeared. The persistent horror of having a malformed child 
has, I believe, been reduced, not because we have gained any control 
over this misfortune, but precisely because we have learned that we 
have so little control over it. In fact, the recent warnings about the 
use of ~X-rays have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which 
now require more detailed understanding, and thus in this instance, 
science has momentarily aggravated our fears. In fact, insofar as 
science generates any fear, it stems not so much from scientific prowess 
and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise, 
which, until they are understood, create uncertainty.   Perhaps 
the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding 
is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease. 
The situation with regard to our attitude and "control" of disease 
contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect 
to people. The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear 
I have tried to describe. 
##

Nothing like Godot, he arrived before the hour. His letter had 
suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday, and I came into 
the lobby as the clock struck twelve. He was waiting.   My wish 
to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest 
in his work. American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays 
nihilistic. They find deep pessimism in them. Even so astute a commentator 
as Harold Clurman of <The Nation> has said that "Waiting 
for Godot" is "the concentrate **h of the contemporary European 
**h mood of despair". But to me Beckett's writing had seemed 
permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that 
I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism. Could it 
be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me? Is his a literature of 
defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face? Or is it relevant 
because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?

I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such 
questions, because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last 
analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself. Nevertheless 
I was curious.   My curiosity was sharpened a day or two 
before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher 
of literature, a Jesuit father, at a conference on religious 
drama near Paris. When Beckett's name came into the discussion, 
the priest 
grew loud and told me that Beckett "hates life". That, 
I thought, is at least one thing I can find out when we meet. ## 

Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish. The features of his face 
are distinct, but not fine. They look as if they had been sculptured 
with an unsharpened chisel. Unruly hair goes straight up from his 
forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show 
that it really is hair and not bristle. One might say it combines 
the man; own pride and humility. For he has the pride that comes of 
self-acceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to 
impose himself upon another. His light blue eyes, set deep within the 
face, are actively and continually looking. He seems, by some unconscious 
division of labor, to have given them that one function and no 
other, leaving communication to the rest of the face. The mouth frequently 
breaks into a disarming smile. The voice is light in timbre, with 
a rough edge that corresponds to his visage. The Irish accent is, 
as one would expect, combined with slight inflections from the French. 
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green. He wore a brown knit 
sports shirt with no tie.   We walked down the Rue de L'Arcade, 
thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe 
opposite that church. The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing 
but it could hardly be called world-shattering. For one thing, 
the world that Beckett sees is already shattered. His talk turns to 
what he calls "the mess", or sometimes "this buzzing confusion". 
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our 
conversation. What appears here is shorter than what he actually said 
but very close to his own words.   "The confusion is not my 
invention. We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without 
being acutely aware of the confusion. It is all around us and our 
only chance now is to let it in. The only chance of renovation is to 
open our eyes and see the mess. It is not a mess you can make sense of".

I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth, 
but Beckett did not take to the word truth.   "What is more 
true than anything else? To swim is true, and to sink is true. 
One is not more true than the other. One cannot speak anymore of being, 
one must speak only of the mess. When Heidegger and Sartre speak 
of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't 
know, but their language is too philosophical for me. I am not a 
philosopher. One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that 
now is simply the mess".   Then he began to speak about the tension 
in art between the mess and form. Until recently, art has withstood 
the pressure of chaotic things. It has held them at bay. It realized 
that to admit them was to jeopardize form. "How could the mess 
be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and 
therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be"? 
But now we can keep it out no longer, because we have come into a 
time when "it invades our experience at every moment. It is there 
and it must be allowed in".   I granted this might be so, but 
found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously. 
And why not? How, I asked, could chaos be admitted to 
chaos? Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art? 
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form. Beckett's 
own work is an example. Plays more highly formalized than "Waiting 
for Godot", "Endgame", and "Krapp's Last Tape" would 
be hard to find.   "What I am saying does not mean that there 
will henceforth be no form in art. It only means that there will 
be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits 
the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something 
else. The form and the chaos remain separate. The latter is not reduced 
to the former. That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation, 
because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates. 
To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of 
the artist now".   Yet, I responded, could not similar things 
be said about the art of the past? Is it not characteristic of the 
greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify, 
demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable 
way? What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting 
to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow 
themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic 
theory? Isn't all art ambiguous?   "Not this", he said, 
and gestured toward the Madeleine. The classical lines of the church 
which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory, dominated all 
the scene where we sat. The Boulevard de la Madeleine, the Boulevard 
Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery, 
bearing tidings of the Age of Reason. "Not this. This is clear. 
This does not allow the mystery to invade us. With classical art, 
all is settled. But it is different at Chartres. There is the unexplainable, 
and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to 
answer".   I asked about the battle between life and death in 
his plays. Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide; Hamm's 
world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living 
child outside. Is this life-death question a part of the chaos?

"Yes. If life and death did not both present themselves to 
us, there would be no inscrutability. If there were only darkness, all 
would be clear. It is because there is not only darkness but also 
light that our situation becomes inexplicable. Take Augustine's doctrine 
of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic 
qualities in this theology? Two thieves are crucified with Christ, 
one saved and the other damned. How can we make sense of this 
division? In classical drama, such problems do not arise. The destiny 
of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed 
into the dark. As she goes, she herself will be illuminated. At 
the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end 
she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that 
she moves toward the dark. That is the play. Within this notion clarity 
is possible, but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there 
is not such clarity. The question would also be removed if we believed 
in the contrary- total salvation. But where we have both dark 
and light we have also the inexplicable. The key word in my plays is 
'perhaps'". ##

Given a theological lead, I asked what he 
thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.

"Well, really there is none at all. I have no religious feeling. 
Once I had a religious emotion. It was at my first Communion. 
No more. My mother was deeply religious. So was my brother. He knelt 
down at his bed as long as he could kneel. My father had none. The 
family was Protestant, but for me it was only irksome and I let it 
go. My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they 
died. At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old-school 
tie. Irish Catholicism is not attractive, but it is deeper. When 
you pass a church on an Irish bus, all the hands flurry in the sign of 
the cross. One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps 
also the pigs".   But do the plays deal with the same facets 
of experience religion must also deal with?   "Yes, for they 
deal with distress. Some people object to this in my writing. At a 
party an English intellectual- so-called- asked me why I write 
always about distress. As if it were perverse to do so! He wanted 
to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home 
to give me an unhappy childhood. I told him no, that I had had a very 
happy childhood. Then he thought me more perverse than ever. I left 
the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi. On the glass partition 
between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help 
for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for 
the war refugees. One does not have to look for distress. It is screaming 
at you even in the taxis of London".   Lunch was over, 
and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming 
at us. ##

The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar 
to qualities I had found in the plays. He says nothing that compresses 
experience within a closed pattern. "Perhaps" stands in 
place of commitment. At the same time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly 
friendly. If there were only the mess, all would be clear; but 
there is also compassion.   As a Christian, I know I do not 
stand where Beckett stands, but I do see much of what he sees. As a 
writer on the theater, I have paid close attention to the plays. Harold 
Clurman is right to say that "Waiting for Godot" is a reflection 
(he calls it a distorted reflection) "of the impasse and disarray 
of Europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life". 
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to. "Waiting for Godot" 
sells even better in America than in France. The consciousness 
it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America, but it 
is the consciousness that most "mature" societies arrive at when 
their successes in technological and economic systematization propel 
them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture. 
America is now joining Europe in this "mature" phase of development. 
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens 
as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going 
on in the countries of Asia and Africa, and also of course on how long 
the cold war remains cold. 
Even Hemingway, for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality 
in <The Sun Also Rises> and <A Farewell to Arms> never 
maintained that sex was all. Hemingway's fiction is supported by a 
"moral" backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at 
a religious dimension. And D& H& Lawrence, in <Fantasia of the 
Unconscious,> protested vehemently against the overestimation of 
the sexual motive. Though sex in some form or other enters into all human 
activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect 
of human nature, it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of 
sex. "All is <not> sex", declared Lawrence. Man is not confined 
to one outlet for his vital energy. The creative urge, for example, 
transcends the body and the self.   But for the beat generation 
all <is> sex. Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary 
aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex. For 
the beatnik, like the hipster, is in opposition to a society that is based 
on the repression of the sex instinct. He has elevated sex- not 
Eros or libido but pure, spontaneous, uninhibited sex- to the rank 
of the godhead; it is Astarte, Ishtar, Venus, Yahwe, Dionysus, 
Christ, the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the 
body of the universe. Jazz is sex, marijuana is a stimulus to sex, the 
beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse. 
Lawrence Lipton, in <The Holy Barbarians,> stresses that for 
the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure; it is a 
mystique, and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities 
of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe 
of discourse. The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against 
the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in 
a public place. The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression 
of ungratified sexual desire. For this reason, too, their language 
is more forthright and earthy. The beatniks crave a sexual experience 
in which their whole being participates.   It is therefore not 
surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity, 
for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy. 
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy 
the precepts of legalized propriety. Unlike the heroes and flappers 
of the lost generation, they disdain the art of "necking" and "petting". 
That is reserved for the squares. If they avoid the use 
of the pungent, outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo; 
it is sacred. As Lipton, the prophet of the beat generation, declares: 
"In the sexual act, the beat are filled with mana, the divine 
power. This is far from the vulgar, leering sexuality of the middle-class 
square in heat". This is the Holy Grail these knights of 
the orgasm pursue, this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they 
respond.   If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out 
of the Egypt of sexual slavery, Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers 
them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence 
in liquor, marijuana, sex, and jazz. In addition, they have been converted 
to Zen Buddhism, with its glorification of all that is "natural" 
and mysteriously alive, the sense that everything in the world 
is flowing. Thus, paradoxically, the beat writers resort to "religious" 
metaphors: they are in search of mana, the spiritual, the numinous, 
but not anything connected with formal religion. What they are 
after is the beatific vision. And Zen Buddhism, though it is extremely 
difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled, 
helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through 
sexual release.   The style of life chosen by the beat generation, 
the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own, 
is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience. Jazz is 
good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided 
sexual effect. Jazz is the musical language of sex, the vocabulary of 
the orgasm; indeed, it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz, 
by freeing the listener of his inhibitions, can have therapeutic 
value. That is why, the argument runs, the squares are so fearful of 
jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it. Instead of giving themselves 
spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them, they 
undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes 
for satisfaction. Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy, the 
sacred road to integration of being. Jazz, like sex, is a mystique. It 
is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative 
impulse in unfettered man.   The mystique of sex, combined with 
marijuana and jazz, is intended to provide a design for living. Those 
who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free, their 
instincts put at the service of the imagination. Righteous in their 
denunciation of all that makes for death, the beat prophets bid all 
men become cool cats; let them learn to "swing" freely, to let 
go, to become authentically themselves, and then perhaps civilization 
will be saved. The beatnik, seceding from a society that is fatally 
afflicted with a deathward drive, is concerned with his personal salvation 
in the living present. If he is the child of nothingness, if he 
is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars, then he will consult 
only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil. He will not 
curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that 
makes him feel truly and fully alive, even if it is only for this brief 
moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.

That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the 
title of the holy barbarians; they will destroy the shrines, temples, 
museums, and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the 
life they believe in. Apart from the categorical imperative they derive 
from the metaphysics of the orgasm, the only affirmation they are 
capable of making is that art is their only refuge. Their writing, 
born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality, reflects 
the extremity of their existential alienation. The mind has betrayed 
them, reason is the foe of life; they will trust only their physical 
sensations, the wisdom of the body, the holy promptings of the unconscious. 
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate, but their 
faith in love, inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz, culminates 
in the climax of the orgasm. Their work mirrors the mentality 
of the psychopath, rootless and irresponsible. Their rebellion against 
authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt 
characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.   And the life they 
lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive, even though 
they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit- 
writing, painting, music. They are non-conformists on principle. When 
they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth, 
the rage of repudiation, the ecstasy of negation. It is sex that obsesses 
them, sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed. What 
they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can 
inspire the Muse. Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful 
middle class continue to suffer, whereas the beatnik has the courage 
to break out of that prison of respectability. One girl describes 
her past, her succession of broken marriages, the abortions she has 
had 
and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she 
must justify her passion. If it is an honest feeling, then why should 
she not yield to it? "<Most> often", she says, "it's the 
<monogamous> relationship that is <dis>honest". There is nothing 
holy in wedlock. This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist 
who disapproves of her life. She finds married life stifling and every 
prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.   This confession 
serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution: 
the craving for sensation for its own sake, the need for change, 
for new experiences. Boredom is death. In the realm of physical sensations, 
sex reigns supreme. Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on 
marijuana, jazz, free swinging poetry, exhausting themselves in orgies 
of sex; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and 
lose contact with reality. One beat poet composes a poem, "Lines on 
a Tijuana John", which contains a few happy hints for survival. 
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must 
move toward simplicity. The professed mission of this disaffiliated 
generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry 
and fiction, but what they produce is unfortunately disordered, nourished 
solely on the hysteria of negation.   Who are the creative 
representatives of this movement? Nymphomaniacs, junkies, homosexuals, 
drug addicts, lesbians, alcoholics, the weak, the frustrated, 
the irresolute, the despairing, the derelicts and outcasts of society. 
They embrace independent poverty, usually with a "shack-up" partner 
who will help support them. They are full of contempt for the institution 
of matrimony. Their previous legalized marriages do not count, 
for they hold the laws of the state null and void. They feel they 
are leagued against a hostile, persecutory world, faced with the concerted 
malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings, the police. 
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending 
their way of life, their search for wholeness, though their actual existence 
fails to reach these "religious" heights. One beatnik got 
the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and 
all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up. What 
obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk? Sex 
as the creative principle of the universe, the secret of primitive religion, 
the life of myth. Everything in the final analysis reduced itself 
to sexual symbolism. In his chapter on "The Loveways of the 
Beat Generation", Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details. 
No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West 
Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the 
group.   The women who come to West Venice, having forsaken radicalism, 
are interested in living only for the moment, in being constantly 
on the move. Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat 
generation are homosexuals, heroin addicts, and smalltime hoodlums. 
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks. 
Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana, they do not have to be 
initiated. Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana. As Lipton 
puts it: "The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana 
with far greater force, as a unifying principle in human relationships, 
than at any other time except, perhaps, in the mutual metaphysical 
orgasms. The magic circle is, in fact, a symbol of and preparation for 
the metaphysical orgasm". Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik 
comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense 
of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being. 
Carried high on this "charge", he composes "magical" poetry 
that captures the organic rhythms of life in words. If he thus achieves 
a lyrical, dreamlike, drugged intensity, he pays the price for his 
indulgence by producing work- Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" is 
a striking example of this tendency- that is disoriented, Dionysian 
but without depth and without Apollonian control. For drugs are in 
themselves no royal road to creativity. How is the beat poet to achieve 
unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic 
derangement of senses.   If love reflects the nature of man, as 
Ortega y Gasset believes, if the person in love betrays decisively what 
he is by his behavior in love, then the writers of the beat generation 
are creating a new literary genre. 
_@_ There were fences in the old days when we were children. Across 
the front of a yard and down the side, they were iron, either spiked 
along the top or arched in half circles. Alley fences were made 
of solid boards higher than one's head, but not so high as the golden 
glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them. 
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses; front 
fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle. 
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of 
cast-iron foliage; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail: 
high-pitched roof, pinnacle, and narrow gable. On these posts 
the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang.

The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences 
was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree. The primary 
quality of that view seems, now, to have been its quietness, but that 
cannot at the time have impressed us. What one actually remembers 
is its greenness. From high in the tree, the whole block lay within 
range of the eye, but the ground was almost nowhere visible. One looked 
down on a sea of leaves, a breaking wave of flower. Every path from 
back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor, and every yard had its 
fruit trees. In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers 
had planted syringa and sweet-shrub, snowball, rose-of-Sharon and 
balm-of-Gilead. From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse 
of life on the floor of this green sea: a neighbor's gingham 
skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor, 
or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter 
of garments hung there, half-way down the block.   That was one 
epoch: the apple-tree epoch. Another had ended before it began. Time 
is a queer thing and memory a queerer; the tricks that time plays 
with memory and memory with time are queerest of all. From maturity 
one looks back at the succession of years, counts them and makes them 
many, yet cannot feel <length> in the number, however large. In a 
stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond 
is quiet, its surface dark and shadowed, and there does not seem to 
be much water in it. Time in the sum is nothing. And yet- a year to 
a child is an eternity, and in the memory that phase of one's being- 
a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning 
and without end. The part of the mind that preserves dates and 
events may remonstrate, "It could have been like that for only a 
little while"; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds 
fast to things that were and they are outside of time.   Once, 
then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was 
bound round by fences, when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough, 
to twist my knee over it and pull myself up. That world was in 
scale with my own smallness. I have no picture in my mind of the garden 
as a whole- that I could not see- but certain aspects of certain 
corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums 
beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their 
sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned 
over by a dusty-slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked 
in the ragged, brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner 
between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on 
our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother 
for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.   It was 
mother who planted the verbenas. I think that my grandmother was not 
an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and 
grandchildren. My great-grandmother, I have been told, made her garden 
her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders 
in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to 
be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with 
common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed, 
and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house. These my 
grandmother left in their places (they are still there, more persistent 
and longer-lived than the generations of man) and planted others like 
them, that flourished without careful tending. Three of these only 
were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses, whose petals 
might not be collected until they had fallen, to be made into perfume 
or rose-tea to drink; the peonies, whose tight sticky buds would 
be blighted by the laying on of a finger, although they were not apparently 
harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies. I 
have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer 
morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than 
my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap, unfolded, and shook out 
like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals. Other flowers 
we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath 
the lilacs; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so prodigally but 
for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms 
that, 
turned upside down, make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little, 
dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.   More 
potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a 
few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae 
which are of the very stuff of the mind, intrinsic, because they 
were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that 
held them. Flowers, stones, and small creatures, living and dead. Pale 
yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods 
of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow 
columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and 
eaten 
for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped 
and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers 
from the trumpet vine that made "gloves" on the ends of ten 
waggling fingers. Fuzzy caterpillars, snails with their sensitive horns, 
struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded 
to "spit tobacco, spit". Dead fledgling birds, their squashed-looking 
nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they 
had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags. And 
the 
cast shell of a locust, straw-colored and transparent, weighing nothing, 
fragile but entire, with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down 
its back. Every morning early, in the summer, we searched the trunks 
of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells, carefully 
detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung, and stabled 
them, a weird faery herd, in an angle between the high roots of the 
tulip tree, where no grass grew in the dense shade **h. We collected 
"lucky stones"- all the creamy translucent pebbles, worn smooth 
and round, that we could find in the driveway. When these had been 
pocketed, we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles 
for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their 
dull exteriors indicated. We showed them to each other and said "Would 
you have guessed **h"? Squatting on our haunches beside the 
flat stone we broke them on, we were safe behind the high closed gates 
at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation 
and possible amusement of the passers-by. Thus shielded, we played 
many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the 
fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post 
was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let 
down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire, even then we paid 
little heed to those who went by on the path outside.   We enjoyed 
a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school. In 
the heat of the summer, the garden solitudes were ours alone; our 
elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch. They 
never troubled themselves about us while we were playing, because 
the fence formed such a definite boundary and "Don't go outside 
the gate" was a command so impossible of misinterpretation. We were 
not, however, entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street. 
We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they sag on their 
hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but we could stand on them, when they 
were latched, rest our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing 
to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that lay before 
our eyes.   The street that is full now of traffic and parked 
cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade 
of the curbside trees, and silence was a weight, almost palpable, 
in the air. Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell 
away again, crushed beneath it. A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter, 
the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees, and loose 
straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves. A wheel squeaked 
on a hub, was still, and squeaked again. If a child watched its progress 
he whispered, "Hay, hay, load of hay- make a wish and turn 
away", and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the 
sound of the horses' feet returned no more. When the hay wagon had 
gone, and an interval passed, a huckster's cart might turn the corner. 
The horse walked, the reins were slack, the huckster rode with bowed 
shoulders, his forearms across his knees. Sleepily, as if half-reluctant 
to break the silence, he lifted his voice: "Rhu-beb-ni-ice 
fresh rhu-<beb> today"! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time 
like the drone of a bumble-bee. No one seemed to hear him, no one heeded. 
The horse plodded on, and he repeated his call. It became so monotonous 
as to seem a part of the quietness. After his passage, the street 
was empty again. The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down; 
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk, from sidewalk 
to lawn. At four-o'clock, or four-thirty, the coming of the newsboy 
marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front 
door, and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read 
what their neighbors had been doing.   The streets of any county 
town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were 
like this fifty-odd years ago, and yesterday. But the fences were still 
in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we stood on the gate to look 
over, the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving 
stones with grass between and on both sides. The curb was a line 
of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost 
in the ground or the roots of trees. Opposite every gate was a hitching 
post or a stone carriage-step, set with a rusty iron ring for tying 
a horse. The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center; 
it was mud in wet weather and dust, ankle-deep, in dry, and could 
be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones. It had 
a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since. The hoofmarks of 
cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as 
numerous as the traces of shod horses. Cows were kept in backyard barns, 
boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge 
of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys' 
coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.

It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story, 
because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and 
makes of them a curious, riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant 
for Mann's work.   The wife, Amra, and her lover are 
both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, "voluptuous" 
and "indolent", possibly "a mischief maker", with "a kind 
of luxurious cunning" to set against her apparent simplicity, her "birdlike 
brain". La^utner, for his part, "belonged to the present-day 
race of small artists, who do not demand the utmost of themselves", 
and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets 
as "wretched little poseurs", the devastating indictment "they 
do not know how to be wretched decently and in order", and the somewhat 
extreme prophecy, so far not fulfilled: "They will be destroyed".

The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want 
not simply of decency but of imagination as well. His appearance as 
Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle 
absolutely painful, an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed 
by spirit, untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation. 
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat 
man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches 
for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's, 
upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human 
life.   The music which La^utner has composed for this episode 
is for the most part "rather pretty and perfectly banal". But 
it is characteristic of him, we are told, "his little artifice", 
to be able to introduce "into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of 
hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art". And this occurs 
now, at the refrain of Jacoby's song- at the point, in fact, of 
the name "Lizzy"-; a modulation described as "almost a stroke 
of genius". "A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly 
torn away to reveal something nude". It is this modulation 
which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously, 
his wife's infidelity. By the same means he perceives this fact 
as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses, and dies.

In the work of every artist, I suppose, there may be found 
one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive, 
ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly 
so for being mysterious, as though some deeply hidden constatation of 
thoughts were enciphered in a single image, a single moment. So here. 
The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke 
gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore 
dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the 
bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, 
mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional 
touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack 
the problem of suffering"); the miraculous way in which music, revelation 
and death are associated in a single instant- all this seems 
a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, 
also, 
it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's 
work.   When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that 
this passage is of critical significance, I come up with the following 
ideas, which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in 
a later essay.   Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's 
heroes. The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically 
turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled 
and forbidden to love. The release, the freedom, involved in loving 
another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible; 
and the motion toward it brings disaster.   This prohibition 
on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly 
the artist (Tonio Kro^ger, Aschenbach, Leverku^hn) who suffers 
from it. The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem 
of the "breakthrough" in the realm of art.   Again, the sufferings 
and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment 
not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another 
with childhood, with the figure of a child.   Finally, the 
theatrical (and perversely erotic) notions of dressing up, cosmetics, 
disguise, and especially change of costume (or singularity of costume, 
as with Cipolla), are characteristically associated with the catastrophes 
of Mann's stories.   We shall return to these statements 
and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates. 
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of 
Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all these elements come together 
in prophetic parody. Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated 
with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially 
middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself 
dressed up, disguised- that is, paradoxically, revealed- as a 
child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child. That this abandonment 
takes place on a stage, during an 'artistic' performance, 
is enough to associate Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the 
punishment for art; that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable, as 
is anyone in Mann's stories who produces <illusion>, and this is 
true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature, technique, 
magic, guilt and suffering, are divided in this story between Jacoby 
and La^utner.   It appears that the dominant tendency of 
Mann's early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque the surface, 
is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic, the expressionistic. 
In a certain perfectly definite way, the method and the theme of his 
stories are one and the same.   Something of this can be learned 
from "The Way to the Churchyard" (1901), an anecdote about 
an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die 
of a stroke or seizure. There is no more "plot" than that; only 
slightly more, perhaps, than a newspaper account of such an incident 
would give. The artistic interest, then, lies in what the encounter 
may be made to represent, in the power of some central significance 
to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.   The first 
sentence, with its platitudinous irony, announces an emblematic intent: 
"The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad, ran 
beside it all the way to the end; that is to say, to the churchyard". 
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction. 
The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while 
the way to the churchyard belongs to death. But that is too simple, 
and won't hold up. As the first sentence suggests, both roads belong 
to death in the end. But the highroad, according to the description 
of its traffic, belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death, 
while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life: 
a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in the awareness 
of death. Thus, on the highroad, a troop of soldiers "marched in their 
own dust and sang", while on the footpath one man walks alone.

This man's isolation is not merely momentary, it is permanent. 
He is a widower, his three children are dead, he has no one left on 
earth; also he is a drunk, and has lost his job on that account. His 
name is Praisegod Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to 
his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister 
type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic 
strangers in "Death in Venice", for example, who represent 
some combination of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.   This strange 
person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path 
rather than the highroad. The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace 
young fellow, is not named but identified simply as "Life"- that 
and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him. "Life" 
points out that "everybody uses this path", and starts to ride 
on. Piepsam tries to stop him by force, receives a push in the chest 
from "Life", and is left standing in impotent and growing rage, 
while a crowd begins to gather. His rage assumes a religious form; 
that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness, 
Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God 
imprecates doom on Life- not only the cyclist now, but the audience, 
the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed". This passion 
brings on a fit which proves fatal. Then an ambulance comes along, 
and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away.   This is simple enough, 
but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant. The 
season, between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree 
aspect. Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because <he> cannot 
stop the cyclist, but also because God will not stop him; as Piepsam 
says to the crowd in his last moments: "His justice is not of 
this world".   Life is further characterized, in antithesis to 
Piepsam, as animal: the image of a dog, which appears at several 
places, is first given as the criterion of amiable, irrelevant interest 
aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon 
is "admirable", "a pleasure to contemplate"; another wagon 
has no dog, and therefore is "devoid of interest". Piepsam calls 
the cyclist "cur" and "puppy" among other things, and at the crisis 
of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into 
his face. The ambulance is drawn by two "charming" little horses.

Piepsam is not, certainly, religious in any conventional sense. 
His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically, connected with 
his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical. His unsuccessful 
strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings; 
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home, and "before this wardrobe Praisegod 
Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees, and in 
his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated".

The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is simply 
unreflective, unproblematic Life, "blithe and carefree". "He 
made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth".

Piepsam is grotesque, a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous 
and trivial. He is "a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard". 
But he is more interesting than the others, the ones who come from 
the highroad to watch him, more interesting than Life considered 
as a cyclist. And if I have gone into so much detail about so small 
a work, that is because it is also so typical a work, representing the 
germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing: 
the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical, destructive 
and self-destructive tendencies, much that is enlarged and illuminated 
in the figures of, for instance, Naphta and Leverku^hn.

In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details 
selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for "realism", 
anticipates a kind of musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional 
composition, in which, as Leverku^hn says, "there shall be 
nothing unthematic". It resembles, too, pictures such as Du^rer 
and Bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial 
proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a 
proverb, for example, or a deadly sin.   "Gladius Dei" (1902) 
resembles "The Way to the Churchyard" in its representation 
of a conflict between light and dark, between "Life" and a spirit 
of criticism, negation, melancholy, but it goes considerably further 
in characterizing the elements of this conflict.   The monk Savonarola, 
brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background 
of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious 
works displayed in the art-shop of M& Bluthenzweig; in 
particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, 
according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress. Hieronymus, 
like Piepsam, makes his protest quite in vain, and his rejection, though 
not fatal, is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out 
of the shop by the porter. On the street outside, Hieronymus envisions 
a holocaust of the vanities of this world, such a burning of artistic 
and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in 
Florence, and prophetically he issues his curse: "<Gladius Dei 
super terram cito et velociter>". 
The "reality" to which they respond is rationally empty and their 
art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and 
empty world. Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.

These polar concerns (imitation vs& formalism) reflect 
a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing 
over a long period of time. The breakdown of classical structures of 
meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations 
of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes. 
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal 
and spiritual qualities, and complete objectification in sub-human and 
quasi-mechanistic powers. The image of the world tends to reflect the 
hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces 
and overwhelming mystery. The image of God has simply disappeared. 
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory 
response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism: 
if man can neither know nor love reality as it is, he can at 
least invent an artistic "reality" which is its own world and which 
can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable 
of being known and worthy of being loved. The person of the artist 
becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by 
the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical 
systems.   Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and 
whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding 
the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually 
exclusive, that they belong together. Without the decay of a 
sense of objective reference (except as the imitation of mystery), the 
stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into 
being. And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves 
insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art, their peculiar 
authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously 
and gives promise that from their very substance, new and valid 
chapters in the philosophy of art may be written. For better or worse 
we cannot regard "imitation" in the arts in the simple mode of 
classical rationalism or detached realism. A broader concept of imitation 
is needed, one which acknowledges that true invention is important, 
that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic 
causal factors out of which it arises. On the other hand, we cannot regard 
artistic invention as pure, uncaused, and unrelated to the times 
in which it occurs. We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from 
the solipsism and futility of pure formalism. Accordingly, it is the 
aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation (which I shall 
call <mimesis> in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of 
imitation) and a new theory of invention (which I shall call <symbol> 
for reasons to be stated hereafter). 

#THE MIMETIC IMAGINATION IN 
THE ARTS#

The word "mimesis" ("imitation") is usually associated 
with Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, "imitation" is twice 
removed from reality, being a poor copy of physical appearance, which 
in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence. All artistic and mythological 
representations, therefore, are "imitations of imitations" and 
are completely superseded by the truth value of "dialectic", the 
proper use of the inquiring intellect. In Plato's judgment, the 
arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young, 
prior to the full development of their intellectual powers. Presupposed 
in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which 
a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating 
to the most sublime wisdom. Aristotle also tended to stratify all 
aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and, 
like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level. 
The <Poetics>, in affirming that all human arts are "modes 
of imitation", gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than 
did Plato. But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented 
it by describing in the <Poetics> what kinds of character and 
action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and 
important human truths. For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis, 
in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of 
expressing the character of fundamental reality.   The central 
concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called <Mimesis> 
is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation (based upon 
a recognition of levels of truth) to a Christian theory of imitation 
in which the levels are dissolved. Following the theme of Incarnation 
in the Gospels, the Christian artist and critic sees in the most 
commonplace and ordinary events "figures" of divine power and reality. 
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation 
in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent. 
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement 
of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama. The artist, unlike 
the philosopher, is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified 
high levels of abstraction. He is the conveyor of a sacred reality 
by which he has been grasped. I have chosen to use the word "mimesis" 
in its Christian rather than its classic implications and 
to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological 
expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the direct consequence 
of involvement in historical experience, which are not reserved, 
as in the Greek mind, only to moments of theoretical reflection.

In the first instance, "mimesis" is here used to mean the 
recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms 
of abstract ideas or conventional designations. By "image" is meant 
not only a visual presentation, but also remembered sensations of any 
of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined 
therewith. This is the primary function of the imagination operating 
in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images 
were first appropriated. Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to 
the actual re-living of experience, in which the imagining person recovers 
through images something of the force and depth characteristic 
of experience itself. The images themselves, like their counterparts 
in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately; 
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities 
and a unique relatedness to one another. They bring an inextricable 
component of value within themselves, with attractions and repulsions 
native to their own quality. As in experience one is seized by 
given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in 
value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation 
of images. Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism 
or realism in the conventional sense. A word taken in its dictionary 
meaning, a photographic image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing 
of a "scene" tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote 
such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without 
the incitement of value feelings. Similarly experience itself can 
be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues 
for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential 
field. A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection 
to a sense of immediacy.   The mimetic character of the 
imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation 
of artistic forms and materials. When words can be used in a more fresh 
and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and 
sounds, when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape 
all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of 
themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude of attention, all 
this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes 
upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance. These 
are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self 
and thrusts the self into decision and choice. The presence of genuine 
mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work 
demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely 
understood.   Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain 
presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which 
require some exposition before the main argument can proceed. Experience 
is not seen, as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting 
us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space 
and 
registering their character, movements, and changes on the <tabula 
rasa> of an uninvolved intellect. Neither is primary experience understood 
according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing 
is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing 
their responses in the appropriate sense organs. Primary feelings 
of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects 
(houses, trees, implements, etc&) nor a collection of isolated and 
neutral sensory qualities. In contrast to all this, primary data are 
data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.   The 
most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings, both positive 
and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment 
into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other 
part. These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers 
in which one is involved, some working for one's good, others threatening 
ill. Gone is the <tabula rasa> of the mind. In its place 
is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive 
or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined 
by constellations of process in which one is caught.   The principal 
defender of this view of primary experience as "causal efficacy" 
is Alfred North Whitehead. Our most elemental and unavoidable 
impressions, he says, are those of being involved in a large arena of 
powers which have a longer past than our own, which are interrelated 
in a vast movement through the present toward the future. We feel the 
quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening. 
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors 
of judgment in these apprehensions of value, but the apprehensions themselves 
are the primary stuff of experience. It takes a great deal 
of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger 
unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a 
collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern, 
devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far 
as they present themselves for inspection. Whitehead is here questioning 
David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he 
is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's 
presupposition 
that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from 
causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually 
imputed to the world, not directly perceived. What Hume calls "sensation" 
is what Whitehead calls "perception in the mode of presentational 
immediacy" which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception 
in the mode of causal efficacy. As long as perception is seen as 
composed only of isolated sense data, most of the quality and interconnectedness 
of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention 
of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical scepticism. Whitehead 
contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity 
of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other 
and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because 
the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and 
tendency to mistake the detail, is initially <given> in the way man 
feels the world. In this respect experience is broader and full of 
a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of 
his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct. 
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is 
one of derivation from the past. Both I and my feelings come up out 
of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are 
ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am. 
After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications 
of melioration, though "in a slight degree", to be sure.

There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century. I leave 
it to the statisticians to say what they were, but I noticed several 
a few years ago, during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg. 
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school 
and the White school, and in every instance the former made a better 
appearance (it was newer, for one thing). It really looked as if a 
change of the sort predicted by Booker T& Washington had been going 
on. But with the renewal of interference in 1954 (as with its beginning 
in 1835), the improvement was impaired.   For over a hundred 
years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them. 
It's infuriating, this feeling that one is being picked on, continually, 
constantly. By what right of superior virtue, Southerners ask, 
do the people of the North do this? The traditional strategy of the 
South has been to expose the vices of the North, to demonstrate that 
the North possessed no superior virtue, to "show the world that" 
(as James's Christopher Newman said to <his> adversaries) "however 
bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it".

In the pre-Civil War years, the South argued that the slave was 
not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North. At 
the present time, the counter-attack takes the line that there's no 
more of the true <spirit> of "integration" in the North than 
in the South. The line is a pretty good one.   People talk about 
"the law of the land". The expression has become quite a cliche. 
But people can't be made to integrate, socialize (the two are inseparable 
by Southern standards) by law.   I was having lunch not 
long ago (apologies to N& V& Peale) with three distinguished 
historians (one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American 
history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them if they 
could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed 
with "deliberate speed, majestic instancy" (Francis Thompson's 
words for the Hound of <Heaven's> pursuit) by judicial fiat. 
They didn't seem to be able to think of any.   A Virginia 
judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years 
might be a reasonable length of time for such a change. But I suspect 
that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation- 
the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he 
said, "They make a desert, and call it peace" ("Solitudinem faciunt, 
pacem appellant".).

Moreover, the law of the land is not 
irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been, many times. Mr& 
Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the 
North, and soon became a dead letter. Prohibition was the law of the 
land, but it was unpopular (how many of us oldsters took up drinking 
in prohibition days, drinking was so gay, so fashionable, especially 
in the sophisticated Northeast!) and was repealed. The cliche loses 
its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.   The 
Declaration of Independence says that "governments derive their 
just powers from the consent of the governed". The phrase "consent 
of the governed" needs a hard look. How do we define it? Is the 
consent of the governed a numerical majority? Calhoun dealt with 
this question in his "Disquisition on Government".   To guard 
against the tyranny of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his 
theory of "concurrent majority", which, he said, "by giving to 
each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the 
action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial 
or local legislation". Who will say that our country is even now a 
homogeneous community? that regional peculiarities do not still exist? 
that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region? 
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal 
action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of "the consent 
of the governed"?   Circumstances alter cases. A friend 
of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular 
trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell. He 
seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular 
trouble anywhere. I murmured something about a possible difference between 
New Mexico's history and Mississippi's.   One can meet 
with aloofness almost anywhere: the Thank-Heaven-We're-not-Involved 
viewpoint, It Doesn't Affect Us! Southern Liberals 
(there are a good many)- especially if they're rich- often exhibit 
blithe insouciance. The trouble here is that it's almost too easy 
to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything. 
You've already sent your daughter to Miss ~X's select academy 
for girls and your son to Mr& ~Y's select academy for boys, and 
you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity. If there's 
no suitable academy in your own neighborhood, there's always New 
England. New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces, 
South as well as West. They may even enroll a colored student 
or two for show, though he usually turns out to be from Thailand, or 
any place other than the American South. It would be interesting to 
know how much "integration" there is in the famous, fashionable colleges 
and prep schools of New England. A recent newspaper report 
said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one 
thousand at Yale; that is, about one-half of one per cent, which 
looks pretty "tokenish" to me, especially in an institution which 
professes to be "national".   I must confess that I prefer 
the Liberal who is personally affected, who is willing to send his own 
children to a mixed school as proof of his faith. I leave out of account 
the question of the best interests of the children, the question 
of what their best interests really are. I'm talking about the grand 
manner of the Liberal- North <and> South- who is not affected 
personally. If these people were denied a voice (do they have a 
moral right to a voice?), what voices would be left? Who is involved 
<willy nilly?> Well, after everybody has followed the New England 
pattern of segregating one's children into private schools, 
only the poor folks are left. And it is precisely in this poorer economic 
class that one finds, and has always found, the most racial friction. 
##

A dear, respected friend of mine, who like myself grew up 
in the South and has spent many years in New England, said to me 
not long ago: "I can't forgive New England for rejecting 
all complicity". Being a teacher of American literature, I remembered 
Whittier's "Massachusetts to Virginia", where he said: 
"But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone, 
And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown". There 
is a legend (Hawthorne records it in his "English Notebooks". and 
one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page) to the effect that the 
<Mayflower> 
on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves. Whether 
historically a fact or not, the legend has a certain symbolic value.

<Complicity> is an embarrassing word. It is something 
which most of us try to get out from under. Like the cowboy in Stephen 
Crane's "Blue Hotel", we run around crying, "Well, I 
didn't do anything, did I"? Robert Penn Warren puts it this 
way in "Brother to Dragons": "The recognition of complicity 
is the beginning of innocence", where innocence, I think, means 
about the same thing as redemption. A man must be able to say, "Father, 
I have sinned", 
or there is no hope for him. Lincoln understood 
this better than most when he said in his "Second Inaugural" 
that God "gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the 
woe due to those by whom the offense came". He also spoke of "the 
wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited 
toil". Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that 
a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of 
the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade. After 
how many generations is such wealth (mounting all the while through 
the manipulations of high finance) purified of taint? It is a question 
which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds. But didn't 
they get off too easy? The slaves never shared in <their> profits, 
while they did share, in a very real sense, in the profits of the 
slave-owners: they were fed, clothed, doctored, and so forth; they 
were the beneficiaries of responsible, paternalistic care. 
Emerson- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire- sounded a high Transcendental 
note in his "Boston Hymn", delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music 
Hall amidst thundering applause: "Pay ransom to the owner and 
fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is owner, 
And ever was. Pay him"! It is the abstractionism, the unrealism, 
of the pure idealist. It ignores the sordid financial aspects (quite 
conveniently, too, for his audience, who could indulge in moral indignation 
without visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money 
from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic 
brokerage). Like Pilate, they had washed their hands. But can one, 
really? Can God be mocked, ever, in the long run?   New 
Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in 
Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, 
as Jefferson explained in his "Autobiography": "

The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa 
was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who 
had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on 
the contrary still wished to continue it. Our Northern brethren also 
I believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their 
people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable 
carriers of them to others".   But that was a long 
time ago. The New England conscience became desensitized. George 
W& Cable (naturalized New Englander), writing in 1889 from "Paradise 
Road, Northampton" (lovely symbolic name), agitated continuously 
the "<Southern> question". It was nice to be able to isolate 
it. ##

New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster 
to the Nation. There one finds concentrated in a comparatively 
small area the chief universities, colleges, and preparatory schools 
of the United States. Why should this be so? It is true that New 
England, more than any other section, was dedicated to education 
from the start. But I think that something more than this is involved.

How did it happen, for example, that the state university, 
that great symbol of American democracy, failed to flourish in New England 
as it did in other parts of the country? Isn't it a bit odd 
that the three states of Southern New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
and Rhode Island) have had state institutions of university 
status only in the very recent past, these institutions having previously 
been ~A+~M colleges? Was it supposed, perchance, that 
~A+~M (vocational training, that is) was quite sufficient for the 
immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in 
the post-Civil War period, the immigrants having been brought in from 
Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for the labor 
shortage caused by migration to the West? Is it not ironical that 
Roger Williams's state, Rhode Island, should have been the very 
last of the forty-eight to establish a state university? The state 
universities of Maine, New Hampshire, And Vermont are older and more 
"respectable"; they had less immigration to contend with.

A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in <The Yale Review>, 
said: "We in New England have long since segregated our children". 
He was referring not only to the general college situation 
but more especially to the preparatory schools. And what a galaxy of 
those adorns that fair land! I don't propose to go into their history, 
but I have one or two surmises. One is that they were established, 
or gained eminence, under pressure provided by these same immigrants, 
from whom the old families wished to segregate their children. 
In the early days of a homogeneous population, the public school was 
quite satisfactory.

AMONG THE RECIPIENTS of the Nobel Prize for Literature 
more than half are practically unknown to readers of English. Of these 
there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than 
Verner von Heidenstam, the Swedish poet and novelist who received 
the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago. 
Equally a master of prose and verse, he recreates the glory of Sweden 
in the past and continues it into the present. In the following sketch 
we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as 
possible speak for himself.   Heidenstam was born in 1859, of 
a prosperous family. On his father's side he was of German descent, 
on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility. The family 
estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Va^ttern in south central 
Sweden. It is a lonely, rather desolate region, but full of legendary 
and historic associations. As a boy in a local school he was shy 
and solitary, absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of 
Sweden's ancient glory. He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain 
and to dress for the part. Being somewhat delicate in health, at the 
age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once 
developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten 
years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, 
and Palestine. In one of his summers at home he married, to the 
great disapproval of his father, who objected because of his extreme youth.

Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio of Gerome 
in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the artists, but soon found 
that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction. 
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem, "The 
Happy Artists". "I scanned the world through printed symbol 
swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man. 
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart". 
In this final line, we have the key to his nature. Few writers 
have better understood their deepest selves. Heidenstam could never be 
satisfied by surface. It may, however, be noted that his gift for color 
and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.

The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was 
a volume of poems, <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years (Vallfart och vandringsar),> 
published in 1888. It was a brilliant debut, so much so 
indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's 
<Childe Harold>. Professor Fredrik Bo^o^k, Sweden's 
foremost critic of the period, acclaims it as follows: "In 
this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful, plastic, racy, 
vivid. In a bold, sometimes careless, form there is nothing academic; 
all is seen and felt and experienced, the observation is sharp 
and the imagination lively. The young poet-painter reproduces the French 
life of the streets; he tells stories of the Thousand and One 
Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus. In the 
care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the 
old happy existence, and for that reason he loves it. And yet amid all 
the gay hedonism in <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years> is a cycle of 
short poems, "Thoughts in Loneliness", filled with brooding, melancholy, 
and sombre longing".   Of the longer pieces of the volume 
none is so memorable as "Nameless and Immortal", which at 
once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language. 
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of 
Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian 
classic style now in existence. On the eve of his return to their 
native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises 
before them in its completed perfection. The supreme object of their 
lives is now fulfilled, says the wife, her husband has achieved immortality. 
Not so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple 
that is immortal. "The man's true reputation is his work".

The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as "Thoughts 
in Loneliness" is, as Professor Bo^o^k indicated, in sharp contrast 
with the others. It consists of fragmentary personal revelations, 
such as "The Spark": "There is a spark dwells deep within 
my soul. To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's 
aim both first and last, the whole. It slips away, it burns and tortures 
me. That little spark is all the wealth I know, That little spark 
is my life's misery". A dominant motive is the poet's longing 
for his homeland and its boyhood associations: "Not men-folk, but 
the fields where I would stray, The stones where as a child I used 
to play". He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory 
life he has been leading. What he really wants is to find "a 
sacred cause" to which he can honestly devote himself. This restless 
individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all 
the rest of his life in Sweden. His cause was to commemorate the glory 
of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.

He did not, however, find himself at once. His next major 
work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic epic in prose, entitled 
<Hans Alienus,> which Professor Bo^o^k describes as a monument 
on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth. The hero, who is 
himself, is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East, 
a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from Professor Bo^o^k again, 
"even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from 
his painful search after the meaning of life. He is driven back by 
his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of 
Tiveden".   From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his 
deeper self. By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession 
of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions. He 
did not, however, settle back into acquiescence with things as they were. 
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little 
patience with collective mediocrity. He saw Sweden as a country of 
smug and narrow provincialism, indifferent to the heroic spirit of its 
former glory. Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear 
down the old structures and build anew from the ground up. Heidenstam's 
conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories 
of the past. ##

Whether in prose or poetry, all of Heidenstam's 
later work was concerned with Sweden. With the first of a group 
of historical novels, <The Charles Men (Karolinerna)>, published 
in 1897-8, he achieved the masterpiece of his career. In scope 
and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's <War and Peace>. 
About one-third as long, it is less intimate and detailed, but better 
coordinated, more concise and more dramatic. Though it centers around 
the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles /12,, the true hero 
is not finally the king himself. Hence the title of the book, referring 
to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield 
of Poltava, to quote from the novel, "the wreath he twined for 
himself slipped down upon his people".   <The Charles Men> 
consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories, 
each depicting a special phase of the general subject. Somewhat uneven 
in interest for an average reader, eight or ten of these are among 
the finest of their kind in literature. They comprise a great variety 
of scene and interest: grim episodes of war, idyllic interludes, superb 
canvases of world-shaking events, and delightfully humorous sketches 
of odd characters. The general effect is tragic. Almost nothing 
is said of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme being 
the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune 
and defeat.   To carry out this exalted conception the 
author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed 
in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale. His 
peculiar gift, as had been suggested before, is his intensity. George 
Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style. Of few authors 
is this more true than of Heidenstam. <The Charles Men> has a tremendous 
range of characters, of common folk even more than of major 
figures. The career of Charles /12, is obviously very similar to that 
of Napoleon. His ideal was Alexander of Macedon, as Napoleon's 
was Julius Caesar. His purpose, however, was not to establish an 
empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice. Each aspired 
to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god. 
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought 
ruin on the country that worshipped him. Each is still glorified 
as a national hero.   The first half of <The Charles Men,> 
ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709, is more dramatically 
coherent than the second. After the collapse of that desperate 
and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a 
time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous. 
Like Napoleon, he was the worst of losers. There are, however, some 
wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part, concerning 
the reactions of the Swedes in adversity. Then more than ever before 
did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness. This comes 
out in "When the Bells Ring", which describes the rallying of the 
peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.

In "The King's Ride", Charles breaks out of a long period 
of petulance and inertia, regains his old self, escapes from Turkey, 
and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years. 
He finds it in utter misery and desolation. All his people ask for 
is no more war. But he plunges into yet another, this time with Norway, 
and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall, being 
only thirty-six years of age when he died. He had become king at fifteen.

Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular 
feeling. From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol 
of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden. This is 
brought out in the next to last chapter of the book, "A Hero's 
Funeral", written in the form of an impassioned prose poem. Slowly 
the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside 
the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral, the shrine 
of so many precious memories. The guns are fired, the hymns are 
sung, and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside 
the tombs of his ancestors. As he had longed to be, he became the 
echo of a saga.   Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction 
about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory. Excellent in their 
way, they lack the wide appeal of <The Charles Men>, and need 
not detain us here. It is different with his volume <The Swedes 
and Their Chieftains (Svenskarna och deras ho^vdingar),> a history 
intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high 
school students. Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to Swedish 
history for readers of other countries. Some of the earlier episodes 
have touches of the supernatural, as suited to the legendary background. 
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlo^f. Especially touching 
is the chapter, "The Little Sister", about a king's daughter 
who became a nun in the convent of St& Birgitta. The record 
teems with romance and adventure. Gustaf Vasa is a superb example, 
and Charles /10,, the conqueror of Denmark, hardly less so. Of 
Gustavus Adolphus and Charles /12, it is unnecessary to speak. 
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or 
handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always 
been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with 
those who have not. It is from this unpromising background that the 
fictional private detective was recruited. ##

THE mythological 
private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential 
ways. On the one hand, he does not work for a large agency, but 
is almost always self-employed. As a free-lance investigator, the fictional 
detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client. 
For this reason, he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure, 
whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 
9 to 5 routine. On the other hand, the fictional detective does not 
break strikes or handle divorce cases; no client would ever think of 
asking him to do such things. Whatever his original assignment, the 
fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime, usually 
a murder. Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in 
name, he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police 
themselves. He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to 
do so (frequently he does not receive a fee at all), but because he enjoys 
his work, because he firmly believes that murder must be punished. 
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman. 
He is, first and foremost, a defender of public morals, a servant of 
society.   It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and 
public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological 
detective. By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and 
his freedom from external restraint, the private eye is a perfect embodiment 
of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing 
what you please and let the devil take the hindmost. At the same time, 
because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal 
dictates of his society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is 
in middle class eyes a virtuous man. In this way, the private detective 
gets the best of two possible worlds. He is an individualist but 
not an anarchist; he is a public servant but not a cop. In short, the 
fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's 
ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere 
promote the public welfare. In the mystery story, as in <The 
Wealth of Nations,> individualism and the social good are two sides 
of the same benevolent coin. ##

THERE is only one 
catch to this idyllic arrangement: Adam Smith was wrong. Not only 
did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest 
number, he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to monopoly 
capitalism. The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe 
and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900. Now, although 
the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far 
as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades 
of the 19th century that the private detective became an established 
figure in popular fiction. Sherlock Holmes, the ancestor of all private 
eyes, was born during the 1890s. Thus the transformation of Adam 
Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides 
closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life. Driven 
from the marketplace by the course of history, our hero disguises 
himself as a private detective. The birth of the myth compensates 
for the death of the ideal.   Even on the fictional level, however, 
the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully 
resolved. The individualism and public service of the private detective 
both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct: 
he enforces the law without being told to do so. The private eye is therefore 
a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society. 
The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between 
good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal. 
Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold good. As 
capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon 
force and violence for its survival, the private detective is placed 
in a serious dilemma. If he is good, he may not be legal; if he is 
legal, he may not be good. It is the gradual unfolding and deepening 
of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution 
of the mystery story. ##

WITH the advent of Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the development of the modern private 
detective begins. Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist; 
he is very close to being a mental case. A brief list of the great 
detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr& Freud with 
ample food for thought. Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and 
other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances 
induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse, an incredible 
egotist, a confirmed misogynist. Holmes rebels against the social 
conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds. His 
eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom. It was in order 
to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became 
a detective in the first place. As he informs Watson, "My life is 
spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. 
These little problems help me to do so". Holmes is a public servant, 
to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.

The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard 
provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric 
behavior. Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland 
Yard, Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality 
of the police. They for their part are convinced that Holmes 
is too "unorthodox" and "theoretical" to make a good detective. 
Why do the police find Holmes "unorthodox"? On the face of 
it, it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official 
police routine. Another, more interesting explanation, is hinted at by 
Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have 
made a magnificent criminal. The great detective modestly agrees. Watson's 
insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes 
and his arch-opponent, Dr& Moriarty. The two men resemble each other 
closely in their cunning, their egotism, their relentlessness. The 
first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty 
grappling together on the edge of a cliff. They are presumed 
to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace. Linked to Holmes 
even in death, Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great 
detective, the image of what our hero might have become were he not a 
public servant. Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the 
detective, so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both. ## 

IN the modern English "whodunnit", this insinuation of 
latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared. 
Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey (the respective creations 
of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers) have retained 
Holmes' 
egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits. Poirot and 
his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that 
they are also extremely dull. Their dedication to the status quo has 
been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism 
of a Sherlock Holmes. The latter's real descendents were unable 
to take root in England; they fled from the Victorian parlor 
and made their way across the stormy Atlantic. In the American "hardboiled" 
detective story of the '20s and '30s, the spirit of the 
mad genius from Baker Street lives on.   Like Holmes, the 
American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time. But 
unlike Holmes, he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt. 
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere, the "hardboiled" 
private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed 
isolation. His alienation is far more acute than Holmes'; he 
is not an eccentric but rather an outcast. With Rex Stout's Nero 
Wolfe, alienation is represented on a purely physical plane. Wolfe 
refuses to ever leave his own house, and spends most of his time drinking 
beer and playing with orchids. More profound and more disturbing, 
however, is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe. 
In a society where everything is for sale, Marlowe is the only 
man who cannot be bought. His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary 
and difficult existence. Beaten, bruised and exhausted, he pursues 
the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low 
morals, always alone, always despised. In the end, he gets his man, but 
no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward. A similar 
tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers 
of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery 
stories, Dashiell Hammett's <The Maltese Falcon>. Sam Spade 
joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled 
statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last, it turns 
out to be a fake. Now the detective must save his own skin by informing 
on the girl he loves, who is also the real murderer. For Sam Spade, 
neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover, it is increasingly difficult 
to distinguish between the two.   Because the private eye 
intends to save society in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself 
in trouble with the police. The latter are either too stupid to 
catch the killer or too corrupt to care. In either case, they do not 
appreciate the private detective's zeal. Perry Mason and Hamilton 
Burger, Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting 
each other than they do in looking for the criminal. Frequently enough, 
the police are themselves in league with the killer; Dashiell 
Hammett's 
<Red Harvest> provides a classic example of this theme. 
But even when the police are honest, they do not trust the private 
eye. He is, like Phillip Marlowe, too alienated to be reliable. Finally, 
in <The Maltese Falcon> among others, the clash between detective 
and police is carried to its logical conclusion: Sam Spade 
becomes the chief murder suspect. In order to exonerate himself, he 
is compelled to find the real criminal, who happens to be his girl friend. 
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes 
now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of 
turning into his opposite. ##

IT IS the growing contradiction 
between individualism and public service in the mystery story which 
creates this fatal dilemma. By upholding his own personal code of behavior, 
the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society 
whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption. That society 
responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo, 
a potential criminal. If the detective insists upon retaining his 
personal standards, he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society. 
He must, in short, cease to be a detective and become a rebel. 
On the other hand, if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession, 
he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism. 
Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write 
mystery 
stories and turning to other pursuits. His successors have adopted 
the opposite alternative. In order to save the mystery story, they 
have converted the private detective into an organization man.

The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by 
Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. At first glance, this hero seems 
to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors. 
For Hammer, nothing is forbidden. He kills when he pleases, 
takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge, jury 
and executioner rolled into one. 
It will be shown that the <objectives> of the cooperative people in 
an organization determine the type of <network> required, because the 
type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages 
enumerated in Table 1. Great stress is placed on the role that 
the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness 
of the network. By monitoring, we mean some system of control 
over the types of information sent from the various centers. 
As a word of caution, we should be aware that in actual practice no 
message is purely one of the four types, question, command, statement, 
or exclamation. For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving 
a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk, "What 
time is it"? This sentence would have most of the characteristics 
of a question, but it has some of the characteristics of a statement 
because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in 
his own timepiece or the one attached to his car. If the man on the 
sidewalk is surprised at this question, it has served as an exclamation. 
Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer 
(and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer) the question 
has assumed some measurable properties of a command. However, for 
convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified 
according to Table 1. On this basis, certain extreme kinds of networks 
will be discussed for illustrative purposes. 

#NETWORKS ILLUSTRATING 
SOME SPECIAL TYPES OF ORGANIZATION#

_THE COCKTAIL PARTY._ 
Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire 
to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted 
and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy 
for future cooperative endeavors. The party is usually in a room 
small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another. 
The information is furnished by each of the guests, is sent by 
oral broadcasting over the air waves, and is received by the ears. Since 
the air is a continuum, the network of communication remains intact 
regardless of the positions or motions of the points (the people) 
in the net. As shown in Figure 1, there is a connection for communication 
between every pair of points. This, and other qualifications, make 
the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication 
system ever dreamed up. All four types of message listed in Table 
1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding 
the commands to a minimum, while <exclamations> having complimentary 
intonations are more than customarily encouraged. The completeness 
of the connections provide that, for ~<N> people, there are **f 
lines of communication between the pairs, which can become a large number 
(1,225) for a party of fifty guests. Looking at the diagram, we 
see that **f connection lines come in to each member. Thus the cocktail 
party would appear to be the ideal system, but there is one weakness. 
In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group, the 
**f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond 
comprehension if ~<N> exceeds about six. The crowd consequently 
breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six, with 
a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.

For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else 
and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers, then 
the "open house" system is advantageous because the honored guests 
are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections 
at the door. _THE RURAL COMMUNITY._ We consider a rural 
community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration 
is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary 
for family subsistence. We assume for this illustration that the 
size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings 
is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication 
is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2. Information 
beyond nearest neighbor is carried second-, third-, and fourth-hand 
as a distortable rumor. In Figure 2, the points in the network are 
designated by a letter accompanied by a number. The numbers indicate 
the number of nearest neighbors. It will be noted that point ~<f> 
has seven nearest neighbors, ~<h> and ~<e> have six, and ~<p> 
has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate numbers. 
In any social system in which communications have an importance 
comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point 
like ~<f> in Figure 2 would (other things being equal) be the dwelling 
place for the community leader, while ~<e> and ~<h> would 
house the next most important citizens. A point like ~<p> gets 
information directly from ~<n>, but all information beyond ~<n> 
is indirectly relayed through ~<n>. The dweller at ~<p> is 
last to hear about a new cure, the slowest to announce to his neighbors 
his urgent distresses, the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the 
one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or 
getting people to join him in a cooperative effort. Since the hazards 
of poor communication are so great, ~<p> can be justified as a habitable 
site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made 
available by a waterfall for milling purposes, a mine, or a sugar maple 
camp. Location theorists have given these matters much consideration. 
_MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS._ The networks for military communications 
are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be 
changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the 
addition of new machines of war. They also furnish proof that, in 
modern war, message sending must be monitored. Without monitoring, a 
military hookup becomes a noisy party. The need for monitoring became 
greater when radio was adopted for military signaling. Alexander the 
Great, who used runners as message carriers, did not have to worry about 
having every officer in his command hear what he said and having 
hundreds of them comment at once. As time has passed and science has 
progressed, the speed of military vehicles has increased, the range of 
missiles has been extended, the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles 
has been adopted, and the range and breadth of message sending 
has increased. Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision 
making, network structure seems to be paramount, and without monitoring 
no network has value.   On the parade ground the net may be similar 
to that shown in Figure 3. The monitoring is the highest and 
most restrictive of any organization in existence. No questions, statements, 
or explanations are permitted- only commands. Commands go only 
from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank. The same command 
is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to 
corporal. All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and 
terminate with action of the men in the ranks. Even the officer in charge, 
be it a captain (for small display) or a general, is restrained 
by monitoring. This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the 
hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility. 
The commands are specified by the military regulations; are 
few in number, briefly worded, all different in sound; and are combinable 
into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be 
desired on a parade ground. This monitoring is necessary because, on 
a parade ground, everyone can hear <too much>, and without monitoring 
a confused social event would develop.   With troops dispersed 
on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground, it may seem that 
a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines 
of communication. Years ago this was true, but with the replacement 
of wires or runners by radio and radar (and perhaps television), these 
restrictions have disappeared and now again <too much> is heard.

In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even 
in the field, are more formal. In the extreme and oversimplified example 
suggested in Figure 3, the organization is more easily understood 
and more predictable in behavior. A military organization has an objective 
chosen by the higher command. This objective is adhered to throughout 
the duration of the action. The connective system, or network, 
is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore 
not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated 
unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college, 
or a rural village.   The assumptions upon which the example 
shown 
in Figure 3 is based are: (a) One man can direct about six subordinates 
if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not 
need too much personal coaching, indoctrinating, etc&. (b) A message 
runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more 
than about six consecutive times. (c) Decisions of a general kind 
are made by the central command. And (d) all action of a physical kind 
pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower 
rank. These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the 
top, six directly under him, six under each of these, and so on until 
there are six levels of personnel. The number of people acting as one 
body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of **f 55,987 
men.   This organizational network would be of no avail if there 
were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent. Of types 
of message listed in Table 1, commands and statements are the only 
ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3. A further 
regulation is that commands always go <down>, unaccompanied by statements, 
and statements always go <up>, unaccompanied by commands. Questions 
and, particularly, exclamations are usually channeled along informal, 
horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried 
beyond the nearest neighbor.   It will readily be seen that 
in this suggested network (not materially different from some of the 
networks in vogue today) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than 
is usually put into practice. Furthermore, the network in Figure 
3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics 
and the like are interlaced.   Not discussed here are some 
military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare, where the 
surveillance, sending, transmitting, and receiving are all so inadequate 
that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks. Such 
problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much 
like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall 
grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they 
could teach. _A TEAM FOR USEFUL RESEARCH._ This is an unsolved 
problem which probably has never been seriously investigated, although 
one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient <specialists> 
of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss, for example, 
in precision machinery and mathematics, or the Finns in geochemistry. 
We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have 
not enough <generalists> who can see the over-all picture and combine 
our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes. This problem 
of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and 
specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis. Since 
the difficulty of drawing the net is great, we will merely discuss 
it.   First, we realize that a pure specialist does not exist. But, 
for practical purposes, we have people who can be considered as such. 
For example, there are persons who are in physical science, in the 
field of mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only X-rays, 
applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction, to clay 
minerals only, and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating 
on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the 
field of anthropology, studying the lung capacity of seven Andean 
Indians. So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more 
about less and less as he develops, as contrasted to the generalist, 
who knows less and less about more and more. 
AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC THOUGHT, pointed up the relation between the 
Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social 
religion, which he called the American Democratic Faith. Those familiar 
with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the 
democratic faith at around 1850. And he describes it as a balanced polarity 
between the notions of the free individual and what he called 
the fundamental law.   I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called 
fundamental law. But first I want to quote him on the relationship 
that he found between religion and politics in this country and 
what happened to it. He points out that from the time of Jackson on 
through World War /1,, evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence 
in the social and political life of America. He terms this 
early enthusiasm "Romantic Christianity" and concludes that its 
similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that "the doctrine 
of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical 
Protestantism". Let me quote him even more fully, for his 
analysis is important to my theme.   He says: "Beside the 
Protestant philosophy of Progress, as expressed in radical or conservative 
millenarianism, should be placed the doctrine of the democratic 
faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United 
States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted 
the beacon of democracy". He specifies, "In the middle period 
of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism, 
in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism. But in 
every period it has been humanism". And let me add, utopianism, also.

Some fourteen or fifteen years ago, in an essay I called 
<The Leader Follows- Where?> I used his polarity to illustrate 
what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call 
Progressivism. It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the 
balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law 
in the common man. That is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been 
so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor 
law any more. It is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never 
seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been 
cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy. And 
with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel 
called Christian supernaturalism. And the common man was developing 
mythic power, or charisma, on his own.   During the decade 
that followed, the common man, as that piece put it, grew uncomfortable 
as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow (Wilson) 
only to learn from Science, to his shocked relief that after all there 
was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow- 
that there was a chemical formula for him, and that too much couldn't 
be expected of him.   The socialism implicit in the slogan 
of the Roosevelt Revolution, freedom from want and fear, seems a 
far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution, 
or of the Jacksonian frontier. What had happened to the common 
man?   French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence 
in this country before the days of Popularism. The riotous onrush 
of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general 
secular drift to the Religion of Humanity, however, prepared 
the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring 
of one sort of another. The first of which to find important place 
in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson. 
Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s, the 
dislocations of the Depression, the common ethos of Materialism everywhere, 
all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced 
Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy 
of the Little People.   However, it is important to trace the 
philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the 
common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence 
of the latter on the former. That John Locke's philosophy of 
the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration 
of Independence, I believe, we generally accept. Yet, after 
Rousseau had given the <social contract> a new twist with his notion 
of the General Will, the same philosophy, it may be said, became 
the idea source of the French Revolution also.   The importance 
of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us, however. This 
notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in 
the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship. And it 
is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle, in his remarkable long 
essay, <The Heresy of Democracy>, and in a more general way by 
Voegelin, in his <New Science of Politics>, that this same Rousseauan 
idea, descending through European democracy, is the source of 
Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is important 
to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves 
in after World War /2, and our great democratic victory 
that brought no peace.   The long road that had taken liberals in 
this country into the social religion of democracy, into a worship of 
man, led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under 
a Socialist State. And the ~USSR existed as the revolutionary 
experiment in radical socialism, the ultimate exemplar. And by the 
time the war ended, liberal leadership in this country was spiritually 
Marxist.   We will recall that the still confident liberals of 
the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in 
San Francisco to set up the legal framework, finally and at last, to 
rationalize war- to rationalize want and fear- out of the world: 
the United Nations. We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace 
and rehabilitation. Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle 
of another fight, an irrational, an indecent, an undeclared and immoral 
war with our strongest (and some had thought noblest) ally.

During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly 
backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal. During 
the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in 
the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative 
policy of Containment- and the bitterest irony- enforced and enforceable 
only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste 
for but could not abandon: the atom bomb. In 1952, it will be remembered, 
the G&O&P& without positive program campaigned on the 
popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly.

All of this, I know, is recent history familiar to you. But 
I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common 
man, to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership.

A perceptive journalist, Sam Lubell, has phrased it in the 
title of one of his books as THE REVOLT OF THE MODERATES. He opens 
his discourse, however, with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural 
festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents, 
all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age. The 
show was colorful, indeed, exuberant, but the press for all its assiduity 
could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.

Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue. 
And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation: "In essence 
the drama of his (Eisenhower's) Presidency can be described 
as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling- thus far 
with but limited and precarious success- to give effective voice 
and force to that conservatism".   I will assume that we are 
all aware of the continuing struggle, with its limited and precarious 
success, toward conservatism. It has moved on various levels, it has 
been clamorous and confused. Obviously there has been no agreement on 
what American conservatism is, or rather, what it should be. For it 
was neglected, not to say nascent, when the struggle began. I saw a 
piece the other day assailing William Buckley, author of MAN AND 
GOD AT YALE and publisher of the <National Review>, as no conservative 
at all, but an old liberal. I would agree with this view. But 
I'm not here to define conservatism.   What I am here to do 
is to report on the gyrations of the struggle- a struggle that amounts 
to self-redefinition- to see if we can predict its future course.

One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of 
the last election, I suppose, is that we, the majority, were dissatisfied 
with Eisenhower conservatism. Though, to be sure, we gave Kennedy 
no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment. 
This is, however, symptomatic of our national malaise. But before I 
try to diagnose it, I would offer other evidence. I will mention two 
volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year. 
The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise, sponsored by <Life> 
magazine, under the title of <the National purpose>. The contributors 
to this testament were all well-known: a former Democratic 
candidate for President, a New Deal poet, the magazine's chief 
editorial writer, two newspaper columnists, head of a national broadcasting 
company, a popular Protestant evangelist, etc&. What I want 
to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals, or modified liberals, 
with perhaps one exception. I suppose we might classify Billy 
Graham as an old liberal. And I would further note that they all- 
with one exception again- sang in one key or another the same song. 
Its refrain was: "Let us return to the individualistic democracy 
of our forefathers for our salvation".   Adlai Stevenson 
expressed some reservations about this return. Others invoked technology 
and common sense. Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility 
of our having "outlived most of what we used to regard as the program 
of our national purposes".   But the most notable thing about 
the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth 
of <socialism> was conspicuously absent.   The second specific 
comment was the report of Eisenhower's Commission on National 
Goals, titled GOALS FOR AMERICANS. They, perhaps, gave the pitch 
of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower 
requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly 
of Columbia University, because it was <non-partisan>. The 
Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the 
<unconscious> liberal, but not unconscious enough, to invoke the now 
taboo symbolism of socialism. And here again we hear the same refrain 
mentioned above: "The paramount goal of the United States 
**h set long ago **h was to guard the rights of the individual **h ensure 
his development **h enlarge his opportunity". This group is secularist 
and their program tends to be technological.   But it is 
the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as 
symptom of the common man's malaise. And let me add Murray's new 
book as another symptom of it, particularly so in view of the attention 
TIME magazine gave it when it came out recently. Father Murray 
goes back to the Declaration of Independence, too, though I may 
add, with considerably more historical perception.   I will reserve 
discussion of it for a moment, however, to return to President Kennedy. 
As symptomatic of the common man's malaise, he is most significant: 
a liberal and a Catholic, elected by the skin of his teeth. 
Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy, not to say confused, 
state of the public mind?   What is the common man's 
complaint? Let's take a panoramic look back over the course we 
have come. Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism 
up until the turning back under Eisenhower? And the basic character 
of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic. Ralph 
Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress. But 
there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook.

DOES our society have a runaway, uncontrollable growth of 
technology which may end our civilization, or a normal, healthy growth? 
Here there may be an analogy with cancer: we can detect cancers 
by their rapidly accelerating growth, determinable only when related 
to the more normal rate of healthy growth. Should the accelerating 
growth of technology then warn us? Noting such evidence is the first 
step; and almost the only "cure" is <early> detection and removal. 
One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology 
would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their 
functioning is as healthy as before. So an objective look at our 
present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous 
situation. In any event, whether society may have cancer, or merely 
a virus infection, the "disease", we shall find, is political, 
economical, social, and even medical. Have not our physical abilities 
already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now 
living? Hence the prime issue, as I see it, is whether a democratic 
or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind, 
or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible 
with <its> own needs as a force of nature.   We are already committed 
to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere 
on earth, not merely in the limited social-political-economical context 
we are fond of today. Otherwise, we go on endlessly trying to draw 
the line, color and other, as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate. 
We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to 
contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is 
to be extremely shortsighted, if nothing else. We must believe we have 
the ability to affect our own destinies: otherwise why try anything? 
So in these pages the term "technology" is used to include any 
and all means which could amplify, project, or augment man's control 
over himself and over other men. Naturally this includes all communication 
forms, e&g& languages, or any social, political, economic 
or religious structures employed for such control. Properly mindful 
of <all> the cultures in existence today throughout the world, we must 
employ these resources without war or violent revolution.   If 
we were creating a wholly new society, we could insist that our social, 
political, economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than 
hamper man; best growth. But we cannot start off with a clean slate. 
So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to 
the effect of each on man's major needs. Asked which institution 
most needs correction, I would say the corporation as it exists in America 
today. At first glance this appears strange: of all people, 
was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new 
way of life still inspiring "undeveloped" societies abroad? But 
hear Harrison E& Salisbury, former Moscow correspondent of The 
New York Times, and author of "To Moscow- And Beyond". 
In a book review of "The Soviet Cultural Offensive", he says, 
"Long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into 
an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive 
within Soviet borders, the sharp cutting-edge of American 
culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes, as when the enterprising 
promoters of 'Porgy and Bess' overrode the State Department 
to carry the contemporary 'cultural warfare' behind the 
enemy lines. They were not diplomats or jazz musicians, or even organizers 
of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays, but rugged capitalist 
entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Hugh Cooper, Thomas Campbell, 
the International Harvester Co&, and David W& Griffith. Their 
kind created an American culture superior to any in the world, an 
industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did 
almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal 
treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or 
program a series of consultations of interested agencies. This favorable 
image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still 
there despite years of energetic anti-American propaganda **h" 

#CORPORATIONS NOW OUTMODED#

Perhaps the public's present attitude 
toward business stems from the fact that the "rugged capitalist entrepreneur" 
no more exists in America. In his stead is a milquetoast 
version known as "the corporation". But even if we cannot see 
the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America, foreigners 
can; and our loss of "prestige" abroad is the direct result. 
No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts. If we want respect 
from ourselves or others, we will have to earn it. First, let us 
realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times, now 
the corporation <per se> cannot take economic leadership. Businesses 
must develop as a result of the ideas, energies and ambitions of an 
individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within <one> mind. 
When we "forced" individuals to assume the corporate structure 
by means of taxes and other legal statutes, we adopted what I would 
term "pseudo-capitalism" and so took a major step toward socialism. 
The biggest loss, of course, was the individual's lessened desire 
and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and 
our economy. Socialism, I grant, has a definite place in our society. 
But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to 
a form that is not truly capitalistic. Some forms of capitalism do indeed 
work- superb organizations, a credit to any society. But the pseudo-capitalism 
which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics 
and social life, will not stand close scrutiny. Its pretense to operate 
in the public interest is little more than a sham. It serves 
only its own stockholders and poorly at that. As a creative enterprise, 
its abilities are primarily in "swallowing" creative enterprises 
developed outside its own organization (an ability made possible by 
us, and almost mandatory). As to benefits to employees, it is notorious 
for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services.

The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism, 
vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged 
within governmental bureaucracy. But while the corporation has all 
the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization (so cumbersome 
it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its 
need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo), unluckily it 
does not have the desirable aspect of socialism, the motivation to operate 
for the benefit of society as a whole. So we are faced with a 
vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever 
manner they can, without regard to the needs of society, controlling 
society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's 
needs for survival.   The corporation has a limited, specific 
place in our society. Ideally speaking, it should be allowed to operate 
only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply 
or services, and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary 
to the needs of society. Examples are in public utilities, making 
military aircraft and accessories, or where the investment and risk 
for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible 
to achieve by any means other than the corporate form, e&g& 
constructing major airports or dams. Thus, if corporations are not 
to run away with us, they must become quasi-governmental institutions, 
subject to public control and needs. In all other areas, private initiative 
of the "proprietorship" type should be urged to produce the 
desired goods and services. 

#PROPRIETORSHIP#

Avoiding runaway 
technology can be done only by assuring a humane society; and for this 
human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our 
society rests. Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can 
offer, corporations cannot. It can project long-range goals for itself. 
Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli, e& g&, 
quarterly and annual dividend reports. Proprietorships can establish 
a unity and integrity of control; corporations, being more amorphous, 
cannot. Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity, representing 
a human personality, and thus establish sincere relationships with 
customers and community. Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal, 
inhumane, shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated, 
a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public. The 
proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate 
structure with its board of directors and stockholders. Leadership is 
lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop. 
Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences 
of the most varied, complicated and trying type so that at maturation 
they have developed the competence and willingness to accept 
the personal responsibility so sorely needed now.   Hence government 
must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their 
activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest. 
Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations, 
e& g& the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth. 
Corporations should pay added taxes, to be used for educational purposes 
(not necessarily of the formal type). The right to leave legacies 
should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated. To perpetuate 
wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no 
role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to 
the fore, and is basically anti-democratic. When the proprietor dies, 
the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired 
by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it. Strikes 
should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements 
would have to be settled by government representatives acting as 
controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would 
now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors 
must be completely interdependent, as they are each a part of the 
whole. Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship, if internally 
motivated, prevent a healthy relationship. Certainly external 
forces 
should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to 
do so. <If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system, how can 
we expect to abolish it internationally?> 

#ONE KIND OF PROPRIETORSHIP# 

These proposals would go far toward creating the economic 
atmosphere favoring growth of the individual, who, in turn, would help 
us to cope with runaway technology. Individual <human> strength is 
needed to pit against an inhuman condition. The battle is not easy. 
We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them 
straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible 
of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed, 
enlightened, competent leaders. Persons developed in to-day's corporations 
cannot hope to serve here- a judgment based on experiences 
of my own in business and in activities outside. In my own company, in 
effect a partnership, although legally a corporation, I have been able 
to do many things for my employees which "normal" corporations 
of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do. Also, I 
am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of 
a partnership, I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems 
for myself and my fellow-employees. Any abilities I may have were 
achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the 
growth and control of my business, coupled with raising my family. This 
combined experience, on a foundation of very average, I assure you, 
intelligence and background, has helped me do things many well-informed 
people would bet heavily against. Perhaps a list of some of the "practices" 
of my company will help here.   The company grew 
out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties, 
neither having a formal education applicable to, or experience in, 
manufacturing or selling our type of articles. From an initial investment 
of $1,200 in 1943, it has grown, with no additional capital investment, 
to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 
(<we> don't disclose financial figures to the public). Its growth 
continues steadily on a par with past growth; and no limitation is 
in evidence. Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance 
in just a few years time, despite substantial, well established competition.

DURING the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration, 
a red scare developed in our country. Many Americans reacted irrationally 
to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of 
ideas by force. Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the 
American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through 
the mails. Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that 
sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails, in direct violation 
of their constitutional rights. Then, not many years later, the 
Un-American Activities Committee, under the leadership of Martin 
Dies, pilloried hundreds of decent, patriotic citizens. Anyone who 
tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy 
was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction 
of our government. This hysteria reached its height under the 
leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Demagogues of this sort found 
communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter 
to stereotyped notions. New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed, 
no matter how.   Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts, 
credit ideas with high potency. They give strict interpretation to 
William James' statement that "Every idea that enters the mind 
tends to express itself". They seem to believe that a person will 
act automatically as soon as he contacts something new. Hence, the only 
defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion, unless it 
gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.   Despite this danger, 
however, we are informed on every hand that ideas, not machines, are 
our finest tools; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded 
on a ledger page; they are the most valuable of commodities- 
and the most salable, for their demand far exceeds supply. So all-important 
are ideas, we are told, that persons successful in business and 
happy in social life usually fall into two classes: those who invent 
new ideas of their own, and those who borrow, beg, or steal from others.

Seemingly, with an unrestricted flow of ideas, all will 
be well, and we are even assured that "an idea a day will keep the sheriff 
away". That, however, may also bring the police, if the thinking 
does not meet with social approval. Criminals, as well as model 
citizens, exercise their minds. Merely having a mental image of some 
sort is not the all-important consideration.   Of course, there 
must be clarity: a single distinct impression is more valuable than 
many fuzzy ones. But clarity is not enough. The writer took a class 
of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St& 
Joseph, Missouri. An inmate, a former university professor, expounded 
to us, logically and clearly, that someone was pilfering his thoughts. 
He appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities 
that justice might be done. Despite the clarity of his presentation, 
his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre.   True, ideas 
are important, perhaps life's most precious treasures. But have we 
not gone overboard in stressing their significance? Have we not actually 
developed idea worship?   Ideas we must have, and we seek 
them everywhere. We scour literature for them; here we find stored 
the wisdom of great minds. But are all these works worthy of consideration? 
Can they stand rigid scrutiny?   Shakespeare's 
wit and wisdom, his profound insight into human nature, have stood the 
test of centuries. But was he infallible in all things? What of 
his treatment of the Jew in <The Merchant of Venice?> 
Shakespeare 
gives us a vivid picture of Shylock, but probably he never saw a 
Jew, unless in some of his travels. The Jews had been banished from 
England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655, when 
Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years. If any had escaped 
expulsion by hiding, they certainly would not frequent the market-place.

Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays, 
but borrowed them from old stories, ballads, and plays, wove them 
together, and then breathed into them his spark of life. Rather than 
from a first-hand study of Jewish people, his delineation of Shylock 
stems from a collection of Italian stories, <Il Pecorone>, published 
in 1558, 
although written almost two centuries earlier. He could 
learn at second hand from books, but could not thus capture the real 
Jewish spirit. Harris J& Griston, in <Shaking The Dust From 
Shakespeare> (216), writes: "There is not a word spoken by Shylock 
which one would expect from a real Jew".   He took the 
story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone. The Jew 
was the safest victim. No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially 
struggling theater. It would have been unwise policy, for instance, 
to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman. 
Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars, or even 
of Tikopia, and no senatorial investigation will result. Who cares 
about them!   Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an 
aberrant individual. He sets him forth as being typical of the group. 
He tells of his "Jewish heart"- not a Shylockian heart; 
but a Jewish heart. This would make anyone crafty and cruel, capable 
of fiendish revenge.   There is no justification for such misrepresentation. 
If living Jews were unavailable for study, the Bible 
was at hand. Reading the Old Testament would have shown the dramatist 
that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews.

Are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea of Shylock? 
Studying <The Merchant of Venice> in high school and college 
has given many young people their notions about Jews. Does this help 
the non-Jew to understand this group?   Thomas de Torquemada, 
Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition, put many persons 
to death. His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty. Would 
we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's Roman 
Catholics by saying he had a Catholic heart? Let his bones and 
his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong; he is 
out of place in our times. Shakespeare's Shylock, too, is of dubious 
value in the modern world.   Ideas, in and of themselves, are 
not necessarily the greatest good. A successful businessman recently 
prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all 
economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where 
they and their theories might rot together. Will his words come 
to be treasured and quoted through the years?   Frequently we 
are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted 
and in the end only the good ones will survive. But is that not 
like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids 
and powders from an array of bottles and then, after stirring, expecting 
a new wonder drug inevitably to result?   What of the efficiency 
of this natural instrument of free discussion? Is there some 
magic in it that assures results?   When Peter B& Kyne 
(<Pride of Palomar>, 43) informed us in 1921 that we had an <instinctive> 
dislike for the Japanese, did the heated debates of the Californians 
settle the truth or falsity of the proposition?   <The 
Leopard's Spots> came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902, 
and in this he announced an "unchangeable" law. If a child had 
a single drop of Negro blood, he would revert to the ancestral line which, 
except as slaves under a superior race, had not made one step of 
progress in 3,000 years. That doctrine has been accepted by many, but 
has it produced good results?   In the same vein, a certain 
short-story plot has been overworked. The son and heir of a prominent 
family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of 
her finger nails. In time she presents her aristocratic husband with 
a coal-black child. Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon 
it? Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity?

For answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists, 
the biologists, the historians, the psychologists, and the sociologists. 
Long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap 
heap.   False ideas surfeit another sector of our life. For 
several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship. 
The stepmother, almost without exception, has been presented 
as a cruel ogress. Children, conditioned by this mistaken notion, 
have feared stepmothers, while adults, by their antagonistic attitudes, 
have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one. Debate 
is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild 
a happier one. Research, on the other hand, has shown many stepmothers 
to be eminently successful, some far better than the real mothers.

Helen Deutsch informed us (<The Psychology of Women>, 
Vol& /2,, 434) that in all cultures "the term 'stepmother' 
automatically evokes deprecatory implications", a conclusion accepted 
by many. Will mere debate on that proposition, even though it be 
free and untrammeled, remove the dross and leave a residue of refined 
gold? That is questionable, to say the least. Research into several 
cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one.   Most 
assuredly ideas are invaluable. But ideas, just for the sake of having 
them, are not enough. In the 1930's, cures for the depression literally 
flooded Washington. For a time the President received hundreds 
of them every day, most of them worthless.   Ideas need to be 
tested, and not merely by argument and debate. When some question arises 
in the medical field concerning cancer, for instance, we do not 
turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign. We have 
recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory. The 
merits of the Salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the 
forensic platform or in newspaper editorials, but in the laboratory 
and by tests in the field on thousands of children.   Our presidential 
campaigns provide much debate and argument. But is the result 
new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence 
solve our domestic and international problems? Man, we are 
told, is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from 
bad. But what a super-Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value 
from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely, particularly since 
such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes, in themselves 
declarations of intellectual bankruptcy.   We are reminded, however, 
that freedom of thought and discussion, the unfettered exchange 
of ideas, is basic under our form of government.   Assuredly in 
our political campaigns there is freedom to think, to examine any and 
all issues, and to speak without restraint. No holds are barred. But 
have the results been heartening? May we state with confidence that 
in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security?

We must not forget, to be sure, that free discussion and debate 
have produced beneficial results. In truth, we can say that this broke 
the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was finally exposed 
in full light to the American people. If he had been "liquidated" 
in some way, he would have become a martyr, a rallying point for people 
who shared his ideas. Debate in the political arena can be productive 
of good. But it is a clumsy and wasteful process: it can produce 
negative results but not much that is positive. Debate rid us of 
McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive. It did something 
to clear the ground, but it erected no striking new structure; it 
did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new. 
In the field of the natural sciences, scientifically verified data are 
quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good 
results. In the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of 
tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage.

By no means would we discourage the production of ideas: 
they provide raw materials with which to work; they provide stimulations 
that lead to further production. We would establish no censorship. 
The President's personality would have opened that office to him. 
And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the 
land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make 
it a successorship by inheritance. It is testimony to the deep respect 
in which Mr& Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that 
the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were 
not explicitly to be broached.   These began to be apparent in a 
press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting 
specialists might clarify the President's condition for the 
nation. And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate 
the ethics of the medical profession, his article in the <Atlantic 
Monthly> accomplished a good deal more. It forced us to fix the responsibility 
for the position in which all medical commentators had been 
placed. The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded 
us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will 
finally clarify itself as a moral, rather than a medical, problem. Because 
the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President, 
rather than with his doctors, nothing raises more surely for us 
the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems 
under political pressure. For the President had dealt with the 
matter humbly, in what he conceived as the democratic way. But the 
problem is one which gives us the measure of a man, rather than a group 
of men, whether a group of doctors, a group of party members assembled 
at a dinner to give their opinion, or the masses of the voters.

Any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in 
the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive 
it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the 
chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and 
President in a situation which should never have arisen. It was a 
response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition 
which resulted in attempts at prediction. In no other situation 
would a group of doctors, struggling competently to improve the life 
expectancy of a man beloved by the world, be subjected to such merciless 
and persistent questioning, and before they were prepared to demonstrate 
the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind 
the problems it faces. And though we can look back now and see their 
errors, we can look back also to the ultimate error.   It recurred 
in the press conferences: the President's remarks about his running 
developed a singular tone, one which we find in few statements 
made by public individuals on such a matter. The press conference became 
a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking, rather than 
his convictions. He commented- thoughtfully, a reporter told us- 
that it was "not too important for the individual how he ends up". 
He gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst 
period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any 
renewed question about his running: as in the Battle of the Bulge, 
he had no fears about the outcome until he read the American newspapers. 
Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such 
a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed 
with battles to be fought, regardless of the consequences. In this 
case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears. The 
Presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications 
of the death of any incumbent. It is of the utmost importance to the 
people of America and of the world how their governing President "ends 
up" during the four years of his term. Only when that term is 
ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom 
and the courage to discount the dangers of his death. Ironically enough, 
in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury.   At 
the national and international level, then, what is the highest kind 
of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political 
immorality. And we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the 
moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us. 
For the tone of the editorials which greeted Mr& Eisenhower's 
original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting. 
Neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive 
sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation 
betraying its sense that something significant has transpired 
was in evidence. Nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than 
the peculiar editorial page appearing in a July issue of <Life Magazine>, 
the issue which also carried the second announcement of the 
candidacy. The double editorial on two aspects of "The U& S& 
Spirit" was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles 
great as well as small, reflecting popular approval of this questionable 
attitude toward the highest office in the land. "The Moral 
Creed" and "The Will to Risk" live happily together, if we 
do not examine where the line is to be drawn. "I may possibly be a 
greater risk than is the normal person of my age", the President had 
said on February 29th of the election year, ignoring the fact that 
no one of his age had ever lived out another term. "My doctors assure 
me that this increased percentage of risk is not great". But by 
the time the risk was doubled, events had dismissed from his mind both 
increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering 
carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza. Only infrequently 
did the situation color his thinking. Ironically no president 
we have had would have regretted more than President Eisenhower the 
possibility to which his own words, in the press conference held at 
the beginning of August, testified: that unable as he was himself 
to say his running was best for the country, unconsciously he had placed 
his party before his nation.   So it is that we relive his opening 
statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy 
of the present. No consideration of risk urges itself upon him 
now: for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not 
properly focussed. Yet with a mind less shallow, if less sharp, than 
some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him, he feels what 
he cannot formulate; and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest 
he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters. Moving 
as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of 
him, he adopts a position that is morally indefensible. He ascribes 
to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter- the assurance 
that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer 
than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do- 
has brought him. What is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the 
laws of human probability, whether or not it is later confirmed, has 
become by September of the election year "a firm conviction". 
As 
a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place, the 
statement is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal confusion 
which gives rise to such convictions. But it is also the climax 
to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history.

In assigning to God the responsibility which he learned could 
not rest with his doctors, Eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening 
of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration 
in the years to follow. In any other man this reassurance to the electorate 
would have caused us a profound moral shock. About this man we 
had to think twice. We knew that it was, as reassurance, the ironic 
fruit of a deeply moral nature. But the fact remains that even the unconscious 
acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected 
must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major 
decisions, and thus for imposing his will on the people. And in the 
context of drifting personal utterances we have examined, there was 
occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions. When the possibility 
that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision 
seemed 
to disconcert his questioners, Mr& Eisenhower was known to 
make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going 
to talk about the matter any more. Thinking had stopped; it was not 
to be resumed.   The portrait that had developed, fragmentarily 
but consistently, was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking 
is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits, when it does not 
forestall, any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence. 
This does not mean that the decision to run for office should 
inevitably have been revoked. Instead it means that the thinking in 
which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the 
decision, as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative 
attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered 
might have done. Drifting through a third illness, apparently 
without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency 
other than a talk with the vice-president, Eisenhower revealed the singularly 
static quality of his thinking. Despite three warnings, no 
sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation, and 
thus his responsibilities, from Wilson's. ##

By contrast, the 
energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes 
upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure 
of the man. Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed 
considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention 
to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality 
in the major decision are effectively to be checked. In the 
incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus 
the essence of a problem in the significant detail, and to articulate 
the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant, with what 
is sometimes astounding rapidity. Like Lincoln, he can distinguish 
his relation to God from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable 
decision exacts of him. Like Roosevelt, he can distinguish an 
attitude toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of Americans 
from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him. 
He chooses to subordinate one to the other, sometimes reluctantly, 
accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed. The very 
nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the 
valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader. 
The capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact, 
and the facility with language which can render them into validity 
in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the 
moral intuition into moral leadership.   The making of distinctions, 
like the perception of the great distinctions made, is an inordinately 
difficult business. Lincoln's slow progress towards the several 
marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such, and loosely 
interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision. But 
because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other 
by means of the capacities with which words endow it, we do not unwisely 
examine the type of distinction, in the sphere of politics, on which 
decisions hang. Only recently, and perhaps because a television debate 
can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary 
mastery of detail, have the abilities on which the capacity for making 
distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of 
politics. 
In his recent evaluation of Kennedy's potentialities for 
leadership, Walter Lippmann has cited the "precision" of his mind, 
his "immense command" of factual detail, and his "instinct for 
the crucial point" as impressive in the extreme; and it is surely 
clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the 
individual's command of language interacts with the other two. 
For this change is not a change from one positive position to another, 
but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation. The 
liberal-conservative 
division, we might observe in passing, is not of itself 
directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle 
between ruling groups. Rather it is rooted in a difference of response 
to the threat of social disintegration. The division is not between 
those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change. 
Rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways 
of thought with regard to man's life in society. These ways are 
absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for 
man's redemption from chaos.   The civilizational crisis, the 
third type of change raises the question "what are we to do"? 
on the most primitive level. For the answer cannot be derived from any 
socially cohesive element in the disrupting community. There is no 
socially existential answer to the question. For the truth formerly experienced 
by the community no longer has existential status in the community, 
nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians. 
In this phase of change, no idea has social acceptance and so none 
has ontological status in the community. An interregnum ensues in which 
not men but ideas compete for existence.   If we examine the 
three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure 
we find an additional profound difference between the third and the 
first two, one that accounts for the notable difference between the 
responses they evoke. The first two types of change occur within the 
inward and immanent structure of the society. The first involves a simple 
shift of interests in the society. The second involves something 
deeper, but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for 
the community, not in the truth on which the community rests. Thus in 
both types attention is focused on the community itself, and its phenomenological 
life. The third type, however, wrenches attention from 
the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the 
ground of being on which the community depends for its existence. Voegelin 
has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable, healthy 
community. There the community, faced with the need to formulate policy 
on the level of absolute justice, can find the answer to its problem 
in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced. This, 
however, cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth 
is confused and incoherent: it has no absolute standard, and consequently 
cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent. It has 
lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances. Relativism 
and equality are its characteristic diseases. Precisely at the moment 
when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out 
from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure 
itself. For paradigmatic history "breaks" rather than unfolds 
precisely when the movement is from order to disorder, and not from 
one order to a new order. The liberal-conservative split, to define 
it further, derives from a basic difference concerning the existential 
status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads 
to its identification.   When disruptive change has penetrated 
to the third level of social order, the process of disruption rapidly 
reaches a point of no return. Indeed, it is probable that this point 
is reached the moment the third level of change begins. At that point 
we reach the "closed" historical situation: the situation in 
which man is no longer free to return to a <status quo ante>. At that 
point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously "fate", 
or "destiny", or "providence", and feel themselves 
caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society. The reasons 
for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of 
such a change.   Of all forms of being, society, or community, 
has the greatest element of determinability. Its ontological status is 
itself most tenuous because apart from individual men, who are its "matter", 
tradition, the "form" of society exists only as a shared 
perception of truth. The ontological status of society thus is constituted 
by the psychological-intellectual-volitional status of society's 
members. The content of that psychological status determines, 
ultimately, the content of civilization. Those social, civilizational 
factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group, ultimately cease 
to exist. Civilization itself- tradition- falls out of existence 
when the human spirit itself becomes confused. Civilization is what 
man has made of himself. Its massive contours are rooted in the simple 
need of man, since he is always incomplete, to complete himself.

It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse. He needs existential 
completion, he needs, that is, to move in the direction of completion. 
And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception 
of the truth about himself. He must, consequently, exist as a 
self-perceived substantive, developing agent, or he does not exist as 
man. Thus, it is no mystical intuition, but an analyzable conception 
to say that man and his tradition can "fall out of existence". This 
happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance 
in himself, of a nature that, in Maritain's words, is perceived as 
a "locus of intelligible necessities". An existentialist is a man 
who perceives himself only as "esse", as existence without substance.

Thus human perception and human volition is the immanent 
cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches 
the civilizational level. Thus with regard to the loss of tradition, 
in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works 
itself out as a disruption of the individual soul, a change in which man 
continues as an objective ontological existent, but no longer as a 
man.   Further, change is a form of motion, it occurs as the act 
of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached 
the terminus of the change. With regard to the change we are examining, 
the question is, at what point does the change become irreversible? 
A number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in 
the process. Change involves the displacement of form. This means that 
the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive 
to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring 
the existent form in being. If the existent form is to be retained new 
factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation. In 
the case of social decay, form is displaced simply by the process of 
dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process. Now in the 
mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence 
of the ontological weakness of the fading form. And when we consider 
the tenuous hold tradition has on existence, any weakening of that 
hold constitutes a crisis of existence. The retention of a tradition 
confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new 
spiritual forces into the situation. However, the crisis occurs precisely 
as a weakening of spiritual forces. It would seem, therefore, that 
in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself. The emergence 
of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory 
of disorder. And it would seem that history is a witness to this 
truth.   As a further characterization of the liberal conservative 
split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for 
escaping inevitabilities in history. These differences, in turn, derive 
from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character 
of change. 

#UNANALYZED RESPONSES#

ANXIETY AND DEEP INSECURITY 
are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition. 
To experience them, it is not necessary for a people to be actively 
aware of what is happening to it. The process of erosion need only 
undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding 
within the individual, while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation 
of processes occurs. Within the individual the reaction has been 
called various names, all, however, pointing to the same basic experience. 
Weil identifies it as being "rootless", Guardini as being 
"placeless", Riesman as being "lonely". Others call it "alienation", 
and mean by that no simple economic experience (as Marx 
does) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation. Within institutions 
there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution 
of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one 
of persuasion. We note the use of rhetoric as a weapon, the manipulation 
of the masses by propaganda, the "mobilization" of effort and 
resources.   Within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed 
responses to the experience of civilizational crisis, two basic organizations 
of response are observable: reaction and ideological progressivism. 
These responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent 
in the crisis. Both are predictably destined to fail.   The 
response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing. 
Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through 
the repression of disruptive forces. To this end political authority 
is called upon to exercise its negative and coercive powers. The implicit 
assumption of this response is that history is reversible. Seemingly, 
order is perceived as a kind of subsistent entity now covered by 
adventitious accretions. The problem is to remove the accretions and 
thereby uncover the order that was always there. Such a response, of 
course, misses the point that in crisis order is going out of existence. 
Moreover its posture of stubborn but simple resistance is doomed 
to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of 
order, once the activation of change has reached visible proportions. 
The most reaction can achieve is stasis, and a stasis that can be maintained 
only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhausts 
itself.   Despite the hopelessness of the response, it is explicable 
in terms of the crisis of tradition itself. Since a civilizational 
crisis involves also a crisis in private interests and in the ruling 
class, reaction is normally found among those who feel themselves 
to be among the ruling class. Their great error is to mingle the responses 
typical of each of the three types of change. Since civilizational 
change is the most difficult to perceive and analyze, it seldom is 
given adequate attention. And the anxiety it generates is misinterpreted 
as anxiety over private interest and threatened social status.

The basic truth in the reactionary response is to be found in its 
realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational. 
But this truth is distorted by its extreme application: the assumption 
of the separate existence of tradition. The reactionary misses 
the point that tradition exists ontologically only in the form of 
psychological-intellectual 
relations. Reactionary theories, for this reason, 
usually assume some form of organismic theory. In its defensive 
formulations, the theory will attack conscious change on the grounds of 
the independent existence of the community. In its dynamic form, it 
visualizes the community as the embodiment of an ontological force- 
the race, for instance, which unfolds in history. In both cases the 
individual tends to be treated as an instrument of the organic reality.

When the reactionary response is thus bolstered by an intellectual 
defense, the characteristics of that defense are explicable only 
in terms of the basic attitudes of unanalyzed reaction. Reaction is 
rooted in a perception of tradition as a whole. It is a total situation 
that is defended: the "good old days". There is no selectivity; 
even the questionable features of the past are defended. The point 
is that the reactionary, for whatever motive, perceives himself to 
have been part or a partner of something that extended beyond himself, 
something which, consequently, he was not able to accept or reject 
on the basis of subjective preference. The reactionary is confused about 
the existential status of a decaying tradition, but he does perceive 
the unity tradition had when it was healthy.

All of which brings up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic 
insight in a literary work. Is the Oedipus complex, the clinical 
syndrome, material for a tragedy? If we remove ourselves for a moment 
from our time and our infatuation with mental disease, isn't there 
something absurd about a hero in a novel who is defeated by his infantile 
neurosis? I am not making a clinical judgment here, for such 
personal tragedies are real and are commonplace in the analyst's 
consulting room, but literature makes a different claim upon our sympathies 
than tragedy in life. A man in a novel who is defeated in his childhood 
and condemned by unconscious forces within him to tiredly repeat 
his earliest failure in love, only makes us a little weary of man; 
his tragedy seems unworthy and trivial.   Now we can argue that 
the irresistible fate of Oedipus Rex was nothing more than the irresistible 
unconscious longings of Oedipus projected outward, but this 
externalization of unconscious conflict makes all the difference between 
a story and a clinical case history. We can also argue that the 
three brothers Karamazov and Smerdyakov were the external representatives 
of an internal conflict within one man, Dostoevsky, a conflict 
having to 
do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father's woman. But 
a novel in which one man Karamazov explored the divisions within 
his personality would scarcely merit publication in the <Psychoanalytic 
Quarterly>.   It is a mistake to look upon the Oedipus of 
Oedipus Complex as a literary descendant of Oedipus Rex. Whatever 
the psychological truth in the Oedipus myth, an Oedipus who is drawn 
to his fate by irresistible external forces can carry the symbol of 
humanity and its archaic crime, and the incest that is unknowing renews 
the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorbs us in the 
secret. But a modern Oedipus who is doomed because he cannot oppose 
his own childhood is only pathetic, and for renouncing the mystery 
in favor of psychological truth he gives up the claim on our sympathies.

I am suggesting that a case-history approach to the Oedipus 
complex is a blind alley for a storyteller. The best gifts of the novelist 
will be wasted on the reader who is insulated against any surprises 
the novelist may have in store for him. Incest is still a durable 
theme, but if it wants to get written about it will have to find ways 
to surprise the emotions, and there is no better way to do this than 
that of concealment and symbolic representation. And the best way to 
conceal and disguise the elements of an incest story is not to set out 
to write an incest story. Which brings to mind another Lawrence story 
and some interesting comparisons in the treatment of the Oedipal 
theme.   "The Rocking Horse Winner" is also a story about 
a boy's love for his mother. If I now risk some comparisons with 
<Sons and Lovers> let it be clear that I am not comparing the two 
works or judging their merits; I am only singling out differences 
in treatment of a theme and the resultant effects. "The Rocking Horse 
Winner" is a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the 
reader- but we do not know why. It is the story of the hopeless love 
of a little boy for his cold and vain mother. There are ghostly scenes 
in which the little boy on his rocking horse rocks madly toward the 
climax that will magically give him the name of the winning horse. The 
child grows rich on his winnings and conspires with his uncle to make 
secret gifts of his money to his mother. The story ends in the child's 
illness and delirium brought on by the feverish compulsion to 
ride his horse to win for his mother. The child dies with his mourning 
mother at his bedside.   I had read the story many times without 
asking myself why it affected me or caring why it did. But on one 
occasion when I encountered a similar fantasy in a little boy who was 
my patient I began to understand the uncanny effects of this story. 
It was, of course, a little boy's fantasy of winning his mother to 
himself, and replacing the father who could not give her the things she 
wanted- a classical oedipal fantasy if you like- but if it were 
only this the story would be banal. Why does the story affect us? How 
does the rocking exert its uncanny effect upon the reader? The 
rocking is actually felt in the story, a terrible and ominous rhythm that 
prophesies the tragedy. The rocking, I realized, is the single element 
in the story that carries the erotic message, the unspoken and 
unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child's fantasy 
and disturb the effects of the work if it were made explicit. The 
rocking has the ambiguous function of keeping the erotic undercurrent 
silent and making it present; it conceals and yet is suggestive; 
a perfect symbol. And if we understand the rocking as an erotic symbol 
we can also see how well it serves as the symbol of impending tragedy. 
For this love of the boy for his mother is a hopeless and forbidden 
love, doomed by its nature.   We are also struck by the fact 
that this story of a boy's love for his mother does not offend, while 
the incestuous love of the man, Paul Morel, sometimes repels. It's 
easy to see why. This love belongs to childhood; we accord it 
its place there, and in Lawrence's treatment we are given the innocent 
fantasy of a child, in fact, the form in which oedipal love is expressed 
in childhood. And when the child dies in Lawrence's story 
in a delirium that is somehow brought on by his mania to win and to make 
his mother rich, the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such 
a death does not enter into our thoughts at all. We have so completely 
entered the child's fantasy that his illness and his death are the 
plausible and the necessary conclusion.   I am sure that none 
of the effects of this story were consciously employed by Lawrence to 
describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood. It is most probable that 
Freud and the Oedipus complex never entered his head in the writing 
of this story. He was simply writing a story that wanted to be told, 
and in the writing a childhood fantasy of his own emerged. He would not 
have cared why it emerged, he only wanted to capture a memory to play 
with it again in his imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the 
story the disturbing emotions that accompanied the fantasy.   In 
our own time we have seen that the novelist's debt to psychoanalysis 
has increased but that the novel itself has not profited much from 
this marriage. Ortega's hope that modern psychology might yet bring 
forth a last flowering of the novel has only been partially fulfilled. 
The young writer seems intimidated by psychological knowledge; he 
has lost confidence in his own eyes and in the validity of his own psychological 
insights. He borrows the insights of psychology to improve 
his impaired vision but cannot bring to his work the distinctive vision 
that should be a novelist's own. He has been seduced by the marvels 
of the unconscious and has lost interest in studying the surfaces 
of character. If many of the characters in contemporary novels appear 
to be the bloodless relations of characters in a case history it is 
because the novelist is often forgetful today that those things that 
we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior, that the ego 
is still the executive agency of personality, and that all we know of 
personality must be discerned through the ego. The novelist who has 
been badly baptized in psychoanalysis often gives us the impression that 
since all men must have an Oedipus complex all men must have the 
same faces. #/2,.#

I have argued that Oedipus of the Oedipus 
complex has a doubtful future as a tragic figure in literature. But a 
writer who has a taste for irony and who sees incest in all its modern 
dimensions can let his imagination work on the disturbing joke in the 
incest myth, the joke that strikes right at the center of man's humanness. 
Moral dread is seen as the other face of desire, and here psychoanalysis 
delivers to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem 
of great complexity.   There is probably some significance 
in the fact that two of the best incest stories I have encountered 
in recent years are burlesques of the incest myth. The ancient types 
are reassembled in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly drawn to their 
destinies, but the myth fails before the modern truth; the oracle 
speaks false and the dream speaks true. In both the farmer's tale 
in Ralph Ellison's <Invisible Man> and in Thomas Mann's <The 
Holy Sinner>, the incest hero rises above the myth by accepting 
the wish as motive; the heroic act is the casting off of pretense.

Thomas Mann wrote <The Holy Sinner> in 1951. It was conceived 
as a leave-taking, a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myths 
of the West, "<bevor die Nacht sinkt, eine lange Nacht vielleicht 
und ein tiefes Vergessen>". He chose a medieval legend of 
incest, Gregorius vom Stein, and freely borrowed and parodied other 
myths of the West, mixing themes, language, peoples and times in a master 
myth in which the old forms continually renew themselves, as in his 
previous treatment of Joseph.   But <The Holy Sinner> is 
not simply a retelling of old stories for an old man's entertainment. 
Mann understood better than most men the incest comedy at the center 
of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread is shown as 
the other face as longing was for him just the kind of deep and complicated 
joke he liked to tell. And when he retold the legend of Gregorius 
he interpolated a modern version in which the medieval players speak 
contemporary thoughts in archaic language; while they move through 
the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through 
not-knowing, they reveal the unconscious motive in seeking each other 
and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the 
twentieth-century manner.   Grigorss is the child of an incestuous 
union between a royal brother and sister, the twins Sibylla and 
Wiligis. He is born in secrecy after the death of his father and cast 
adrift soon after birth. The infant is discovered by a fisherman who 
brings him home to rear him. An ivory tablet in the infant's cask 
recounts the story of his sinful origins and is preserved for the child 
by the monks of a monastery in the fishing village. Grigorss, at 
seventeen, learns his story and goes forth as a knight to uncover his 
origins. His sailing vessel is guided by fate to the shores of his own 
country at a time when Sibylla's domain is overrun by the armies 
of one of her rejected suitors. Grigorss overcomes the suitor in battle, 
delivers the city from its oppressors and marries Sibylla who had 
fallen in love with the beautiful knight the moment she saw him.

Sibylla is pregnant with their second child when she finds the ivory 
tablet concealed by her husband, and the identities of mother and son 
are revealed. Grigorss goes off to do penance on a rock for seventeen 
years. At the end of this period two pious Christians in Rome receive 
the revelation which leads them to seek the next Pope on the rock. 
Grigorss comes to Rome and becomes a great and beloved Pope. In 
the last pages of the book Sibylla comes to Rome to seek an audience 
with the great Pope and to give her confession. Mother and son recognize 
each other and, in Mann's version of this legend, make a remarkable 
confession of guilt to each other, the confession of unconscious 
motive and unconscious knowledge of their true identities from the 
time they had first set eyes on each other. 
In recollection he has said: "Natural or man-made objects kept coming 
into my head, but I would suppress them sternly". Moreover, 
he organized the movement of his forms, within his rigorously shaped space, 
into highly complex equilibriums; and used gradations of color 
value as well as sharply contrasting elementary colors.   The worthy 
Mondrian, seeing these pictures, said in a tone of kindly reproof: 
"But you are really an artist of the naturalistic tradition"! 
Helion did not realize it at the time, but it was true.   His 
"monumental" abstraction, made up of smooth, metallic "non-objects" 
acting upon each other with great tension, won Helion much 
acclaim during the 'thirties. The play of novel lighting effects also 
entered into these compositions, whose controlled power and varied 
activity made them well worth meditating.   As Helion's work 
showed more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature, the pure 
abstractionists expressed some disapproval; but Leger, Arp, Lipchitz 
and Alexander Calder, at the time, gave him their blessing. His 
canvases nowadays bore titles frankly declaring them to be "Figures 
in Space", or "Blue Figure", or "Pink Figure"; and 
they had (vaguely) heads and feet. Exhibited in shows in London in 
1935, and in New York the following year, the new, more elaborated 
abstracts were much favored in the circles of the modernists as three-dimentional 
dramas of great intellectual coherence. At this period 
the thirty-year old Helion was ranked "as one of the mature leaders 
of the modern movement", according to Herbert Read, "and in the 
direct line of descent from Cezanne, Seurat, Gris and Leger". In 
America, Meyer Schapiro observed that, unlike the Mondrian school, 
Helion "sought a return path to the fullness of nature within the 
framework of abstract art".   It is notable that at this time 
he was writing with admiration of Cimabue's and Poussin's way 
of filling space. Abstract art was still the right path for him; but, 
he 
held, instead of continuing as an "art of reduction", it must grow, 
must make a place for the contributions of the Raphaels and Poussins 
as well as for those of the early cubists and Mondrian.   Later 
Helion wrote of this phase: "For years I built for myself 
a subtle instrument of relationships- colors and forms without a name. 
I played on it my secret songs, unexplained, passionate and peaceful".

But his own work was evolving further. The extreme limitations 
he sensed in all current abstract art made that seem to him increasingly 
arid and cold. He was engaged in constant experiments that 
searched for new directions. Where would it all lead? He himself 
did not know, as he said in 1935. But he was "afraid of the future- 
he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration, a functional 
art of some kind".   During the 1920's the Abstractionists, 
the German Bauhaus group of industrial designers, and the new 
architects all had the dream of some well ordered utopia, or welfare 
state, in which their neat and logical constructions might find their 
proper place. But whereas the postwar American abstractionists seem 
to Helion to be determined to "escape" from the real world, or simply 
to rebel against it, the <ordered> abstractions which he and his 
associates of the 1930's were painting embodied the hope of "improving" 
things. "We were possessed by visions of a new civilization 
to come, very pure and elevated", he has said, "in fact some ideal 
form of socialism such as we had dreamed of since the war of 1914-1918".

Instead of this the 1930's witnessed a tragic economic 
depression, the rise of Fascist dictators in Europe, the wasting 
Civil War in Spain. Very much the political man, Helion felt himself 
deeply affected by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of France 
and all Europe, whose foundations seemed to him more and more shaky. 
In 1936 he decided to migrate to America. The Rooseveltian America 
was a haven of liberalism and progress and seemed to him to constitute 
the last best hope for civilization. Helion also hoped that 
America's mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be 
accompanied by the production of new and beautiful art works. "I arrived 
in the United States with the idea of establishing myself there 
more or less permanently and finding inspiration for new compositions".

In New York he was well received by what was then only 
a small brave band of non-figurative artists, including Alexander Calder, 
George K& L& Morris, De Kooning, Holty and a few others. 
After a year in a studio on Sheridan Square, having married an 
American girl who was a native of Virginia, Helion moved to a village 
in the Blue Ridge mountains, where he produced some of the most 
imposing of his abstract canvases.   The darkening world scene, 
at the time of the Munich Pact, continued to trouble his mind even in 
his remote Virginia studio. "Fear possessed me, and the certainty 
of war", he has related. "I truly smelled blood, death, heaps of 
corpses everywhere". In haste he labored to finish some last abstract 
paintings: a three-panel frieze, with a flying figure and a fallen 
figure; a "Double-Figure", which went to the Chicago Art 
Institute, and is considered by him the most successful of his abstracts; 
and in early 1939, a "Fallen Figure" of very ominous character, 
which concluded his abstract phase. "I knew I was carrying 
on with abstraction to its very end- for me", he said of the two 
years' output in Virginia. With those paintings of big constructions 
crashing down, he felt he could stop. They were, in effect his last 
testament to non-objective art.   He had taken out first papers 
for American citizenship; but after war came to Europe, he decided 
to return to France, arriving there in January, 1940. "I hated 
the war", he said, "but thought I ought to go because I was, perhaps, 
one of those who hadn't done enough to prevent it". ## 

In June, 1940, Sergeant Helion, with a company of reserve troops waiting 
to go into battle, was sketching the hills south of the Loire 
River, when the war suddenly rolled in upon him. Its first apparition 
was a long, gloomy column of refugees riding in farm wagons, or pushing 
prams. His company then carried out a confused retreating movement 
until it was surrounded by the Germans, a few days before France capitulated. 
After a sort of death march during four days without food, 
Helion and his comrades were shipped by cattle-car to a labor camp 
at an estate farm in East Germany. A year later they were removed to 
a Stalag in the harbor of Stettin. At the time of his capture Helion 
had on his person a sketchbook he had bought at Woolworth's in 
New York. When he was stripped, deloused and numbered by his guards, 
his much-thumbed sketchbook was seized and thrown on a pile of prisoners' 
goods to be confiscated. "It was then I knew that they were 
making war against Man, the individual within!- who questioned 
things when given orders".   At Stettin the university-educated 
artist, who had studied German, was chosen to serve as interpreter 
and clerk in the office of the Stalag commander. In secret he also 
acted as a member of the prisoners' Central Committee, which plotted 
sabotage, planned a few escapes, and maintained a hidden control over 
the wretched French slave-laborers.   In the Stalag, Helion 
came to know and love his comrades, most of them plain folk, who, in 
their extremity, showed true courage and ran great risks to help each 
other. How much they esteemed him is shown by the fact that their underground 
committee selected him as one of the few who would be helped 
to escape. In the prison camp's Black Market civilian clothes were 
quietly bought and forged papers were devised for him; during long 
weeks the plan for his flight was rehearsed.   Every morning 
contingents of prisoners would be sent out to labor in nearby factories. 
One evening, while a volley-ball game was being played in the yard 
among the prisoners remaining there, a simulated melee was staged- 
just as the gates were opened to admit other prisoners returning from 
work. As Helion wrote afterward: "  Their sentry followed 
**h Four hands were stretched toward me by my comrades behind me. Marquet 
held my briefcase; Finot held a wallet with my money and papers; 
Moineau and David held nothing but their fingers **h They felt 
rough and kind and warm. At this moment the volley-ball hit the ground. 
Duclos ran toward Desprez with fists raised. The guards all 
rushed up to intervene **h"   Shedding his prison cloak, Helion 
shot through the gates, now clad in civilian garments and with the 
passport of a Flemish worker. Riding trains, hitching hikes on trucks 
across Germany, slipping through guarded frontiers with the help of 
secret guides, he eventually reached Vichy France, and, by the winter 
of 1943, was back in Virginia. He wrote: "  To escape from 
a prison camp required a very special state of mind; not only loathing 
of captivity, but a faith, a hope that is even stronger. I left 
behind me brave men, whom captivity had robbed of all hope. They too 
loved their families, longed for their villages: yet lacked the faith 
that drove one to dare **h the fearful chance of escape". 
It was a time of revelations for him. Even the most rational of men, 
under great stress, may be transported by a new faith and behave like 
mystics. Helion knew that he owed his freedom as much to the self-sacrifice 
of his fellow-men in Arbeitskommando /13,, Stettin, as to 
his own fierce 
will and love of life. After that, he declared, "to return to 
freedom was to fall to one's knees before the real world and adore 
it". In prison he had been able to sketch nothing but figures from 
life, his guards, his companions in misery. Now all his desires centered 
on "rediscovering and singing of the prosaic and yet beautiful 
world of men and objects so long barred from me by a barbed wire fence". 
And, he added: "During the many months in prison camp, all 
abstract images vanished from my mind".   Before leaving for America, 
he happened to see his old friend Jean Arp and confided to 
him his new resolutions. Arp protested: "But it is impossible! 
Everything in the way of representation has already been done by the 
old masters". Helion, however, clung to the belief that "in escaping 
from the Stalag I had also escaped from Abstraction".

While convalescing in his Virginia home he wrote a book recording 
his prison experiences and escape, entitled: <They Shall Not Have 
Me> **h Published originally in (Helion's) English by Dutton 
+ Co& of New York, in 1943, the book was received by the press 
as a work of astonishing literary power and one of the most realistic 
accounts of World War /2, from the French side. It was very widely 
read, too; and the author, who seemed the embodiment of France's 
rising spirit of resistance to her conquerors, was much complimented 
for his daring military action. But when he showed his new figurative 
pictures to his artist friends of the abstract camp, they paid him 
no compliments and drew long faces.   Between 1944 and 1947 Helion 
had a series of one-man shows- at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery 
in New York and in Paris- of his new realistic pictures. They reincarnated 
the figures of human beings banished from his canvases since 
the 1920's. These new pictures focussed on the familiar and commonplace 
objects that he had heard the men in his prison camp talking 
about as the things they missed most, hence associated with the sense 
of lost freedom: the cafe at the corner, the newspaper kiosk, the girls 
in doorways and windows along the street, the golden-crusted French 
bread they lacked, the cigarettes denied them. One of the pictures 
was of a man with hat drawn over his face ceremoniously lighting a cigarette; 
others were of men doffing their hats to each other, carrying 
umbrellas with pomp, reading newspapers, or simply showing loaves of 
bread spread out.

Important as was Mr& O'Donnell's essay, his thesis is 
so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has. 
He and also Mr& Cowley and Mr& Warren have fallen to the temptation 
which besets many of us to read into our authors- Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, for example, and Herman Melville- protests against 
modernism, material progress, and science which are genuine protests of 
our own but may not have been theirs. Faulkner's total works today, 
and in fact those of his works which existed in 1946 when Mr& Cowley 
made his comment, or in 1939, when Mr& O'Donnell wrote his 
essay, reveal no such simple attitude toward the South. If he is a 
traditionalist, he is an eclectic traditionalist. If he condemns the 
recent or the present, he condemns the past with no less force. If he 
sees the heroic in a Sartoris or a Sutpen, he sees also- and he 
shows- the blind and the mean, and he sees the Compson family disintegrating 
from within. If the barn-burner's family produces a Flem 
Snopes, who personifies commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic 
crassness, the Compson family produces a Jason Compson /4,. Faulkner 
is a most untraditional traditionalist.   Others writing on 
Faulkner have found the phrase "traditional moralist" either inadequate 
or misleading. Among them are Frederick J& Hoffman, William 
Van O'Connor, and Mrs& Olga Vickery. They have indicated 
the direction but they have not been explicit enough, I believe, in 
pointing out Faulkner's independence, his questioning if not indeed 
challenging the Southern tradition. Faulkner's is not the mind 
of the apologist which Mr& O'Donnell implies that it is. He is 
not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body 
of social, cultural, or literary traditions than he was within the traditions- 
or possibly the regulations- governing his tenure in the 
post office at Oxford, Mississippi, thirty-five years ago.   That 
is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions, of course, that 
he is steeped in them, in fact, or that he has dealt with them, in 
his books. It is to say rather, I believe, that he has brought to bear 
on the history, the traditions, and the lore of his region a critical, 
skeptical mind- the same mind which has made of him an inveterate 
experimenter in literary form and technique. He has employed from 
his section rich immediate materials which in a loose sense can be termed 
Southern. The fact that he has cast over those materials the light 
of a skeptical mind does not make him any the less Southern, I rather 
think, for the South has been no more solid than other regions except 
in the political and related areas where patronage and force and 
intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity. Some of us might 
be inclined to argue, in fact, that an independence of mind and action 
and an intolerance of regimentation, either mental or physical, 
are particularly Southern traits.   There is no necessity, I suppose, 
to assert that Mr& Faulkner is Southern. It would not be 
easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree than that of his 
family. And, after all, he has lived comfortably at both Oxford, Mississippi, 
and Charlottesville, Virginia. The young William Faulkner 
in New Orleans in the 1920's impressed the novelist Hamilton 
Basso as obviously conscious of being a Southerner, and there is no 
evidence that since then he has ever considered himself any less so. 
Besides showing no inclination, apparently, to absent himself from his 
native region even for short periods, and in addition writing a shelf 
of books set in the region, he has handled in those books an astonishingly 
complete list of matters which have been important in the South 
during the past hundred years.   It is more difficult with Faulkner 
than with most authors to say what is the extent and what is 
the source of his knowledge. His own testimony is that he has read very 
little in the history of the South, implying that what he knows of 
that history has come to him orally and that he knows the world around 
him primarily from his own unassisted observation. His denials of extensive 
reading notwithstanding, it is no doubt safe to assume that he 
has spent time schooling himself in Southern history and that he has 
gained some acquaintance with the chief literary authors who have lived 
in the South or have written about the South. To believe otherwise 
would be unrealistic.   But in looking at Faulkner against 
his background in Mississippi and the South, it is important not to 
lose the broader perspective. His earliest work reflected heavy influences 
from English and continental writers. Evidence is plentiful that 
early 
and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic romancers, 
who deal in extravagant horror, to the symbolists writing at the end 
of the preceding century, and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness 
novelists, Henry James and James Joyce among them. His repeated 
experimentation with the techniques of fiction testifies to an independence 
of mind and an originality of approach, but it also shows him 
touching at many points the stream of literary development back of him. 
My intention, therefore, is not to say that Faulkner's awareness 
has been confined within the borders of the South, but rather that 
he has looked at his world as a Southerner and that presumably his outlook 
is Southern.   The ingredients of Faulkner's novels and 
stories are by no means new with him, and most of the problems he takes 
up have had the attention of authors before him. A useful comment 
on his relation to his region may be made, I think, by noting briefly 
how in handling Southern materials and Southern problems he has deviated 
from the pattern set by other Southern authors while remaining 
faithful to the essential character of the region.   The planter 
aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton 
Kennedy published <Swallow-Barn> in 1832 and in his genial portrait 
of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated 
the most persistent tradition of Southern literature. The thoroughgoing 
idealization of the planter society did not come, however, 
until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend 
a way of life which had been destroyed. As they looked with nostalgia 
to a society which had been swept away, they were probably no more 
than half-conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed. 
Their books found no less willing readers outside than inside the 
South, even while memories of the war were still sharp. The tradition 
reached its apex, perhaps, in the works of Thomas Nelson Page toward 
the end of the century, and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 
in the best-selling novel <So Red the Rose>, by Stark Young. 
Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition, 
he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize 
the planter society.   The myth of the Southern plantation 
has had only a tangential relation with actuality, as Francis 
Pendleton Gaines showed forty years ago, and I suspect it has had a 
far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed. 
Faulkner has found it useful, but he has employed it with his 
habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook. Without saying or 
seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families 
Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism, we can say nevertheless 
that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the 
planter dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil 
War. It may be that in this comment he has broken from the conventional 
pattern more violently than in any other regard, for the treatment 
in his books is far removed from even the genial irony of Ellen 
Glasgow, who was the only important novelist before him to challenge 
the conventional picture of planter society.   Faulkner's low-class 
characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels 
dealing with plantation life. They have an ancestry extending back, 
however, at least to 1728, when William Byrd described the Lubberlanders 
he encountered in the back country of Virginia and North Carolina. 
The chief literary antecedents of the Snopes clan appeared in the 
realistic, humorous writing which originated in the South and the 
Southwest in the three decades before the Civil War. These narratives 
of coarse action and crude language appeared first in local newspapers, 
as a rule, and later found their way between book covers, though 
rarely into the planters' libraries beside the morocco-bound volumes 
of Horace, Mr& Addison, Mr& Pope, and Sir Walter Scott. 
There is evidence to suggest, in fact, that many authors of the humorous 
sketches were prompted to write them- or to make them as indelicate 
as they are- by way of protesting against the artificial refinements 
which had come to dominate the polite letters of the South. William 
Gilmore Simms, sturdy realist that he was, pleaded for a natural 
robustness such as he 
found in his favorites the great Elizabethans, 
to vivify the pale writings being produced around him. Simms admired 
the raucous tales emanating from the backwoods, but he had himself social 
affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully. Augustus 
Baldwin Longstreet, a preacher and a college and university president 
in four Southern states, published the earliest of these backwoods 
sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle, in the accounts of 
sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat, and in the shockingly 
unliterary speech of his characters, he set an example followed 
by many after him.   Others who wrote of low characters and low 
life included Thomas Bangs Thorpe, creator of the Big Bear of Arkansas 
and Tom Owen, the Bee-Hunter; Johnson Jones Hooper, whose 
character Simon Suggs bears a close kinship to Flem Snopes in 
both his willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the 
sharpness with which he habitually carried out his will; and George 
Washington Harris, whose Tennessee hillbilly character Sut Lovingood 
perpetrated more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain 
than any other character in literature. It would be profitable, I believe, 
to read these realistic humorists alongside Faulkner's works, 
the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything 
to them directly, but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with 
a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our 
time, to Faulkner's time. Such a comparison reminds us that in employing 
low characters in his works Faulkner is recording actuality 
in the South and moreover is following a long-established literary precedent. 
Such characters, with their low existence and often low morality, 
produce humorous effects in his novels and tales, as they did in 
the writing of Longstreet and Hooper and Harris, but it need not be 
added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions than 
they had in the earlier writers; nor is there need to add that among 
them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful 
of his characters.   One of the early humorists already mentioned, 
Thomas Bangs Thorpe, can be used to illustrate another point 
where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier 
literary treatment of those materials. Thorpe came to Louisiana from 
the East as a young man prepared to find in the new country the setting 
of romantic adventure and idealized beauty. But Thorpe saw also 
the hardships of pioneer existence, the cultural poverty of the frontier 
settlements, and the slack morality which abounded in the new regions. 
As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and 
feelings, he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips 
and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble, Arkansas, 
where no one had ever seen a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece 
of frontier humor, "The Big Bear of Arkansas", in which 
earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods 
tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the 
mysteries of nature.

SOME years ago Julian Huxley proposed to an audience made 
up of members of the British Association for the Advancement of 
Science that "man's supernormal or extra-sensory faculties are [now] 
in the same case as were his mathematical faculties during the ice 
age". As a Humanist, Dr& Huxley interests himself in the possibilities 
of human development, and one thing we can say about this 
suggestion, which comes from a leading zoologist, is that, so far as he 
is concerned, the scientific outlook places no rigid limitation upon 
the idea of future human evolution.   This text from Dr& Huxley 
is sometimes used by enthusiasts to indicate that they have the permission 
of the scientists to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment 
of psychic powers in human beings. There may be a case of this sort, 
but it is not one we wish to argue, here. Even if people do, in a 
not far distant future, begin to read one another's minds, there will 
still be the question of whether what you find in another man's mind 
is especially worth reading- worth more, that is, than what you can 
read in good books. Even if men eventually find themselves able to 
look through walls and around corners, one may question whether this 
will help them to live better lives. There would be side-conclusions 
to be drawn, of course; such capacities are impressive evidence pointing 
to a conception of the human being which does not appear in the accounts 
of biologists and organic evolutionists; but the basic puzzles 
of existence would still be puzzling, and we should still have to work 
out the sort of problems we plan to discuss in this article.

All we want from Dr& Huxley's statement is the feeling that this 
is an open world, in the view of the best scientific opinion, with 
practically no directional commitments as to what may happen next, and 
no important confinements with respect to what may be possible.

It seems quite obvious that all the really difficult tasks of human 
beings arise from the fact that man is not one, but many. Each man, 
that is, is both one and many. He is a dreamer of the good society with 
a plan to put into effect, and he is an individual craftsman with 
something to make for himself and the people of his time. He is a parent 
with a child to nurture, here and now, and he is an educator who worries 
about the children half way round the world. He is a utopian with 
a stake in tomorrow and he is a vulnerable human made captive by the 
circumstances of today. He can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and 
he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself. He is a Craig's wife who agonizes 
about tobacco ash on the living room rug and he is a forgetful 
genius who goes boating with the town baker when dignitaries from the 
local university have come to call. He is the stern guardian of the status 
quo who has raised the utilitarian structures of the age, and he 
is the revolutionary poet with a gun in his hand who writes a tragic 
apologetic to posterity for the men he has killed.   What will be 
the final symmetry of the good society? For what do the utopians 
labor? Here, on a desk, is a stack of pamphlets representing the efforts 
of some of the best men of the day to penetrate these questions. 
The pamphlets are about law, the corporation, forms of government, the 
idea of freedom, the defense of liberty, the various lethargies which 
overtake our major institutions, the gap between traditional social 
ideals and the working mechanisms that have been set in motion for their 
realization. The thing that is notable in all these discussions is 
the lack of ideological ardor. There is another kind of ardor, a quiet, 
sure devotion to the fundamental decencies of human life, but no 
angry utopian contentions. Actually, you could wish for some passion, 
now and then, but when you look around the world and see the little volcanos 
of current history which partisan social passions have wrought, 
you are glad that in these pamphlets there is at least some civilized 
calm.   You could also say that in these pamphlets is a relieving 
quality of maturity. There is essential pleasantness in reading the 
writing of men who are not angry, who can contend without quarreling. 
This is the good kind of sophistication, and with all our problems 
and crises this kind of sophistication has flowered in the United States 
during recent years. A characteristic expression of such concern 
and inquiry is found in Joseph P& Lyford's introduction to <The 
Agreeable Autocracies,> a recent paperback study of the institutions 
of modern democratic society. Mr& Lyford gives voice to a temper 
that represents, we think, an achieved plateau of reflective thinking. 
After casting about for a way of describing this spirit, we decided 
that it would be better to use Mr& Lyford's introduction as 
an illustration. He begins: "  At one time it seemed as if 
the Soviet Union had done us a favor by providing a striking example 
of how not to behave towards other peoples and other nations. As 
things turned out, however, we have not profited greatly from the lesson: 
instead of persistently following a national program of our own 
we have often been satisfied to be against whatever Soviet policy seemed 
to be at the moment. Such activity may or may not have irritated 
the Kremlin, but it has frequently condemned America to an unnatural 
defensiveness that has undermined our effort to give leadership to the 
free world.   The defensiveness has been exaggerated by another 
bad habit, our tendency to rate the "goodness" or "badness" 
of other nations by the extent to which they applaud the slogans we circulate 
about ourselves. Since the slogans have little application to 
reality and are sanctimonious to boot, the applause is faint even in areas 
of the world where we should expect to find the greatest affection 
for free government. Shocked at the response to our proclamations, 
we grow more defensive, and worse, we lose our sense of humor and proportion. 
Mr& Nehru is subjected to stern lectures on neutralism by 
our Department of State, and an American President observes sourly 
that Sweden would be a little less neurotic if it were a little more 
capitalistic".   One thing you can say about Mr& Lyford is 
that he does not suffer from any insecurity as an American. Those 
who are insecure fear to be candid in self-examination. Only the strong 
look squarely at weakness. The maturity in this point of view lies 
in its recognition that no basic problem is ever solved without being 
clearly understood. Mr& Lyford continues: "  Even if the 
self portrait we distribute for popular consumption were accurate it 
would be dangerous to present it as a picture of the ideal society. We 
would be ignoring the special circumstances of other countries. The 
picture is the more treacherous when it misrepresents the facts of American 
life. The discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what 
we practice or tolerate is great, and it does not escape the notice 
of others. If our sincerity is granted, and it is granted, the discrepancy 
can only be explained by the fact that we have come to believe 
hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understanding 
gained by earnest self-examination. What is more, the legends have become 
so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism 
smells of low treason, and men who practice it are defeatists and 
unpatriotic scoundrels.   **h although we continue to pay our 
conversational devotions to "free private enterprise", "individual 
initiative", "the democratic way", "government of the people", 
"competition of the marketplace", etc&, we live rather comfortably 
in a society in which economic competition is diminishing in 
large areas, bureaucracy is corroding representative government, technology 
is weakening the citizen's confidence in his own power to make 
decisions, and the threat of war is driving him economically and physically 
into the ground".   The interesting thing about Mr& 
Lyford's approach, and the approach of the contributors to <The 
Agreeable Autocracies> (Oceana Publications, 1961) to the situation 
of American civilization, is that it is concerned with comprehending 
the psychological relationships which are having a decisive effect 
on American life. In an ideological argument, the participants tend 
to thump the table. They are determined to <prove> something. The 
new spirit, so well illustrated by Mr& Lyford's work, is wholly 
free of this anxiety. The problem is rather to find out what is actually 
happening, and this is especially difficult for the reason that "we 
are busily being defended from a knowledge of the present, sometimes 
by the very agencies- our educational system, our mass media, our 
statesmen- on which we have had to rely most heavily for understanding 
of ourselves". The Introduction continues: "  We experience 
a vague uneasiness about events, a suspicion that our political 
and economic institutions, like the genie in the bottle, have escaped 
confinement and that we have lost the power to recall them. We feel 
uncomfortable at being bossed by a corporation or a union or a television 
set, but until we have some knowledge about these phenomena and 
what they are doing to us, we can hardly learn to control them. It does 
not appear that we will be delivered from our situation by articles 
on The National Purpose.   <The Agreeable Autocracies> 
is an attempt to explore some of the institutions which both reflect 
and determine the character of the free society today. The men who 
speculate on these institutions have, for the most part, come to at least 
one common conclusion: that many of the great enterprises and associations 
around which our democracy is formed are in themselves autocratic 
in nature, and possessed of power which can be used to frustrate 
the citizen who is trying to assert his individuality in the modern 
world".   These institutions which Mr& Lyford names "agreeable 
autocracies"- where did they come from? Of one thing we 
can be sure: they were not sketched out by the revolutionary theorists 
of the eighteenth century who formulated the political principles 
and originally shaped the political institutions of what we term the "free 
society". No doubt there are historians who can explain to a 
great extent what happened to the plans and projects of the eighteenth 
century. Going back over this ground and analyzing the composition 
of forces which have created the present scene is one of the tasks undertaken 
by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, in 
Santa Barbara. But however we come, finally, to explain and account 
for the present, the truth we are trying to expose, right now, is that 
the makers of constitutions and the designers of institutions find 
it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host 
of all their enterprises. The host is the flowing life of the human race. 
This life has its own currents and rhythms, its own multiple cycles 
and adaptations. On occasion it produces extraordinary novelties. 
Should Rousseau have been able to leave room in his social theory 
for the advent of television, atomic energy, and ~IBM machines? 
How would Thomas Jefferson feel after reading <Factories in the 
Field?> They tell us, sir, that we are free, because we have in one 
hand a ballot, and in the other a stock certificate. With these we 
shape our destiny and own private property, and that, sir, makes ours 
the best of all possible societies. The reality of the situation, however, 
is described by Mr& Lyford: "  Many of us may even 
be secretly relieved at having a plausible excuse to delegate ancient 
civic responsibilities to a new bureaucracy of experts. Thus the member 
of an industrial union comes to regard his officers as business 
agents who may proceed without interference or recall; the stockholder 
delivers his proxy; and the citizen narrows his political participation 
to the mere act of voting- if he votes at all". 
Copernicus did not question it, Ptolemy could not. Given the conceptual 
context within which ancient thought thrived, how could anyone have 
questioned this principle? The reasons for this are partly observational, 
partly philosophical, and reinforced by other aesthetic and 
cultural factors.   First, the observational reasons. <The> obvious 
natural fact to ancient thinkers was the diurnal rotation of the 
heavens. Not only did constellations like Draco, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia 
spin circles around the pole, but stars which were not circumpolar 
rose and set at the same place on the horizon each night. Nor did 
a constellation's stars vary in brightness during the course of their 
nocturnal flights. The conclusion- the distances of the constellations 
did not vary and their paths were circular. Moreover, the sun's 
path over earth described a segment of a great circle; this was 
clear from the contour of the shadow traced by a gnomon before and after 
noon.   As early as the /6,th century B&C& the earth 
was seen to be spherical. Ships disappear hull-first over the horizon; 
approaching shore their masts appeared first. Earth, being at 
the center of the universe, would have the same shape as the latter; 
so, e&g& did Aristotle argue, although this may not be an <observational> 
reason in favor of circularity. The discoid shapes of 
sun and moon were also felt to indicate the shape of celestial things.

In light of all this, one would require <special> reasons for 
saying that the paths of the heavenly bodies were other than circular. 
Why, for example, should the ancients have supposed the diurnal rotation 
of the heavens to be elliptical? Or oviform? Or angular? 
There were no reasons for such suppositions then. This, conjoined 
with the considerations above, made the circular motions of heavenly 
bodies appear an almost directly observed fact.   Additional philosophical 
considerations, advanced notably by Aristotle, supported further 
the circularity principle. By distinguishing superlunary (celestial) 
and sublunary (terrestrial) existence, and reinforcing this with 
the four-element physics of Empedocles, Aristotle came to speak of 
the stars as perfect bodies, which moved in only a perfect way, viz& 
in a perfect circle.   Now what is perfect motion? It must, 
apparently, be motion without termini. Because motion which begins and 
ends at discrete places would (e&g& for Aristotle) be incomplete. 
Circular motion, however, since it is eternal and perfectly continuous, 
lacks termini. It is never motion towards something. Only imcomplete, 
imperfect things move towards what they lack. Perfect, complete 
entities, if they move at all, do not move towards what they lack. 
They move only in accordance with what is in their natures. Thus, circular 
motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely 
perfect celestial existence.   To return now to the four-element 
physics, a mixture of muddy, frothy water will, when standing in 
a jar, separate out with earth at the bottom, water on top, and the 
air on top of that. A candle alight in the air directs its flame and 
smoke upwards. This gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements. 
Thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe. It is covered (partly) 
with water, air is atop of that. Pure fire (the stars) is in 
the heavens. When combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms 
of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material 
substratum, it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a 
scale of material-formal ratios, celestial bodies will be of a subtle, 
quickened, ethereal existence, in whose embodiment pure form will be 
the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary.

The stars constitute an order of existence different from what 
we encounter on earth. This is clear when one distinguishes the types 
of motion appropriate to both regions. A projectile shot up from earth 
returns rectlinearly to its 'natural' place of rest. But the 
natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest, nor rectilinear 
motion. Being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake 
more of what is divine. Their motion will be eternal and perfect.

Let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between Ptolemaic 
and Copernican astronomy. Bluntly, there never was a Ptolemaic <system> 
of astronomy. Copernicus' achievement was to have <invented> 
systematic astronomy. The <Almagest> and the <Hypotheses> outline 
Ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational 
tables, independent calculating devices for the prediction 
of future planetary perturbations. Indeed, in the Halma edition of Theon's 
presentation of the <Hypotheses> there is a chart setting 
out (under six distinct headings) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing 
the planetary motions. No attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld 
into a single scheme (<a la> Aristotle), these independent predicting-machines. 
They all have this in common: the earth is situated 
near the center of the deferent. But that one should superimpose all 
these charts, run a pin through the common point, and then scale each 
planetary deferent larger and smaller (to keep the epicycles from 'bumping'), 
this is contrary to any intention Ptolemy ever expresses. 
He might even suppose the planets to move at infinity. Ptolemy's 
problem is to forecast where, against the inverted bowl of night, some 
particular light will be found at future times. His problem concerns 
longitudes, latitudes, and angular velocities. The distances of these 
points of light is a problem he cannot master, beyond crude conjectures 
as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth. 
But none of this has prevented scientists, philosophers, and even 
historians of science, from speaking of the Ptolemaic <system,> in 
contrast to the Copernican. This is a mistake. It is engendered by 
confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in the <Almagest> with the 
geocentric astronomy.   Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could 
ever <explain> planetary motion. This is what necessitates the nonsystematic 
character of his astronomy. So when textbooks, like that 
of Baker set out drawings of the 'Ptolemaic System', complete 
with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged 
on their several deferents, we have nothing but a misleading /20,th-century 
idea of what never existed historically.   It is 
the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations 
are <interdependent>. He cannot, e&g& compute the retrograde 
arc traveled by Mars, without also making suppositions about the 
earth's own motion. He cannot describe eclipses without entertaining 
some form of 
a three-body problem. In Ptolemaic terms, however, eclipses 
and retrograde motion were <phenomena simpliciter,> to be explained 
directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations. In a 
<systematic> astronomy, like that of Copernicus, retrogradations become 
part of the conceptual structure of the system; they are no longer 
a puzzling aspect of intricately variable, local planetary motions.

Another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic vs& 
Copernican astronomy, turns on the idea of <simplicity>. It is often 
stated that Copernican astronomy is 'simpler' than Ptolemaic. 
Some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of 
the former. Thus, Margenau remarks: "A large number of unrelated 
epicycles was needed to explain the observations, but otherwise the 
[Ptolemaic] system served well and with quantitative precision. Copernicus, 
by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe, 
was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen. 
Historical records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the 
fundamental aspects of his so-called 'revolution', unaware perhaps 
of its historical importance, he rested content with having produced 
a <simpler> scheme for prediction. As an illustration of the principle 
of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because 
it allows simplicity to be arithmetized; it involves a reduction 
in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen".

Without careful qualification this can be misleading. If in any one 
calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles <all at once,> 
while Copernicus never required more than one third this number, then 
(in the sense obvious to Margenau) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler 
than Copernican. But no single planetary problem ever required 
of Ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time. This, of course, results 
from the non-systematic, 'cellular' character of Ptolemaic 
theory. Calculations within the Copernican framework always raised questions 
about planetary configurations. These could be met only by considering 
the dynamical elements of several planets at one time. This 
is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces 
his isolated problems. Thus, in no ordinary sense of 'simplicity' 
is the Ptolemaic theory simpler than the Copernican. The latter required 
juggling several elements simultaneously. This was not simpler 
but much more difficult than exercises within Ptolemy's astronomy.

Analogously, anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of 
gravitation is simpler than Newton's, must say rather more to explain 
how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists, while 
the former can be managed (with difficulty) only by accomplished experts.

In a sense, Einstein's theory <is> simpler than Newton's, 
and there is a corresponding sense in which Copernicus' theory 
is simpler than Ptolemy's. But 'simplicity' here refers to 
<systematic simplicity>. The number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple 
theories is reduced to a minimum. The axioms required to 
make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully, 
so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced 
rigorously back to these axioms, rules, and primitive notions. This 
characterizes Euclid's formulation of geometry, but not Ptolemy's 
astronomy. There are in the <Almagest> no rules for determining 
<in advance> whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with 
abberations in lunar, solar, or planetary behavior. The strongest 
appeal of the Copernican formulation consisted in just this: ideally, 
the justification for dealing with special problems in particular 
ways is completely set out in the basic 'rules' of the theory. The 
lower-level hypotheses are never 'ad hoc', never introduced <ex 
post facto> just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum. 
Copernicus, to an extent unachieved by Ptolemy, approximated to 
Euclid's vision. <De Revolutionibus> is not just a collection of 
facts and techniques. It is an organized system of these things. Solving 
astronomical problems requires, for Copernicus, not a random search 
of unrelated tables, but a regular employment of the rules defining 
the entire discipline.   Hence, noting the simplicity achieved 
in Copernicus' formulation does not provide <another> reason for 
the acceptance of <De Revolutionibus,> another reason beyond its 
systematic superiority. It provides exactly <the same> reason.

1543 A&D& is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific 
revolution. It is really the funeral day of scholastic science. Granted, 
the cosmological, philosophical, and cultural reverberations 
initiated by the <De Revolutionibus> were felt with increasing violence 
during the 300 years to follow. But, considered within technical 
astronomy, a different pattern can be traced.   In what does the 
dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist? What in the 
<Almagest> draws his fire? Geocentricism <per se?> No. The 
formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being Copernicus' 
<primary> concern, was introduced only to resolve what seemed 
to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy, namely, the 'unphysical' 
triplication of centric reference-points: one center from which 
the planet's distances were calculated, another around which planetary 
velocities were computed, and still a third center (the earth) from 
which the observations originated. This arrangement was for Copernicus 
literally monstrous: "With [the Ptolemaists] it is as though 
an artist were to gather the hands, feet, head and other members 
for his images from divers models, each part excellently drawn, but not 
related to a single body; and since they in no way match each other, 
the result would be a monster rather than a man".   Copernicus 
required a systematically integrated, physically intelligible astronomy. 
His objective was, essentially, to repair those aspects of orthodox 
astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends. 
That such deficiencies existed within Ptolemy's theory was not 
discovered <de novo> by Copernicus. The critical, rigorous examinations 
of Nicholas of Cusa and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context 
(a late medieval context) for Nicholas Copernicus' own work. 
The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies. Without abandoning 
too much, Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically 
and mechanically acceptable. He did not think himself to be 
firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution. 
Henrietta's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam was crowned by her 
discovery of the coincidence that Sara's epitaph in the Jewish 
cemetery in Venice referred to her as "the Sulamite".   Into 
the texture of this tapestry of history and human drama Henrietta, 
as every artist delights to do, wove strands of her own intuitive insights 
into human nature and- 
especially in the remarkable story of the 
attraction and conflict between two so disparate and fervent characters 
as this pair- into the relations of men and women: "In their 
relations, she was the giver and he the receiver, nay the demander. His 
feeling always exacted sacrifices from her. **h One is so accustomed 
to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive, and 
women as submissive and yielding, that our sympathies are usually enlisted 
on the side of the man whose love is not returned, and we condemn 
the woman as a coquette **h. The very firmness of her convictions and 
logical clearness of her arguments captivated and stimulated him to 
make greater efforts; usually, this is most exasperating to men, who 
expect every woman to verify their preconceived notions concerning her 
sex, and when she does not, immediately condemn her as eccentric and 
unwomanly **h. She had the opportunity that few clever women can resist, 
of showing her superiority in argument over a man **h. Women themselves 
have come to look upon matters in the same light as the outside 
world, and scarcely find any wrong in submitting to the importunities 
of a stronger will, even when their affections are withheld **h. 
She was exposing herself to temptation which it is best to avoid where 
it can consistently be done. One who invites such trials of character 
is either foolhardy, overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith 
in mankind to see the danger. In any case but the last, such a course 
is sure to avenge itself upon the individual; the moral powers 
no more than the physical and mental, can bear overstraining. And, in 
the last case, a bitter disappointment but too often meets the confiding 
nature **h".   Henrietta was discovering in the process of 
writing, as the born writer does, not merely a channel for the discharge 
of accumulated information but a stimulus to the development of the 
creative powers of observation, insight and intuition.   Dr& 
Isaacs was so pleased with the quality of her biographical study of 
Sara Sullam that he considered submitting it to the <Century> Magazine 
or <Harper's> but he decided that its Jewish subject probably 
would not interest them and published it in <The Messenger,> 
"so our readers will be benefited instead". Under her father's 
influence it did not occur to Henrietta that she might write on subjects 
outside the Jewish field, but she did begin writing for other Anglo-Jewish 
papers and thus increased her output and her audience. And 
she wrote the libretto for an oratorio on the subject of Judas Maccabeus 
performed at the <Hanukkah> festival which came in December. 
By her eighteenth birthday her bent for writing was so evident that 
Papa and Mamma gave her a <Life of Dickens> as a spur to her aspiration.

Another source of intellectual stimulus was opened 
to her at that time by the founding of Johns Hopkins University within 
walking distance of home. It was established in a couple of buildings 
in the shopping district, with only a few professors, but all eminent 
men, and a few hundred eager students housed in nearby dwellings. 
In September '76 Thomas Huxley, Darwin's famous disciple, came 
from England to speak in a crowded auditorium at the formal opening 
of the University; and although it was a school for men only, it 
afforded Henrietta an opportunity to attend its public lectures.

In the following year her father undertook to give a course in Hebrew 
theology to Johns Hopkins students, and this brought to the Szold 
house a group of bright young Jews who had come to Baltimore to 
study, and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma and entertained 
by Henrietta and Rachel, who played and sang for them in the upstairs 
sitting room on Sunday evenings. From Philadelphia came Cyrus 
Adler and Joseph 
Jastrow. Adler, Judge Sulzberger's nephew, came to study Assyriology. 
A smart, shrewd and ambitious young man, well connected, and with 
a knack for getting in the good graces of important people, he was 
bound to go far. Joseph Jastrow, the younger son of the distinguished 
rabbi, Marcus Jastrow, was a friendly, round-faced fellow with a 
little mustache, whose field was psychology, and who was also a punster 
and a jolly tease. His father was a good friend of Rabbi Szold, and 
Joe lived with the Szolds for a while. Both these youths, who greatly 
admired Henrietta, were somewhat younger than she, as were also 
the neighboring Friedenwald 
boys, who were then studying medicine; 
and bright though they all were, they could not possibly compete for 
her interest with Papa, whose mind- although he never tried to dazzle 
or patronize lesser lights with it- naturally eclipsed theirs and 
made them seem to her even younger than they were. Besides, Miss Henrietta- 
as she was generally known since she had put up her hair 
with a chignon in the back- had little time to spare them from her 
teaching and writing; so Cyrus Adler became interested in her friend 
Racie Friedenwald, and Joe Jastrow- the only young man who when 
he wrote had the temerity to address her as Henrietta, and signed 
himself Joe- fell in love with pretty sister Rachel.   Henrietta, 
however, was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with 
Joe's older and more serious brother, Morris, who was just about 
her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to Philadelphia 
with Papa, when he substituted for Rabbi Jastrow at Rodeph 
Shalom Temple there during its Rabbi's absence in Europe. Young 
Morris, who, while attending the University of Pennsylvania, also 
taught and edited a paper, found time to write Henrietta twenty-page 
letters on everything that engaged his interest, from the acting of Sarah 
Bernhardt in Philadelphia to his reactions to the comments of 
"Sulamith" on the Jewish reform movement being promulgated by the 
Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Unlike his younger brother, 
Joe, he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as "My 
dear friend", although he praised and envied the elegance and purity 
of her style. And when he complained of the lack of time for all 
he wanted to do, Henrietta advised him to rise at five in the morning 
as she and Papa did.   One thing Papa had not taught Henrietta 
was how to handle a young man as high-spirited and opinionated as 
herself. She could not resist the opportunity "of showing her superiority 
in argument over a man" which she had remarked as one of the 
"feminine follies" of Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, 
Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness 
"to think of men as the privileged" and "women as submissive 
and yielding", felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers 
to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception- he objected 
to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms 
of Dr& Wise of Hebrew Union College- until once, in sheer 
desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree 
on anything. But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters, 
or from coming to spend his Christmas vacations with the hospitable, 
lively Szolds in their pleasant house on Lombard Street. 

#1880S: 
"LITTLE WOMEN"#

"WE'VE GOT Father and Mother 
and each other **h" said Beth on the first page of Louisa Alcott's 
<Little Women;> and, "I do think that families are the 
most beautiful things in all the world", burst out Jo some five hundred 
pages later in that popular story of the March family, which had 
first appeared when Henrietta was eight; and the Szold family, as 
it developed, bore a striking resemblance to the Marches.   Mr& 
March, like Benjamin Szold, was a clergyman, although of an indeterminate 
denomination; and "Marmee" March, like Sophie Szold, 
was the competent manager of her brood of girls, of whom the Marches 
had only four to the Szolds' five. But the March girls had their 
counterparts in the Szold girls. Henrietta could easily identify 
herself with Jo March, although Jo was not the eldest sister. Neither 
was Henrietta hoydenish like Jo, who frankly wished she were a 
boy and had deliberately shortened her name, which, like Henrietta's, 
was the feminine form of a boy's name. But both were high-spirited 
and vivacious, both had tempers to control, both loved languages, 
especially English and German, both were good teachers and wrote for 
publication. Each was her mother's assistant and confidante; and 
each stood out conspicuously in the family picture.   Bertha Szold 
was more like Meg, the eldest March girl, who "learned that a 
woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling 
it, not as a queen, but a wise wife and mother". Bertha, blue-eyed 
like Mamma, was from the start her mother's daughter, destined for 
her mother's role in life. Sadie, like Beth March, suffered ill 
health- got rheumatic fever and had to be careful of her heart- 
but that never dampened her spirits. When her right hand was incapacitated 
by the rheumatism, Sadie learned to write with her left hand. She 
wrote gay plays about the girls for family entertainments, like "Oh, 
What Fun! A comedy in Three Acts", in which, under "Personages", 
Henrietta appeared as "A Schoolmarm", and Bertha, 
who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school than Henrietta 
had been, appeared as "<Dummkopf>". Sadie studied piano; played 
Chopin in the "Soiree Musicale of Mr& Guthrie's Pupils"; 
and she recited "Hector's Farewell to Andromache" most 
movingly, to the special delight of Rabbi Jastrow at his home in Germantown 
near Philadelphia, where the Szold girls took turns visiting 
between the visits of the Jastrow boys at the Szolds' in Baltimore. 
Adele, like Amy, the youngest of the Marches, was the rebellious, 
mischievous, rather calculating and ambitious one. For Rachel, 
conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls- and she did make 
a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her guitar and singing 
in her silvery tones- there was no particular March counterpart; 
but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences 
the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere 
if not entirely in content- the one being definitely Jewish 
and the other vaguely Christian.   The Szolds, like the Marches, 
enjoyed and loved living together, even in troubled times; and, 
as in the March home, any young man who called on the Szolds found 
himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult 
to direct his particular attention to any one of them. This 
included Mamma, jolly, generous, and pretty, with whom they all fell 
in love, just as Papa had first fallen in love with <her> Mamma before 
he chose her; and when a young man like Morris Jastrow had enjoyed 
the Szold hospitality, he felt obliged to send his respects and 
his gifts not merely to Henrietta, in whom he was really interested, 
but to all the Szold girls and Mamma. And just as "Laurie" Lawrence 
was first attracted to bright Jo March, who found him immature 
by her high standards, and then had to content himself with her younger 
sister Amy, so Joe Jastrow, who had also been writing Henrietta 
before he came to Johns Hopkins, had to content himself with her 
younger sister, pretty Rachel. And like Jo March, who saw her sisters 
Meg and Amy involved in "lovering" before herself, Henrietta 
saw her sisters Rachel and Sadie drawn outside their family circle 
by the attraction of suitors, Rachel by Joe Jastrow, and Sadie by 
Max Lo^bl, a young businessman who would write her romantic descriptions 
of his trips by steamboat down the Mississippi.

This time he was making no mistake. Olgivanna- in her country 
the 
nickname was a respectful form of address- was not only attractive but 
shrewd, durable, sensible, and smart. No wonder Wright was enchanted- 
no two better suited people ever met. Almost from that day, until 
his death, Olgivanna was to stay at his side; but the years that 
immediately followed were to be extraordinarily trying, both for Wright 
and his Montenegrin lady.   It must be granted that the flouting 
of convention, no matter how well intentioned one may be, is sure 
to lead to trouble, or at least to the discomfort that goes with social 
disapproval. Even so, many of the things that happened to Wright 
and Olgivanna seem inordinately severe. Their afflictions centered 
on one maddening difficulty: Miriam held up the divorce proceedings 
that she herself had asked for. Reporters began to trail Miriam everywhere, 
and to encourage her to make appalling statements about Wright 
and his doings. Flocks of writs, attachments, and unpleasant legal 
papers of every sort began to fly through the air. The distracted Miriam 
would agree to a settlement through her legal representative, then 
change her mind and make another attack on Wright as a person. At 
last her lawyer, Arthur D& Cloud, gave up the case because she 
turned down three successive settlements he arranged. Cloud made an interesting 
statement in parting from his client: "I wanted to be 
a lawyer, and Mrs& Wright wanted me to be an avenging angel. So I 
got out. Mrs& Wright is without funds. The first thing to do is 
get her some money by a temporary but definite adjustment pending a final 
disposition of the case. But every time I suggested this to her, 
Mrs& Wright turned it down and demanded that I go out and punish 
Mr& Wright. I am an attorney, not an instrument of vengeance". 
Miriam Noel disregarded the free advice of her departing counselor, 
and appointed a heavy-faced young man named Harold Jackson to take 
his place.   There were three years of this strange warfare; 
and during the unhappy time, Miriam often would charge that Wright and 
Olgivanna were misdemeanants against the public order of Wisconsin. 
Yet somehow, when officers were prodded into visiting Taliesin to 
execute the warrants, they would find neither Wright nor Olgivanna 
at home. This showed that common sense had not died out at the county 
and village level- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced 
woman was not restrained remains a puzzle. The misery of Miriam's 
bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case- it was 
hopeless, agonizing, and destructive, with Miriam herself bearing the 
heaviest burden of shame and pain.   To get an idea of the embarrassment 
and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna, we 
should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person. 
One of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring 
Green toward the end of the open warfare, on a beautiful day in June. 
At this time Miriam Noel appeared, urging on Constable Henry Pengally, 
whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers 
in the neighborhood. A troop of reporters brought up the rear. Miriam 
was stopped at the Taliesin gate, and William Weston, now the 
estate foreman, came out to parley. He said that Mr& Wright was 
not in, and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant 
that Miriam was waving in the air. Miriam now ordered Pengally to 
break down the gate, but he said he really couldn't go that far. At 
this point Mrs& Frances Cupply, one of Wright's handsome daughters 
by his first wife, came from the house and tried to calm Miriam 
as she tore down a NO VISITORS sign and smashed the glass pane 
on another sign with a rock.   Miriam Noel Wright said, "Here 
I am at my own home, locked out so I must stand in the road"! 
Then she rounded on Weston and cried, "You always did Wright's 
dirty work! When I take over Taliesin, the first thing I'll 
do is fire you".   "Madame Noel, I think you had better 
go", said Mrs& Cupply.   "And I think <you> had better 
leave", replied Miriam. Turning to the reporters, she asked, "Did 
you hear her? 'I think you had better leave'! And this 
is my own home". In the silence that followed, Miriam walked close 
to Mrs& Cupply, who drew back a step on her side of the gate. Then, 
with staring eyes and lips drawn thin, Miriam said to the young woman, 
"You are ugly- uglier than you used to be, and you were always 
very ugly. You are even uglier than Mr& Wright".   The 
animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a 
natural force; and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that 
of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art. 
As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement 
at all, Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him; she 
also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William 
Norris of Nebraska, the Fighting Liberal, from whose office a sympathetic 
but cautious harrumphing was heard. Then, after overtures to 
accept a settlement and go through with a divorce, Miriam gave a ghastly 
echo of Mrs& Micawber by suddenly stating, "I will never leave 
Mr& Wright".   Under this kind of pressure, it is not 
surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers. 
Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly, but one 
can feel the generalized anger in Wright's remarks to reporters 
when he was asked, one morning on arrival in Chicago, what he thought 
of the city as a whole. First, Wright said, he was choked by the smoke, 
which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town. But surely 
Michigan Avenue was handsome? "That isn't a boulevard, it's 
a racetrack"! cried Wright, showing that automobiles were considered 
to be a danger as early as the 1920's. "This is a horrible 
way to live", Wright went on. "You are being strangled by traffic". 
He was then asked for a solution of the difficulty, and began 
to talk trenchant sense, though private anguish showed through in the 
vehemence of his manner. "Take a gigantic knife and sweep it over 
the Loop", Wright said. "Cut off every building at the seventh 
floor. Spread everything out. You don't need concentration. If 
you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams. 
You'll have trees again. You'll have some joy in the life of 
this city. After all, that's the job of the architect- to give 
the world a little joy".

Little enough joy was afforded Wright 
in the spring of 1925, when another destructive fire broke out at Taliesin. 
The first news stories had it that this blaze was started by 
a bolt of lightning, as though Miriam could call down fire from heaven 
like a prophet of the Old Testament. A storm did take place that 
night, and fortunately enough, it included a cloudburst that helped put 
out the flames. Later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting 
the fire; at any rate, heat grew so intense in the main part of the 
house that it melted the window panes, and fused the K'ang-si pottery 
to cinders. Wright set his loss at $200,000, a figure perhaps justified 
by the unique character of the house that had been ruined, and 
the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and 
other things that were destroyed. In spite of the disaster, Wright 
completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort, in which 
he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees- a project of 
great and appropriate charm, that came to nothing. Amid a shortage of 
profitable work, the memory of Albert Johnson's $20,000 stood out 
in lonely grandeur- the money had quickly melted away. A series of 
conferences with friends and bankers began about this time; and the 
question before these meetings was, here is a man of international reputation 
and proved earning power; how can he be financed so that he 
can find the work he ought to do? While this was under consideration, 
dauntless as ever Wright set about the building of Taliesin /3,.

As he made plans for the new Taliesin, Wright also got on 
paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation 
of all faiths, and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping 
ramp. Years were to pass before these plans came off the paper, and 
Wright was justified in thinking, as the projects failed, that much 
of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except 
by visitors to Taliesin. And now there was some question as to 
his continued residence there. Billy Koch, who had once worked for 
Wright as a chauffeur, gave a deposition for Miriam's use that he 
had seen Olgivanna living at Taliesin. This might put Wright in such 
a bad light before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin; 
nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing out that if he 
was not "compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills, useless 
hotel bills, and useless doctor's bills", he could more quickly 
provide Miriam with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris, 
as she preferred. Miriam sniffed at this, and complained that Wright 
had said unkind things about her to reporters. His reply was, "Everything 
that has been printed derogatory to you, purporting to have 
come from me, was a betrayal, and nothing yet has been printed which 
I have sanctioned". What irritated Miriam was that Wright had told 
the papers about a reasonable offer he had made, which he considered 
she would accept "when she tires of publicity". From her California 
headquarters, Miriam fired back, "I shall never divorce Mr& 
Wright, to permit him to marry Olga Milanoff".   Then Miriam 
varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing 
a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending, and asking 
for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, with the understanding that Wright 
would not contest it. The Bank of Wisconsin sent a representative 
to the judge's chambers in Madison to give information on Wright's 
ability to meet the terms. He said that the architect might reasonably 
be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment 
could be brought to an end, and that the bank would accept a mortgage 
on Taliesin to help bring this about. Miriam said that she must be 
assured that "that other woman, Olga, will not be in luxury while I 
am scraping along". This exhausted Wright's patience, and in consequence 
he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite. "Volstead 
laws, speed laws, divorce laws", he said, "as they now 
stand, demoralize the individual, make liars and law breakers of us in 
one way or another, and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd. 
If Mrs& Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning, I'll 
go either to Tokyo or to Holland, to do what I can. I realize, 
in taking this stand, just what it means to me and mine". Here Wright 
gave a slight sigh of weariness, and continued, "It means more 
long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people, 
making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding 
as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me". Next 
day, word came that Miriam was not going through with the divorce; 
but Wright stayed in the United States. His mentioning of Japan and 
Holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking. No matter 
what troubles might betide him, this most American of artists knew 
in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land.

In a few weeks Miriam made another sortie at Taliesin, but 
was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates. 
More likely, you simply told yourself, as you handed us the book, that 
it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline 
of incantation.   For pride's sake, I will not say that 
the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into 
my soul. Besides, that particular message does no more than weakly echo 
the roar in all fresh blood. But what you could not know, of course, 
was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American 
Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents 
were to come, if not of age, then into a bright, taut semblance of it. 
I do not suppose you ever heard of F& Scott Fitzgerald, living 
or dead, and moreover I do not suppose that, even if you had, his legend 
would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval. 
Neither his appetites, his exacerbations, nor his despair were 
kin to yours. He might have been the man in the moon for all you could 
have understood him. But he was no man in the moon to me. Although 
his tender nights were not the ones I dreamed of, nor was it for yachts, 
sports cars, tall drinks, and swimming pools, nor yet for money or 
what money buys that I burned, I too was burning and watching myself 
burn. The flame was simply of a different kind. It was symbolized 
(at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image) by that 
self-consuming, elegiac candle of Edna St& Vincent Millay's, 
that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a 
beacon to us, but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall 
as a funeral taper to last even the evening, let alone the night. One 
should not, of course, pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume 
to linger on. Yet this passion for passion, now that I look back 
on it with passion spent, seems somewhat overblown and operatic, though 
as a diva Miss Millay perfectly controlled her notes. Only what 
else was she singing but the old Song of Songs, that most ancient 
of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves? 
Perhaps this is not so little. Perhaps the mere fact that by 
plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us, temporarily 
anyway, the sleeping poet, and in poets can discover their 
immortality, is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to 
which we can attest? One can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone 
casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives 
for a lover or a friend; one can take it as no more than another 
veil torn from the mystery of the soul. But it could also be looked 
at from the other end of the spectrum. One could see this chemical determinant 
as in itself a miracle. In any case, Miss Millay's sweet-throated 
bitterness, her variations on the theme that the world was 
not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love, her constant 
and wonderfully tragic posture, so unlike that of Fitzgerald since 
it required no scenery or props, drew from the me that I was when 
I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea.   But all this, I 
am well aware, is the <bel canto> of love, and although I have always 
liked to think that it was to the <bel canto> and to that alone 
that I listened, I know well enough that it was not. If I am to speak 
the whole truth about my knowledge of love, I will have to stop 
trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale. There is another side 
of love, more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie, 
or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug.   Whether 
you experienced the passion of desire I have, of course, no way 
of knowing, nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment 
of a wish to know, for the fact that one constitutes by one's 
mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any 
speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest, 
more scandalizing, more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from 
a stranger. I recoil from the very thought. At the same time, I am 
aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves 
at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign, since theirs is a science 
of paradox: if one hates, they say it is because one loves; 
if one bullies, they say it is because one is afraid; if one shuns, 
they say it is because one desires; and according to them, whatever 
one fancies one feels, what one feels in fact is the opposite. Well, 
normally abnormal or normally normal, neurotic or merely fastidious (do 
the tea-leaf readers, by the way, allow psyches to have moral taste?), 
I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion. ##

YOU 
PROBABLY WOULD NOT REMEMBER, SINCE YOU NEVER seemed to remember 
even 
the same moments as I, much less their intensity, one sunny midday on 
Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping 
less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance 
at the Farm. I can see us now. We had been walking quite briskly, 
for despite your being so small and me so tall, your stride in those 
days could easily match mine. We had stopped before a shop window 
to assess its autumnal display, when you suddenly turned to me, looking 
up from beneath one of your wrong hats, and with your nervous "ahem"! 
said: "There are things I must tell you about this man you 
are marrying which he does not know himself". If you had screamed 
right there in the street where we stood, I could not have felt more 
fear. With scarcely a mumble of excuse, I fled. I fled, however, 
not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise 
from you that the things about my bridegroom- in the sense you 
meant the word "things"- which you had been galvanizing yourself 
to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which 
I had already insisted upon finding out for myself (despite, I may now 
say, the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle, 
yes, on principle, and in cold blood) because I was resolved, as 
a modern woman, not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize 
Life by the throat. I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid 
of self-betrayal. What I fled from was my fear of what, unwittingly, 
you might betray, without meaning to, about my father and yourself.

But I can see from this latest trick of memory how much 
more arbitrary and influential it is than the will. While my memory 
holds with relentless tenacity, as I cannot too often stress, to my wrongs, 
when it comes to my shames, it gestures and jokes and toys with 
chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from 
them. Just as I was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside 
of the leaf of love, memory, displeased at being asked to yield its 
unsavory secrets, dashed ahead of me, calling back over its shoulder: 
"Skip it. Cut it out". But I will not skip it or cut it 
out. 
It is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless 
victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings 
of chance. If to be innocent is to be helpless, then I had been- 
as are we all- helpless at the start. But the time came when I was 
no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless. Helpless in that 
sense I can never be again. However, I confess my hope that I 
will be innocent again, not with a pristine, accidental innocence, but 
rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh 
to reach the bone.   For innocence, of all the graces of the 
spirit, is I believe the one most to be prayed for. Although it is constantly 
made to look foolish (too simple to come in out of the rain, 
people say, who have found in the innocent an impediment), it does not 
mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks. 
It assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best, and when 
they seem worst it overlooks them. To innocence, a word given is a word 
that will be kept. Instinctively, innocence does unto others as it 
expects to be done by. But when these expectations are once too often 
ground into the dust, innocence can falter, since its strength is according 
to the strength of him who possesses it. The innocence of which 
I speak is, I know, not incorruptible. But I insist upon believing 
that even when it is lost, it may, like paradise, be regained.

However, it was not of innocence in general that I was speaking, 
but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of 
it which is innocence in romantic love. Here, if anywhere, it is not 
wholly incontrovertible. To you, for instance, the word innocence, in 
this connotation, probably retained its Biblical, or should I say 
technical sense, and therefore I suppose I must make myself quite clear 
by saying that I lost- or rather handed over- what you would 
have considered to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled, 
and in fact by oath required, to hand it over along with what other 
goods and bads I had. But to me innocence is far less tangible. 
I had long since begun to lose my general innocence when I lost my 
trust in you, but this special innocence I lost before ever I loved, 
through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience 
a flaming delight that had nothing, nothing whatever to do with 
friendship or liking, let alone with love. I knew this knowledge to 
be corrupting at the time I acquired it; today, these many years later, 
after all the temptations resisted or yielded to, the weasel satisfactions 
and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured, I call it 
corrupting still.   You, I could swear to it, remained innocent 
in this sense until the end. Yours, but not mine, was an age in which 
innocence was fostered and carefully- if not perhaps altogether 
innocently- preserved. You had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing 
mark of a lady was the <noli me tangere> writ plain across 
her face. Moreover, because of the particular blot on your family 
escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your 
grandmother's part, and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle 
bed of your childhood to outgrow, what you obviously most desired 
with both your conscious and unconscious person, what you bent your 
whole will, sensibility, and intelligence upon, was to be a lady. Before 
being daughter, wife, or mother, before being cultured (a word now 
bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen 
bestowed on it), before being sorry for the poor, progressive 
about public health, and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian, 
indeed first and foremost, you were a lady. There was, of course, 
more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than 
the <sine qua non> of her virtue. A lady, you made clear to me both 
by precept and example, never raised her voice or slumped in her chair, 
never failed in social tact (in heaven, for instance, would not mention 
St& John the Baptist's head), never pouted or withdrew or 
scandalized in company, never reminded others of her physical presence 
by unseemly sound or gesture, never indulged in public scenes or private 
confidences, never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering, 
never gossiped or maligned, never stressed but always minimized 
the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself. 
With each song he gave verbal footnotes. The songs Sandburg sang often 
reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely 
or in fragments. Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons 
who had similar ballads or ditties. In due time Sandburg was 
a walking thesaurus of American folk music.   After he had finished 
the first two volumes of his <Lincoln>, Sandburg went to work 
assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the 
memory of songs others had taught him. He rummaged, found composers 
and arrangers, collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization 
with musicians, ballad singers, and musicologists.   The 
result was a collection of 280 songs, ballads, ditties, brought together 
from all regions of America, more than one hundred never before published: 
<The American Songbag>. Each song or ditty was prefaced 
by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the 
song as well as special interest the song had, musical arrangement, 
and most of the chorus and verses.   The book, published in 1927, 
has been selling steadily ever since. As Sandburg said at the time: 
"It is as ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to 
the Appalachian Mountains, it is as modern as skyscrapers, the Volstead 
Act, and the latest oil well gusher". 

#SCHOPENHAUER NEVER LEARNED# 

Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer. Two things 
contribute to his popularity. First, Carl respects his audience and 
prepares his speeches carefully. Even when he is called upon for impromptu 
remarks, he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes. 
He has his own system of shorthand, devised by abbreviations: "humility" 
will be "humly", "with" will be "~w", and "that" 
will be "~tt".   The second reason for his popularity 
is his complete spontaneity with the guitar. It is a mistake, however, 
to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop. He is no dextrous-fingered 
college boy but rather a dedicated, humble, and bashful 
apostle of this instrument. At age seventy-four, he became what he 
shyly terms a "pupil" of Andres Segovia, the great guitarist of 
the Western world.   It is not easy to become Segovia's pupil. 
One needs high talent. Segovia has written about Carl: 
"His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help 
in disciplining them. I found that this precocious, grown-up boy of 
74 deserved to be taught. There has long existed a brotherly affection 
between us, thus I accepted him as my pupil. Just as in the case of 
every prodigy child, we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to 
show up in the future- if he should master all the strenuous exercises 
I inflicted on him.   To play the guitar as he aspires will 
devour his three-fold energy as a historian, a poet and a singer. One 
cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to 
learn the guitar. I am certain that Carl Sandburg will not fall into 
the same sad philosophy. The heart of this great poet constantly bubbles 
forth a generous joy of life- with or without the guitar".

The public's identification of Carl Sandburg and the guitar 
is no happenstance. Nor does Carl reject this identity.   He 
is proud of having Segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him 
titled "The Guitar".   Carl says it is the greatest poem 
ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem 
to that subtle instrument. "A portable companion always ready to 
go where you go- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant- 
to be shared with few or many- just two of you in sweet meditation".

The <New York Herald Tribune's> photographer, 
Ira Rosenberg, tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a 
picture of Carl playing a guitar. Carl hadn't brought his along. Mr& 
Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one.   "Preferably", 
said Carl, "one battered and worn, such as might be found 
in a pawnshop".   They went to the pawnshop of Joseph Miller 
of 1162 Sixth Avenue.   "Mr& Miller was in the shop", 
the <Herald Tribune> story related, "but was reluctant to have 
anybody's picture taken inside, because his business was too 'confidential' 
for pictures.   "But after introductions he asked: 
'Carl Sandburg? Well <you> can pose inside'. 
"He wanted Mr& Sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had 
displayed behind glass in the center of his shop, but the poet eyed this 
somewhat distastefully. 'Kalamazoo guitars', he said, 'used 
by radio hillbilly singers'.   "He chose one from Mr& Miller's 
window, a plain guitar with no fancy polish. While the picture 
was taken, Mr& Miller's disposition to be generous to Mr& 
Sandburg increased to the point where he advised, 'I won't even 
charge you the one dollar rental fee'". 

#A KNOWLEDGEABLE CELEBRITY# 

When someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to 
be a celebrity, Carl said, "A celebrity is a fellow who eats celery 
with celerity".   This has always been Carl's attitude. 
Lloyd Lewis wrote that when he first knew Carl in 1916, Sandburg was 
making $27.50 a week writing features for the <Day Book> and eating 
sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants. He walked home at night 
for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley.   When fame 
came it changed Sandburg only slightly. Lewis remembered another newspaperman 
asking, "Carl, have your ideas changed any since you got 
all these comforts"?   Carl thought the question over slowly 
and answered: "I know a starving man who is fed never remembers 
all the pangs of his starvation, I know that".   That was all 
he said, Lewis reports. That was all he had to say.   In answer 
to a <New York Times> query on what is fame ("Thoughts on 
Fame", October 23, 1960), Carl said: "Fame is a figment of a 
pigment. It comes and goes. It changes with every generation. There 
never were two fames alike. One fame is precious and luminous; another 
is a bubble of a bauble". #"AH, DID YOU ONCE SEE SHELLEY 
PLAIN"?#

The impression you get from Carl Sandburg's home is 
one of laughter and happiness; and the laughter and the happiness are 
even more pronounced when no company is present.   Carl has been 
married to Paula for fifty-three years, and he has not made a single 
major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion 
with his wife. Through all these years, Mrs& Sandburg has pointedly 
avoided the limelight. She has shared her husband's greatness, 
but only within the confines of their home; it is a dedication which 
began the moment she met Carl.   Mrs& Sandburg received a 
Phi Beta Kappa key from the University of Chicago and she was busy 
writing and teaching when she met Sandburg. "You are the 'Peoples' 
Poet'" was her appraisal in 1908, and she stopped teaching 
and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband's 
career.   She has rarely been photographed with him and, except 
for Carl's seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in Chicago in 1953, 
she has not attended the dozens of banquets, functions, public appearances, 
and dinners honoring him- all of this upon her insistence. 
Even now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts.

The only way to describe Paula Sandburg is to say she is 
beautiful in a Grecian sense. Her clothes, her hair, everything about 
her is both graceful and simple. She has small, broad, capable hands 
and an enormous energy.   She is not only a trained mathematician 
and Classicist, but a good architect. She designed and supervised 
the building of the Harbert, Michigan, house, most of which was constructed 
by one local carpenter who carried the heavy beams singly upon 
his shoulder. As the Sandburg goat herd increased, she also designed 
the barn alterations to accommodate them. When erosion threatened 
the foundation of their home in Harbert, Paula Sandburg planted grapevines 
and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away.

She was born Lilian Steichen, her parents immigrants from 
Luxemburg. Her mother called her Paus'l, a Luxemburg endearment 
meaning "pussycat". Some of the children of the family could not 
pronounce this name and called her Paula, a soubriquet Carl liked so 
much she has been Paula ever since.   But neither was Lilian 
her baptismal name. Her parents, pious Roman Catholics, christened 
her Mary Anne Elizabeth Magdalene Steichen. "My mother read a 
book right after I was born and there was a Lilian in the book she 
loved and I became Lilian- and eventually I became Paula".

Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student. This family of Luxemburg 
immigrants, in fact, produced two exceptional children. Paula's 
older brother is Edward Steichen, a talented artist and, for the 
past half-century, one of the world's eminent photographers. (Two 
years ago the photography editor of <Vogue> magazine titled his article 
about Steichen, "The World's Greatest Photographer".)

By the time Lilian had been graduated from public school, her 
parents were doing quite well. Her mother was a good manager and established 
a millinery business in Milwaukee. But her father was not enthusiastic 
about sending young Paula to high school. "This is no 
place for a young girl", he said. The parents compromised, however, 
on a convent school and Paula went to Ursuline Academy in London, 
Ontario.   She was pious, too, once kneeling through the night 
from Holy Thursday to Good Friday, despite the protest of the nuns 
that this was too much for a young girl. She knelt out of reverence 
for having read the <Meditations> of St& Augustine.   She 
read everything else she could get her hands on, including an article 
(she thinks it was in the <Atlantic Monthly>) by Mark Twain on 
"White Slavery". Paula was saddened about what was happening to 
little girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel. She had come to 
a decision. If there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote 
her life to religion, it was now dispelled. "I felt that I must devote 
myself to the 'outside' world".   She passed the entrance 
examinations to the University of Illinois, but during the year 
at Urbana felt more important events transpired at the University 
of Chicago.   "And besides, Thorstein Veblen was one of the 
Chicago professors".   At the University of Chicago she studied 
Whitman and Shelley, and became a Socialist. Socialist leaders 
in Milwaukee recognized her worth, not only because of her dedication 
but because of her fluency in German, French, and Luxemburg. She 
once gave a German recitation before a convention of German-language 
teachers in Milwaukee.   Carl and Paula met in Milwaukee 
in 1907 during Paula's Christmas holiday visit to her parents. Carl 
was still Charles A& Sandburg. He "legitimized" Paula for 
Lilian Steichen, and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles.

Victor Berger, the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and 
member of Congress, had asked Paula Steichen to translate some of 
his German editorials into English. Carl, who was stationed in Appleton, 
Wisconsin, organizing for the Social Democrats, was in Berger's 
office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar. 
She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton, Illinois. 
(After graduation from the University of Chicago, Paula taught 
for two years in the normal school at Valley City, North Dakota, 
then two years at Princeton (Illinois) Township High School.) By 
the time the streetcar pulled away, he had fallen in love with Paula.

A letter awaited her at Princeton. Paula says that even 
though Carl's letters usually began, "Dear Miss Steichen", there 
was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband 
and wife.   Paula generously lent me one of Carl's love 
letters, dated February 21, 1908, Hotel Athearn, Oshkosh, Wisconsin:

"Dear Miss Steichen: It is a very good letter you 
send me- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare I am carrying 
on up here. Never until in this work of ~S-~D organization 
have I realized and felt the attitude and experience of a <Teacher>.

The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet 
Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that 
may lead to peace with justice.   Certainly it is not necessary 
to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in 
the internal affairs of any nation; by the same token, we reject any 
Soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force 
or subversion.   Now this concern for the freedom of other peoples 
is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with 
more than forty other nations in a common defense effort. Not for a 
moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these 
countries; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our 
solemn commitments to them. ##

We and our friends are, of course, 
concerned with self-defense. Growing out of this concern is the realization 
that all people of the Free World have a great stake in the 
progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations. 
These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels 
of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help from, and 
finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their hostility 
to freedom.   But they must have technical and investment assistance. 
This is a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also 
by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide 
help.   In recent years America's partners and friends in 
Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress. 
The international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of 
the early postwar years. No longer is the United States the only major 
industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the 
resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries.

To remain secure and prosperous themselves, wealthy nations must extend 
the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will 
inspire hope, confidence, and progress. A rich nation can for a time, 
without noticeable damage to itself, pursue a course of self-indulgence, 
making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens- 
thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful 
and prosperous society of nations. But the enmities it will incur, 
the isolation into which it will descend, and the internal moral 
and spiritual softness that will be engendered, will, in the long term, 
bring it to economic and political disaster.   America did not 
become great through softness and self-indulgence. Her miraculous progress 
in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy 
and substantial: adherence to principles and methods consonant 
with our religious philosophy; a satisfaction in hard work; the readiness 
to sacrifice for worthwhile causes; the courage to meet every 
challenge; the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the 
true path of her own best interests.   To us and to every nation 
of the Free World, rich or poor, these qualities are necessary today 
as never before if we are to march together to greater security, prosperity 
and peace.   I believe that the industrial countries are 
ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing 
nations to achieve progress.   The immediate need for 
this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's 
international balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign business 
transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the 
expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas, 
to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the 
less developed nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments 
approached four billion dollars.   Continuing deficits of anything 
like this magnitude would, over time, impair our own economic growth 
and check the forward progress of the Free World.   We must 
meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world 
trade. Further, we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free 
World to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less 
fortunate. This co-operation in this matter will provide both for 
the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further 
increases in mutually profitable trade.   New Nations, and 
others struggling with the problems of development, will progress only- 
regardless of any outside help- if they demonstrate faith in their 
own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it. Moreover, 
progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned; 
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. 
But, just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier years, 
so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith 
and determination deserve help.   Respecting their need, one of 
the major focal points of our concern is the South-Asian region. 
Here, 
in two nations alone, are almost five hundred million people, all working, 
and working hard, to raise their standards, and in doing so, to 
make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology 
that would destroy liberty.   I cannot express to you the depth 
of my conviction that, in our own and free world interest, we must co-operate 
with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions, 
as expressed in their different multi-year plans. Through the 
World Bank and other instrumentalities, as well as through individual 
action by every nation in position to help, we must squarely face 
this titanic challenge.   I shall continue to urge the American 
people, in the interests of their own security, prosperity and peace, 
to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and 
cheerfully supported. Free world decisions in this matter may spell the 
difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom.

Other countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar 
needs.   A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations 
which are prepared to assist in the development effort. During the 
past year I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western 
nations.   Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization 
for European Economic Cooperation could help with the initial 
studies needed. The goal is to enlist all available economic resources 
in the industrialized Free World, especially private investment 
capital.   By extending this help, we hope to make possible the 
enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner. 
No more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be 
imagined.   If we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive 
partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have 
already achieved a high state of economic advancement, we will make 
brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom. 
Otherwise, the outlook could be dark indeed. We face, indeed, what 
may be a turning point in history, and we must act decisively and wisely. 
##

As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives 
only from a position of broadly based strength.   No matter how 
earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a high degree 
of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating 
the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually enforceable 
arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the 
means of defending our institutions.   America possesses an enormous 
defense power. It is my studied conviction that no nation will ever 
risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as 
to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support. It is world-wide 
knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack 
the United States by surprise, even though we might sustain great 
losses, would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction. But I once 
again assure all peoples and all nations that the United States, 
except in defense, will never turn loose this destructive power.

During the past year, our long-range striking power, unmatched today 
in manned bombers, has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental 
ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory. In 
fourteen recent test launchings, at ranges of five thousand miles, <Atlas> 
has been striking on an average within two miles of the target. 
This is less than the length of a jet runway- well within the circle 
of destruction. 
Incidentally, there was an <Atlas> firing last 
night. From all reports so far received, its performance conformed to 
the high standards I have just described. Such performance is a great 
tribute to American scientists and engineers, who in the past five 
years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range 
ballistic missiles, where America had none before.   This 
year, moreover, growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will 
enter our active forces, some to be armed with Polaris missiles. These 
remarkable ships and weapons, ranging the oceans, will be capable of 
accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth.   To meet 
situations of less than general nuclear war, we continue to maintain 
our carrier forces, our many service units abroad, our always ready 
Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, and the civilian 
components. The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly 
but necessary process. It is scheduled to go forward at a rate which 
will steadily add to our strength.   The deployment of a portion 
of these forces beyond our shores, on land and sea, is persuasive demonstration 
of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our 
allies for collective security. Moreover, I have directed that steps 
be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to 
these allies. This is necessary for a sounder collective defense system.

Next I refer to our program in space exploration, which 
is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research 
and development.   We note that, first, America has already 
made 
great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of 
knowledge of astrophysics and space science. These discoveries are of 
present interest chiefly to the scientific community; but they are 
important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space 
for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.   Second, our military 
missile program, going forward so successfully, does not suffer from 
our present lack of very large rocket engines, which are necessary 
in distant space exploration. I am assured by experts that the thrust 
of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.

Third, the United States is pressing forward in the development 
of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space 
for exploration purposes.   Fourth, in the meantime, it is necessary 
to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately 
surrounding the earth. Using launch systems presently available, 
we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather; satellite 
relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the 
globe; for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and 
aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the 
data we seek.   Fifth, we have just completed a year's experience 
with our new space law. I believe it deficient in certain particulars. 
Suggested improvements will be submitted to the Congress shortly. 
##

The accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires 
the continuous strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, 
and 
economic sinews of American life. The steady purpose of our society 
is to assure justice, before God, for every individual. We must be 
ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing 
of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the 
issues of the day.   A year ago, when I met with you, the nation 
was emerging from an economic downturn, even though the signs of resurgent 
prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful. 
Today our surging strength is apparent to everyone. 1960 promises 
to be the most prosperous year in our history.   Yet we continue 
to be afflicted by nagging disorders. Among current problems that 
require solutions, participated in by citizens as well as government, 
are:   the need to protect the public interest in situations of 
prolonged labor-management stalemate;   the persistent refusal 
to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of American agriculture;

the continuing threat of inflation, together with 
the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility;   in certain 
instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection 
of the law.

The group, upon the issuance of its first press release on December 
21, 1957, designated itself a "Committee of Investigation". 
In the course of its inquiry, it took testimony from only seven witnesses. 
It heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer, Adolf A& Berle, 
Jr&, once.   Its second press release was on January 15, 
1958, and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed. It also 
implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible.   On 
January 18, Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the U&N& 
lasting an hour. Here, he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred 
to his "aberrant conduct". This conference was held despite 
Stavropoulos' assurance to Adolf Berle, who was leaving the same 
day for Puerto Rico, that nothing would be done until his return on 
January 22, except that the Secretary General would probably order 
the list destroyed.   On January 24 Paul Bang-Jensen, accompanied 
by Adolf Berle, was met by Dragoslav Protitch and Colonel 
Frank Begley, former Police Chief of Farmington, Conn&, and now 
head of U&N& special police.   The four, bundled in overcoats, 
mounted to the wind-swept roof of the U&N&   There, 
Begley lit a fire in a wire basket, and Bang-Jensen dropped four 
sealed envelopes into the flames. In one of these he said were notes 
on the identities of the eighty-one refugees.   The method of destroying 
the evidence embarrassed Paul Bang-Jensen. He knew it would 
be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence. He was 
right, and Peter Marshall could not help but recall Andrew Cordier's 
words on the subject, "Well, it seemed as good a place as any 
to do the job".   The Gross group had been formed for the express 
purpose of advising the Secretary General. Hammarskjold's supposed 
desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross 
is illusion, at best. Gross's being "outside" the U&N& 
applied only to a physical state, not an objective one. But by the 
time the papers were finally disposed of, the group had informed the 
world of its purpose, its recommendations, and its belief that Paul 
Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind.   Shortly the group would issue 
its report to the Secretary General, recommending Paul Bang-Jensen's 
dismissal from the United Nations. The contents of this 
195-page document would become known to many before it would become known 
to the man it was written about. ##

"Until this Hungarian 
Committee matter came up, Bang-Jensen was a fine and devoted individual. 
I had known him for some years, when I was a delegate and before, 
and this manner had never been his".   Ernest A& Gross 
leaned back in his chair and told Peter Marshall how Secretary General 
Dag Hammarskjold had, on December 4,1957, called him in as a 
private lawyer to review Bang-Jensen's conduct "relating to his 
association with the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary". 
The result was the "Gross Report", prepared by Gross, as chairman, 
with the assistance of two U&N& Under Secretaries, Constantin 
Stavropoulos and Philippe de Seynes.   "Yes", Gross 
went on, "Bang-Jensen was an up-and-coming young man. He had 
always done well. Never well known, but he had done his work competently 
**h".   Gross had received Marshall courteously and they 
were discussing the case. "You know", the lawyer said, "it's 
difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back".

Gross was behind a clean-top desk, only a manila folder before 
him. Marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs. Outside the 
office windows, twenty-four stories above Wall Street, a light rain 
was falling.   "Mr& Gross, your report says that 'our 
function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate 
from or prejudice Mr& Bang-Jensen's rights as a staff member'. 
You know, Bang-Jensen characterized your Committee as having prejudged 
his case".   Gross swung his swivel chair. "Well, 
how could that have been? I don't consider that he was prejudged. 
We were given a job and we carried it out, and later, his case was taken 
up by the Disciplinary Committee **h.   "We have nothing 
to hide under a bushel. We did our job, Mr& Stavropoulos and Mr& 
de Seynes and myself, taking evidence from a number of people".

"What did you think about his mental state"?   "I 
think our report sums up our finding", Gross answered. "Don't 
forget, here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost 
a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report **h.

"This was not merely alleging errors, but was carried out 
by day-after-day allegations in memos, written charges of serious consequence 
**h.   "This is a distressing thing. Supposing you or 
I were being accused in this manner, and yet we were doing our level 
best to carry on our work. No organization can carry on like that.

"I've been in government and I can tell some pretty hairy 
stories 
about personnel difficulties, so I know what a problem he was".

"What I'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled 
at your Committee".   "What do you mean"? 
"For instance, regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued 
two interim announcements to the press during its investigation. You 
know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was 'to convey its views, 
suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General'. In his 
own words, Bang-Jensen 'took it for granted that the Group would 
report to the Secretary General privately and not in public'. He 
claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was 'prejudicial 
to his position'".   Gross bristled. For an instant he 
glared speechless at Marshall. "Listen", he said. "I thought 
the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end. 
But you know Bang-Jensen launched an active campaign against us in 
the press. It was getting so that we, the Committee, were being tried. 
You can find it in the papers".   "Well, as a matter of 
fact, I've looked through back-issue files of New York papers for 
December, 1957, and haven't found a great deal"-   Gross 
shot another look at Marshall. "It wasn't necessarily all here 
in New York. Don't forget the foreign press".   "Then 
what about the second interim public announcement? This cited Bang-Jensen's 
'aberrant conduct'".   "The reason for that 
report was to settle the matter of the list. As far as I'm concerned, 
it was a separate matter from the general Committee study of Bang-Jensen's 
conduct. The January fifteen report recommended that 
Bang-Jensen be instructed to burn the list- the papers- in the presence 
of a U&N& Security Officer".   "How about your 
press conference three days later- what was the reason for that? 
Bang-Jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance 
to make sure the term 'aberrant conduct' was not libelous. 
He claimed you made other slanderous allegations".   Gross paused 
and repeated himself. "The entire object of the press conference 
was to clarify the problem of the list, since many in the press were 
querying the U&N& about it. What was the list? I don't know. 
Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that 
he had in his possession.   "It was foolish of him to keep 
them, whatever they were. He could have been blackmailed, or his family 
might have been threatened. Of course the matter caught the public's 
attention. We attempted to conclude this, and did so by having 
the papers burned.   Hammerskjold didn't like the way it was 
carried out. It was a sort of Go^tterda^mmerung affair. Hammarskjold 
believes the U&N& is an organization that settles matters 
in a procedural way **h".   Peter Marshall reflected. If Hammarskjold 
had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner, and if 
Bang-Jensen had not wanted it- who had ordered it?   "Mr& 
Gross, concerning the formation of your Committee, there's the 
fact that you have been a legal adviser to the U&N& in the past; 
as I understand it, Mr& Hammarskjold wanted <outside> advice. 
Could you comment on that"?   "I've served as a counsel 
for the U&N& for some years, specializing particularly in real 
estate matters or other problems that the regular U&N& legal 
staff might not be equipped to handle. Mr& Stavropoulos is the U&N& 
legal chief and a very good man, but he is not fully versed on 
some technical points of American law".   "What did you think 
about Bang-Jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the 
Hungarian report"? Marshall asked.   "Those"! Gross 
answered. "Why, Mick Shann went over and over the report with Alsing 
Andersen, trying to check them out. Even after the incident between 
Bang-Jensen and Shann in the Delegates' Lounge **h and this 
was not the way the <Chicago Tribune> presented it".   Gross 
reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings. One 
was an article on the U&N& by Alice Widener from the <Cincinnati 
Enquirer>. The other was by Chesly Manley in the <Chicago 
Daily Tribune>.   Gross pointed to the Manley story. "I 
know Ches, he's a friend of mine. He probably didn't mean to write 
it this way, or maybe he did. There wasn't any 'violent argument' 
between Bang-Jensen and Shann, as the <Tribune> puts it. That 
implies that Shann was on the enemy side. You see what I mean? 
How it's phrased there- the word 'violent'.   "The 
case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further 
errors in the report. 'I've found errors and I want you to 
look them over'. So once again Shann had to argue with him about 
this. But it wasn't a violent discussion. And after all this, Shann 
went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up".   (Shann's 
own report, Peter Marshall reflected, describes the encounter as 
"immoderate". Bang-Jensen was in "hysterical condition".)

Gross stopped briefly, then went on. "Shann was responsible 
for the report. He has felt terrible about all this. It was a good 
report, he did all he could to make it a good report. When I speak 
of how Shann felt, I know well. Don't forget, I am an old member 
of the club, a former delegate. I think you are being unfair to take 
these things up now.   "You know, this hits in many areas. It 
appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian 
situation. Don't forget, the U&N& did no more than the United 
States did **h it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to 
get the impact of this fact". 

#CHAPTER 22#

FROM THE HOME 
of his friend, Henrik Kauffmann, in Washington, D&C&, Paul 
Bang-Jensen sent a telegram dated December 9, 1957, to Ernest Gross. 
It said in part:   "**h the matters to be considered are 
obviously of a grave character, and I therefore respectfully request 
that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that I might make 
adequate preparation".   Ernest Gross replied the next day, 
putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest. "This reveals some 
misunderstanding on your part. The group conducting the review is 
not holding formal hearings. It wished to pursue, in the course of this 
review, questions arising from the body of material already in its 
possession **h".   It sounded like a fair enough invitation, 
Peter Marshall reflected, and Bang-Jensen must have thought so too, 
because on the thirteenth, he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth 
floor of the U&N&. There, Ernest Gross further assured him:

"We were requested by the Secretary General, as I understand 
it, to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant, 
and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee 
in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat. 
<The only rules which I think we shall follow will be those 
of common sense, justice, and fairness">.   Peter Marshall 
noted that Bang-Jensen had later referred to his two interviews with 
the Gross group as "unfortunate experiences", and after his second 
meeting on the sixteenth the Dane refused to attend further hearings 
without legal counsel. Marshall pondered the reason for this, and 
pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group.

J& A& C& Robertson, after serving Gross one week, left 
for England. 
Fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged. Another week passed 
and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage. The sickness 
was gone and, after all, the two young couples were on their honeymoon.

The only lasting difficulty was the food. In spite of Pickering 
Dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals, the 
food did not seem the same as at home. "Everything tasted differently 
from what it does on land and those things I was most fond of at 
home, I loathed the most here", Ann noted. At last they concluded 
that the heavy, full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise. 
Walking was the remedy, they decided, but a deck full of chicken 
coops and pigpens was hardly suitable. Skipping was the alternative. 
A rope was found and, like children in school, the missionaries 
skipped for hours at a time. Finally, tiring of so monotonous a form 
of exercise, they decided to dance instead. It was much more fun, reminding 
the girls of their old carefree days in the Hasseltine frolics 
room at Bradford. The weather turned warmer and with it came better 
appetites, although Harriet was still a little off-color. She could 
not face coffee or tea without milk, and was always craving types of 
food that were not available aboard a sailing ship. By now she was sure 
she was going to have a baby, deciding it would be born in India 
or Burma that November. She was more excited than frightened at the 
prospect of having her first child in a foreign land.   The crew 
of the <Caravan> never failed to amaze Ann, who during her stay 
in Salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language. She 
wrote in her journal, "I have not heard the least profane language 
since I have been on board the vessel. This is very uncommon".

She was now enjoying the voyage very much. Even the first wave 
of homesickness had passed, although there were moments when Captain 
Heard pointed out on his compass the direction of Bradford that she 
felt a little twinge at her heart. As for Adoniram, she found him 
to be "the kindest" of husbands.   On Sundays, with the permission 
of Captain Heard, who usually attended with two of his officers, 
services were held in the double cabin. Sometimes a ship would be 
sighted and the <Caravan> pass so close that people could easily 
be seen on the distant deck. Captain Heard did not communicate with 
any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the United 
States and Britain. As warmer temperatures were encountered Ann 
and Harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt 
water.   When May came the <Caravan> had already crossed 
the Equator. They were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope; the 
weather had turned wet and cold. At this time Harriet wrote in a letter 
which after their finally landing in India was sent to her mother:

"I care not how soon we reach Calcutta, and are placed 
in a still room, with a bowl of milk and a loaf of Indian bread. I 
can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming, oh, what a luxury. 
I have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel, and 
the almost intolerable smell after the rain, that I have done little 
more than lounge on the bed for several days. But I have been blest 
with excellent spirits, and to-day have been running about the deck, 
and <dancing> in our room for <exercise>, as well as ever".

While studying at the seminary in Andover, Adoniram had been working 
on a New Testament translation from the original Greek. He 
had brought it along to continue during the voyage. There was one particular 
word that troubled his conscience. This was the Greek word most 
often translated as "baptism".   Born a Congregationalist, 
he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having 
a few drops of water sprinkled on his head, yet nowhere in the whole of 
the New Testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized 
by sprinkling. John the Baptist used total immersion in the River 
Jordan for believers; even Christ was baptized by this method. 
The more Adoniram 
looked at the Greek word for baptism, the more unhappy 
he became over its true meaning.   As was only natural he 
confided his searchings to Ann, conceding ruefully that it certainly 
looked as if their own 
Congregationalists were wrong and the Baptists right.

Ann was very troubled. By this time she had learned that 
it was futile to argue with her young husband, yet the uncomfortable 
fact remained: the American Congregationalists were sending them as 
missionaries to the Far East and paying their salaries. What would 
happen if Adoniram "changed horses in midstream"? Baptists and 
Congregationalists in New England were on friendly terms. How embarrassing 
it would be if the newly appointed Congregationalist missionaries 
should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace Baptist 
teachings!   "If you become a Baptist, I will not", 
Ann informed her husband, but sweeping her threat aside Adoniram 
continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he 
found himself.   By early June they were a hundred miles off the 
coast of Ceylon, by which time all four missionaries were hardened 
seafarers. Even Harriet could boldly write, "I know not how it is; 
but I hear the thunder roll; see the lightning flash; and the 
waves threatening to swallow up the vessel; and yet remain unmoved".

Ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two 
strange tropical birds. Land was near, and on June 12, one hundred 
and fourteen days after leaving America, they actually saw, twenty miles 
away, the coast of Orissa.   Captain Heard gave orders for 
the ship to be anchored in the Bay of Bengal until he could obtain 
the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters.

Sometimes ships waited for days for such a man, but Captain 
Heard was lucky. Next day a ship arrived with an English pilot, 
his leadsman, an English youth, and the first Hindu the Judsons and 
Newells had ever seen. A little man with a "a dark copper color" 
skin, he was wearing "calico trousers and a white cotton short gown". 
Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance. "He looks 
as feminine as you can imagine", she decided.   The pilot possessed 
excellent skill at his calling; all day long the <Caravan> 
slowly made her way through the difficult passages. Alas, to Ann's 
consternation, his language while thus employed left much to be desired. 
He swore so loudly at the top of his voice, that she didn't get 
any sleep all the next night.   Next morning the <Caravan> was 
out of the treacherous Bay. Relieved of the major part of his responsibility 
for the safety of the ship, the pilot's oaths became fewer. 
Slowly she moved up the Hooghli River, a mouth of the mighty Ganges, 
toward Calcutta.   Ann was entranced with the view, as 
were her husband and friends. Running across the deck, which was empty 
now that the livestock had been killed and eaten, they sniffed the spice-laden 
breezes that came from the shore, each pointing out new and 
exciting wonders to the other.   Out came the journal and in it 
went Ann's own description of the scene:   "On each side 
of the Hoogli, where we are now sailing, are the Hindoo cottages, as 
thick together as the houses in our seaports. They are very small, 
and in the form of haystacks, without either chimney or windows. They 
are situated in the midst of trees, which hang over them, and appear 
truly romantick. The grass and fields of rice are perfectly green, and 
herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river, and 
the natives are scattered about differently employed. Some are fishing, 
some driving the team, and many are sitting indolently on the banks 
of the river. The pagodas we have passed are much larger than the 
houses".   Harriet was just as delighted. Where were the hardships 
she had expected? She was certain now that it would be no harder 
to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home 
in the big white house in Haverhill. With childlike innocence she wrote 
of the Indians as "walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands, 
with the tawny children around them **h. This is the most delightful 
<trial> I have ever had", she decided.   The Indians 
who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly, 
even if she was suitably shocked, according to the customs of the society 
in which she had been reared, to find them "naked, except a piece 
of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle".   At last they 
saw Calcutta, largest city of Bengal and the <Caravan's> destination. 
Founded August 24, 1690 by Job Charnock of the East India 
Company, and commonly called "The City of Palaces", it seemed 
a vast and elegant place to Ann Hasseltine Judson. Solid brick 
buildings painted dazzling white, large domes and tall, picturesque palms 
stretched as far as the eye could see, while the wharves and harbor 
were filled with tall-masted sailing ships. The noise stunned her. 
Crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their 
strange-sounding Bengali tongue.   Harriet's mouth watered 
with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last 
to her much-craved milk and fresh bread. Ann, pleased to see her friend 
happy, was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of Captain Heard 
had sent on board for their enjoyment. Cautiously she sampled her first 
pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of "a 
rich pear". Though she did not then know its name, this strange new 
fruit was a banana. 

#SIX#

The first act of Adoniram and Samuel 
on reaching Calcutta was to report at the police station, a necessity 
when landing in East India Company territory. On the way they 
tried to discover all they could about Burma, and they were disturbed 
to find that Michael Symes's book had not presented an altogether 
true picture. He had failed to realize that the Burmese were not really 
treating him as the important visitor he considered himself. They 
were in fact quietly laughing at him, for their King wished to have 
nothing to do with the Western world. When Captain John Gibault 
of Salem had visited Burma in 1793 his ship, the <Astra>, had been 
promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the Irrawaddy River. 
Although after much trouble he did manage to get it back, he discovered 
there was no trade to be had. All Captain Gibault took back 
to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum. A 
year later another Salem ship returned from Burma with a cargo of gum 
lacquer which nobody wanted to buy. After that Salem ships decided 
to bypass unfriendly Burma.   The Burmese appeared to have little 
knowledge of British power or any idea of trade. They despised 
foreigners. Cruel Burmese governors could, on the slightest whim, take 
a man's life. As for missionaries, even if they succeeded in getting 
into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the 
Christian faith to the Burmans. Unspeakable tortures or even execution 
might well be their fate.   "Go back to America or any 
other place", well-meaning friends of Captain Heard advised them, 
"but put thoughts of going to Burma out of your heads".   Somewhat 
daunted, the two American missionaries reached the police station 
where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk. When he discovered 
they had received from the Company's Court of Directors 
no permission to live in India, coupled with the fact that they were 
Americans who had been sent to Asia to convert "the heathen", he 
became more belligerent than ever.   They explained that they 
desired only to stop in India until a ship traveling on to Burma could 
be found. 
She describes, first, the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by 
this "unseasonable exultation"; he is answered by a confused, 
honest Englishman. The reasons for the Whig joy on this occasion are 
found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government, 
their delight at the prospect of a new war, their hopes of having the 
Tories hanged, and so on. As for the author of the <Englishman,> 
Mrs& Manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the 
Protestant cause should be left to "<Ridpath, Dick Steele,> and 
their Associates, with the Apostles of <Young Man's> Coffee-House".

Another controversy typical of the war between the 
<Englishman> and the <Examiner> centered on Robert (later Viscount) 
Molesworth, a Whig leader in Ireland and a member of the Irish 
Privy Council. On December 21, the day that the Irish House 
of Commons petitioned for removal of Sir Constantine Phipps, their 
Tory Lord Chancellor, Molesworth reportedly made this remark on the 
defense of Phipps by Convocation: "They that have turned the 
world upside down, are come hither also". Upon complaints from the 
Lower House of Convocation to the House of Lords, he was removed 
from the Privy Council, his remark having been represented as a blasphemous 
affront to the clergy. Steele, who had earlier praised Molesworth 
in <Tatler> No& 189, now defended him in <Englishman> 
No& 46, depicting his removal as a setback to the Constitution. On 
the other hand, Molesworth was naturally assailed in the Tory press. 
Swift, in the Dublin edition of <A Preface to the Bishop of Sarum's 
Introduction,> indicated his feelings by including Molesworth, 
along with Toland, Tindal, and Collins, in the group of those 
who, like Burnet, are engaged in attacking all Convocations of the clergy. 
In the same way he coupled Molesworth and Wharton in a letter 
to Archbishop King, and he had earlier described him as "the worst 
of them" in some "Observations" on the Irish Privy Council 
submitted to Oxford. A month later, in <The Publick Spirit of 
the Whigs,> he used Steele's defense of Molesworth as evidence of 
his disrespect for the clergy, calling Steele's position an affront 
to the "whole Convocation of <Ireland>". On this issue, then, 
as on so many in these months, Steele and Swift took rigidly opposed 
points of view.   In the early months of 1714, the battle 
between Swift and Steele over the issue of the Succession entered its 
major phase. The preliminaries ended with the publication of Steele's 
<Crisis> on January 19, and from that point on the fight proceeded 
at a rapid pace. In answer to <The Crisis,> Swift produced 
<The Publick Spirit of the Whigs,> his most extensive and bitter 
attack on his old friend. By this time, as we shall see, the Tories 
were already planning to "punish" Steele for his political writing 
by expelling him from the House of Commons. Despite his defense 
of himself in the final paper of the <Englishman> and in his speech 
before the House, their efforts were successful. Steele lost his 
seat in Parliament, and his personal quarrel with Swift, by now a public 
issue, thus reached its climax.   Of all the Whig tracts 
written in support of the Succession, <The Crisis> is perhaps the 
most significant. Certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate. 
Hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation, said to have reached 
40,000, and if one may judge by the reaction of Swift and other 
government writers, the work must have had considerable impact. Steele's 
main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate 
danger of a Stuart Restoration. To this end, the first and longest 
section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the Revolution 
to defend England against the "Arbitrary Power of a Popish Prince". 
In his comment on these laws Steele sounds all the usual notes 
of current Whig propaganda, ranging from a criticism of the Tory 
peace to an attack on the dismissal of Marlborough; but his principal 
theme is that the intrigues of the Tories, "our Popish or Jacobite 
Party", pose an immediate threat to Church and State. Like 
Burnet, he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the 
crisis. Treasonable books striking at the Hanoverian Succession, 
he complains, are allowed to pass unnoticed. In this connection, Swift, 
too, is drawn in for attack: "The Author of the Conduct of 
the Allies has dared to drop Insinuations about altering the Succession". 
In his effort to stir the public from its lethargy, Steele 
goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected 
in the event of a Stuart Restoration, and, with rousing rhetoric, he 
asserts that the only preservation from these "Terrours" is to 
be 
found in the laws he has so tediously cited. "It is no time", he 
writes, "to talk with Hints and Innuendos, but openly and honestly 
to profess our Sentiments before our Enemies have compleated and put 
their Designs in Execution against us".   Steele apparently 
professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his 
own good, since the government was soon to use it as evidence against 
him in his trial before the House. In the final issues of the <Englishman,> 
which ended just as the new session of Parliament began, 
he provided his enemies with still more ammunition. For example, No& 
56 printed the patent giving the Electoral Prince the title of Duke 
of Cambridge. In a few months the Duke was to be the center of 
a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the Protestant 
Succession. At the order of the Dowager Electress, the Hanoverian 
agents, supported by the Whig leaders, demanded that a writ 
of summons be issued which would call the Duke to England to sit in 
Parliament, thus further insuring the Succession by establishing a Hanoverian 
Prince in England before the Queen's death. Anne was 
furious, and Bolingbroke advised that the request be refused. Oxford, 
realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ, took the opposite 
view, for which the Queen never forgave him. Accordingly the 
request was granted, but the Elector himself, who had not been consulted 
by his mother, rejected the proposal and recalled his agent Schu^tz, 
whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the Hanoverian 
interest to suffer and had made Oxford's dismissal more likely 
than ever. Steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a 
plan. A few days after this <Englishman> appeared, Defoe reported 
to Oxford that Steele was expected to move in Parliament that the 
Duke be called over; Defoe then commented, "If they Could Draw 
that young Gentleman into Their Measures They would show themselves 
quickly, for they are not asham'd to Say They want Onely a head 
to Make a beginning".   The final issue of the <Englishman,> 
No& 57 for February 15, ran to some length and was printed 
as a separate pamphlet, entitled <The Englishman: Being the Close 
of the Paper So-called>. Steele's purpose is to present a general 
defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which 
had occupied him in the <Englishman;> but there is much here also 
which bears directly on his personal quarrel with Swift. Thus he complains, 
with considerable justice, that the Tory writers have resorted 
to libel instead of answering his arguments. His birth, education, 
and fortune, he says, have all been ridiculed simply because he has 
spoken with the freedom of an Englishman, and he assures the reader that 
"whoever talks with me, is speaking to a Gentleman born". As 
notable examples of this abuse, he quotes passages from the <Examiner,> 
"that Destroyer of all things", and <The Character of Richard 
Steele,> which he here attributes to Swift. Though put in rather 
maudlin terms, Steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis. 
His point is simply that the Tories have showered him with personal 
satire, despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right 
to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of 
the Sovereign. He claims, too, that his political convictions are simply 
those which are called "Revolution Principles" and which are 
accepted by moderate men in both parties.   The final section 
of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of Steele's 
relations with Swift. It purports to be a letter from Steele to 
a friend at court, who, in Miss Blanchard's opinion, could only be 
meant as Swift. Steele first answers briefly the charges which his 
"dear old Friend" has made about his pamphlet on Dunkirk and 
his 
<Crisis>. Then he launches into an attack on the Tory ministers, 
whom he calls the "New Converts"; by this term he means to ridicule 
their professions of acting in the interest of the Church despite 
their own education and manner of life- a gibe, in other words, 
at the "Presbyterianism" in Harley's family and at Bolingbroke's 
reputed impiety. The Tory leaders, he insinuates, are cynically 
using the Church as a political "By-word" to increase party friction 
and keep themselves in power. This is the principal point made 
in this final section of <Englishman> No& 57, and it caps Steele's 
efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the 
notion of the Tories as a "Church Party" supported by the body 
of the clergy.   Next, Steele turns his attention to the "Courtier" 
he is addressing. He explains that there are sometimes honorable 
courtiers, but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not 
hesitate to sacrifice his Sovereign and nation to his own avarice 
and ambition. Such, he implies, is the case with his friend, who is not 
really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts. 
If "Jack the Courtier" is really to be taken as Swift, the following 
remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of 
parties and its effect on their friendship: "I assure you, dear 
<Jack,> when I first found out such an Allay in you, as makes you 
of so malleable a Constitution, that you may be worked into any Form 
an Artificer pleases, I foresaw I should not enjoy your Favour much 
longer". He closes his "letter" by demanding that Dunkirk 
be demolished, that the Pretender be forced to move farther away from 
the coast of England, and that the Queen and the House of Hanover 
come to a better understanding. The last point was soon to be included 
in the "seditious" remarks used against him in Parliament.

The <Examiner,> during Steele's trial a month later, printed 
an answer from the "courtier" addressed to "R& S&" at 
Button's coffee-house. He reviews Steele's entrance into politics 
and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing 
to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly 
should be credited to the indulgence of his friends. Once more, 
in other words, Steele is said to be indebted to Swift for his "wit"; 
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared 
in the Tory press, especially the <Examiner>. In <The Publick 
Spirit of the Whigs,> it may be noted, Swift himself contemptuously 
dismissed Steele's reference to his friend at court: "I 
suppose by the Style of <old Friend,> and the like, it must be some 
Body <there> of his own Level; among whom, his Party have indeed 
more <Friends> than I could wish".   On February 16, 
Steele took his seat in Parliament. By now he was undergoing a fresh 
torrent of abuse from Tory papers and pamphlets, and action was being 
taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from Parliament. On the 
very day that the parliamentary session began, another "Infamous 
Libel" appeared, entitled <A Letter from the Facetious Dr& 
Andrew Tripe, at Bath, to the Venerable Nestor Ironside>. It is 
filled with the usual personal abuse of Steele, especially of his physical 
appearance; in the opening paragraph, too, Steele is accused 
of extreme egotism, of giving "himself the preference to all the learned, 
his contemporaries, from Dr& Sw-ft himself, even down to 
Poet Cr-spe of the Customhouse". 
When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944, it 
was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer, begun some 
years before. The film they did after his return was an inconsequential 
bit of nothing titled <Out of This World,> a satire on the Sinatra 
bobby-soxer craze. The twist lay in using Bing Crosby's voice 
on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken mouthed the 
words. If nothing else, at least two good songs came out of the project, 
"Out of This World" and "June Comes Around Every Year".

Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting 
songs, Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on. 
Their first collaboration came close. Early in 1941 they were assigned 
to a script titled <Hot Nocturne>. It purported to be a reasonably 
serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians, their aims, their 
problems- the tug-of-war between the "pure" and the "commercial"- 
and seemed a promising vehicle, for the two men shared a 
common interest in jazz.   Johnny Mercer practically grew up with 
the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears. He was born in Savannah, 
Georgia, in 1909. His father, George A& Mercer, was descended 
from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back 
to one Hugh Mercer, who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747.

The lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into 
real estate. His second wife, Lillian, was the mother of John H& 
Mercer. By the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the 
call. One day he followed the Irish Jasper Greens, the town band, 
to a picnic and spent the entire day listening, while his family spent 
the day looking. The disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time 
maid to keeping an eye on the boy. But one afternoon Mrs& 
Mercer met her; both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home. 
The mother inquired, "Where's Johnny, and why did you leave him"? 
"There was nothing else I could do", the maid answered, 
satisfied with a rather vague explanation. But Mrs& Mercer demanded 
more. The maid then told her, "Because he fired me".   With 
her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little 
else but get him started on the study of music- though she waited 
until he was ten- beginning with the piano and following that with 
the trumpet. Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for 
both instruments. Still, he did like music making and even sang in 
the chapel choir of the Woodberry Forest School, near Orange, Virginia, 
where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well. 
When he was fifteen John H& Mercer turned out his first song, a 
jazzy little thing he called "Sister Susie, Strut Your 
Stuff". 
If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have 
been, Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with 
a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect. From his playmates in Savannah, 
Mercer had picked up, along with a soft Southern dialect, traces 
also of the Gullah dialects of Africa. Such speech differences 
made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language.

During the summers, while he was still in school, Mercer worked 
for his father's firm as a messenger boy. It generally took well 
into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help. "We'd 
give him things to deliver, letters, checks, deeds and things 
like that", remembers his half-brother Walter, still in the real estate 
business in Savannah, "and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly 
stuffed them into his pocket. There they stayed". 
This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed 
to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since. It 
is, however, a disarming disguise, or perhaps a shield, for not only has 
Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the 
years, but also one who can function remarkably under pressure. He 
has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer (his records have 
sold in the millions) and is a sharp businessman.   He has also 
an extraordinary conscience. In 1927 his father's business collapsed, 
and, rather than go bankrupt, Mercer senior turned his firm over 
to a bank for liquidation. He died before he could completely pay off 
his debts. Some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation 
received a check for $300,000, enough to clear up the debt. The check 
had been mailed from Chicago, the envelope bore no return address, 
and the check was not signed.   "That's Johnny", sighed 
the bank president, "the best-hearted boy in the world, but absent-minded". 
But Mercer's explanation was simple: "I made out 
the check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in case I lost 
it". When he remembered that he might have not signed the check, 
Mercer made out another for the same amount, instructing the bank to 
destroy the other- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly 
signed both of them.   When the family business failed, Mercer 
left school and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he 
would become an actor- he joined a local little theater group. When 
the troupe traveled to New York to participate in a one-act-play competition- 
and won- Mercer, instead of returning with the rest of 
the company in triumph, remained in New York. He had talked one other 
member of the group to stay with him, but that friend had tired of 
not eating regularly and returned to Savannah. But Mercer hung on, 
living, after a fashion, in a Greenwich Village fourth-flight walk-up. 
"The place had no sink or washbasin, only a bathtub", his mother 
discovered when she visited him. "Johnny insisted on cooking a 
chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good cook- and I'll 
never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub".   A story, 
no doubt apocryphal, for Mercer himself denies it, has him sporting 
a monacle in those Village days. Though merely clear glass, it 
was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint 
himself upon the memories of producers. One day in a bar, so the legend 
goes, someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle 
and broke it. The innocent malfeasant, filled with that supreme sense 
of honor found in bars, insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle- 
and did, over the protests of the former owner- with a square monacle. 
Mercer is supposed to have refused it with, "Anyone who wears 
a square monacle must be affected"!   Everett Miller, then 
assistant director for the <Garrick Gaieties>, a Theatre Guild 
production, needed a lyricist for a song he had written; he just 
happened not to need any actor at the moment, however. For him Mercer 
produced the lyric to "Out of Breath Scared to Death of You", 
introduced in that most successful of all the <Gaieties>, by Sterling 
Holloway. This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon Duke 
and Ira Gershwin, by E& Y& Harburg and Duke, and by Harry 
Myers. Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged 
the burgeoning song writer to take a wife, Elizabeth Meehan, a dancer 
in the <Gaieties>. The Mercers took up residence in Brooklyn, 
and Mercer found a regular job in Wall Street "misplacing stocks 
and bonds".   When he heard that Paul Whiteman was looking 
for singers to replace the Rhythm Boys, Mercer applied and got the 
job, "not for my voice, I'm sure, but because I could write songs 
and material generally". While with the Whiteman band Mercer met 
Jerry Arlen. He had yet to meet Harold Arlen, for although they 
had "collaborated" on "Satan's Li'l Lamb", Mercer and 
Harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them. 
The lyric, Mercer remembers, was tailored to fit the unusual melody.

Mercer's Whiteman association brought him into contact 
with 
Hoagy Carmichael, whose "Snowball" Mercer relyriced as "Lazybones", 
in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning 
of Mercer's song-writing career. After leaving Whiteman, Mercer 
joined the Benny Goodman band as a vocalist. With the help of Ziggy 
Elman, also in the band, he transformed a traditional Jewish melody 
into a popular song, "And the Angels Sing". The countrywide 
success of "Lazybones" and "And the Angels Sing" could only 
lead to Hollywood, where, besides Harold Arlen, Mercer collaborated 
with Harry Warren, Jimmy Van Heusen, Richard Whiting, Walter 
Donaldson, Jerome Kern, and Arthur Schwartz. Mercer has also 
written both music and lyrics for several songs. He may be the only 
song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U& S& 
Treasury; he collaborated on a song with William Hartman Woodin, 
who was Secretary of the Treasury, 1932-33.   When Johnny 
Mercer and Harold Arlen began their collaboration in 1940, Mercer, 
like Arlen, had several substantial film songs to his credit, among 
them "Hooray for Hollywood", "Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride", 
"Have You Got Any Castles, Baby?", and "Too Marvelous 
for Words" (all with Richard Whiting); with Harry Warren he 
did "The Girl Friend of the Whirling Dervish", "Jeepers Creepers", 
and "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby". Mercer's 
lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances, 
a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair. 
Though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with 
the best of them, Mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit.

His casual, dreamlike working methods, often as not <in absentia>, 
were an abrupt change from Harburg's, so that Arlen had 
to adjust again to another approach to collaboration. There were times 
that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously.   Speaking 
of his work with Johnny Mercer, Arlen says, "Our working habits 
were strange. After we got a script and the spots for the songs were 
blocked out, we'd get together for an hour or so every day. While Johnny 
made himself comfortable on the couch, I'd play the tunes for 
him. He has a wonderfully retentive memory. After I would finish 
playing the songs, he'd just go away without a comment. I wouldn't 
hear from him for a couple of weeks, then he'd come around with the 
completed lyric".   Arlen is one of the few (possibly the only) 
composer Mercer has been able to work with so closely, for they held 
their meetings in Arlen's study. "Some guys bothered me", 
Mercer has said. "I couldn't write with them in the same room with 
me, but I could with Harold. He is probably our most original composer; 
he often uses very odd rhythms, which makes it difficult, and 
challenging, for the lyric writer".   While Arlen and Mercer 
collaborated on <Hot Nocturne>, Mercer worked also with Arthur 
Schwartz on another film, <Navy Blues>. Arlen, too, worked on 
other projects at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler. Besides 
doing a single song, "When the Sun Comes Out", they worked on 
the ambitious <Americanegro Suite>, for voices and piano, as well 
as songs for films.   The <Americanegro Suite> is in a sense 
an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection 
of Negro songs, not for a night club, but for the concert stage. The 
work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which 
Koehler set the words "There'll be no more work/ There'll 
be no 
more worry", matching the spiritual feeling of the jot. This grew 
into the song "Big Time Comin'". By September 1940 the suite 
had developed into a collection of six songs, "four spirituals, a 
dream, and a lullaby".   The Negro composer Hall Johnson studied 
the <Americanegro Suite> and said of it, "Of all the many 
songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid 
idiom in both words and music, these six songs by Harold Arlen 
and Ted Koehler easily stand far out above the rest. Thoroughly 
modern in treatment, they are at the same time, full of simple sincerity 
which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by 
no means to be confused with the average 'Broadway Spirituals' 
which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'Amen 
Corner', 'judgement day', 'Gabriel's horn', and a 
frustrated devil- with a few random 'Hallelujahs' thrown in for 
good measure.

I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole. It had a single porcelain 
stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards. It was 
here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role 
during the children's party. A much larger room, adjacent to the 
lavatory, served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet. That 
unused room was large enough for- well, say an elephant could get 
into it **h and, as a matter of fact, an elephant <did> **h   Something 
occurred on the morning of the children's party which may 
illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused 
us. It so happened that sports writer Arthur Robinson got out of the 
hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he would be back 
in 
an hour or two to continue his convalescence. Arthur Robinson traveled 
with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the <American>. 
He was ghost writer for Babe Ruth, whose main talent for literary 
composition was the signing of his autograph. Robbie was a war veteran 
with battle-shattered knees.   He arrived on crutches at the 
Newspaper Club with one of his great pals, Oliver Herford, artist, 
author, and foe of stupidity. Mr& Herford's appearance was that 
of a frustrated gnome. He seemed timid (<at first>), wore nose glasses 
from which a black ribbon dangled, and was no bigger than a jockey. 
Robinson asked Herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before 
they sat down for a highball and a game of cards. In the jakes, 
after Robbie and his crutches were properly stowed, Mr& Herford 
went to the adjoining facility. He had barely assumed his stance there 
when a fat fellow charged through the doorway. Without any regard for 
rest-room protocol, the hulking stranger almost knocked Herford off 
his pins. The artist-author said nothing, but stood to one side. He 
waited a long time. Nothing was said, nothing accomplished. The unrelieved 
stranger eventually turned away from the place of his- shall 
we dare say his Waterloo?- to go to the door.   Mr& Herford 
touched the fat man's arm. "Pardon me, sir. May I say that 
you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb- the younger 
Pliny's, if memory serves me- which, translated freely from the 
archaic Latin, says, 'The more haste, the less peed'".

Governor Alfred E& Smith was the official host at the children's 
party. United States Senator Royal S& Copeland was wearing 
the robes of Santa Claus and a great white beard; the Honorable 
Robert Wagner, Sr&, at that time a justice of the New York Supreme 
Court, was on the reception committee. I was in charge of the 
arrangements- which were soon enough disarranged.   I had had 
difficulties from the very first day. When, in my enthusiasm, I proposed 
the party, my city editor (who disliked the club and many of its 
members) tried to block my participation in the gala event. Even earlier 
than that he had resented the fact that I had been chosen to edit 
the club's <Reporter>.   City editor Victor Watson of the 
New York <American> was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious 
shifts of mood. Mr& Hearst's telegraphic code word for Victor 
Watson was "fatboy". The staff saw in him the qualities of a 
Don Cossack, hence, as mentioned before, his nickname "the Hetman".

The Hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage 
rider of the steppes. Indeed, he looked more like a well-fleshed 
lay brother of the Hospice of St& Bernard. Nor were his manners 
barbaric. He had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features 
which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the 
bodies were buried. He was the son of a Scottish father and an American 
Jewish mother, long widowed, with whom he lived in a comfortable 
home in Flushing. He had worked in the newspaper business since he 
was nineteen years old, always for the Hearst service. From the very 
first he regarded himself as Mr& Hearst's disciple, defender, and 
afterward his prime minister, self-ordained.   It was said that 
the Hetman plotted to take over the entire Hearst newspaper empire 
one day by means of various coups: the destruction of editors who 
tried to halt his course, the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes 
of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to Mr& Hearst. Whatever 
the Hetman's ambitions, his colleagues were kept ill at ease. 
Among the outstanding members of the Hearst cabinet whom he successfully 
opposed for a time were the great Arthur Brisbane, Bradford 
Merrill, S&S& Carvalho, and Colonel Van Hamm. He also disliked 
Runyon, for no good reason other than the fact that the Demon's 
talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the Hetman's say-so 
or his supervision.   Runyon, for his part, had a contemptuous 
regard for Mr& Watson. "He's a wrong-o", said Runyon, 
"and I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw the Statue of 
Liberty".   Arthur "Bugs" Baer wrote to me just recently, 
"Vic wanted to die in harness, with his head towards the wagon. 
He supported his mother and his brother, who afterwards committed 
suicide. Watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother, 
blossoms bought with Vic's allowance to him. 'And would you 
believe it', Vic added, 'she likes him better than she does me. 
Why'"?   About the only time the Hetman seemed excited 
was 
when one of his own pet ideas was born. Then he would get to his feet, 
as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers, and say almost 
invariably, "Gentlemen, this is an amazing story! It's bigger 
than the Armistice".   Some of the Hetman's "ideas" 
were dream-ridden, vaguely imparted, and at times preposterous. One 
day he assigned me to lay bare a "plot" by the Duponts to supply 
munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur 
in Cuba. He said that his information was so secret that he would 
not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.   "I 
can tell you this much", he said. It's bigger than the Armistice".

I worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment 
and consulted several of my own well-informed sources. Then I spent 
the next two days at the baseball park and at Jack Doyle's pool 
parlors. When I returned to make my report, the Hetman did not remember 
having sent me on the secret mission. He was busy, he said, in 
having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation. And I was to go 
to work on that odd matter. I shall tell of it later on.   The 
Hetman had a strong liking for a story, any story which was to be had 
by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods. Most of my stories 
were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me 
the facts, and not as a rule by playing clever tricks.   One day 
I tired of following the Hetman's advice of "shadowing" and 
of the "ring-around-the-rosie" approach to a report that Enrico Caruso 
had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the Central Park monkey 
house. I explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and 
to "Bugs" Baer. Mr& Baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and 
spirit-gum from an actor at the Friars. We fashioned beards, put 
them on, and reported to the Hetman at the city desk.   Mr& 
Baer had an auburn beard, like Longfellow's. Mr& McCay had on 
a sort of Emperor Maximilian beard and mustache. As for myself, I 
had on an enormous black "muff". This, together with a derby hat 
and horn-rim eyeglasses, gave me the appearance of a Russian nihilist.

"We are ready for your next mysterious assignment", said 
Mr& Baer to the Hetman. "Where to, sir"?   Mr& Watson 
did not have much humor in his make-up, but he managed a mirthless 
smile. Just then a reporter telephoned in from the Bronx to give 
the rewrite desk an account of a murder. The Hetman told me to take 
the story over the phone and to write it. While I was sitting at one 
of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard, Arthur 
Brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand. He paused 
for a moment to look at me, then went on to the city desk to deliver 
his "Today" column.   I thought it expedient to take off my 
derby, my glasses, and the beard; and also to change telephones. I 
managed to do this by the time the great A&B& returned to the place 
where he last had seen the fierce nihilist. He stood there staring 
with disbelief at the vacant desk. Then he wrinkled his huge brow 
and went slowly out of the room. He had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression. 
He had been "seeing things".   The Hetman's 
"ideas" 
for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless 
or lacking in merit. He campaigned successfully for the riddance 
of "Death Avenue" and also brought about the ending of pollution 
of metropolitan beaches by sewage. He exposed the bucket-shop racket 
with the able assistance of two excellent reporters, Nat Ferber 
and Carl Helm. In the conduct of these and many other campaigns, the 
Hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed.

It seems to me now, in a long backward glance, that many of 
the Hetman's conceits and odd actions- together with his grim posture 
when brandishing the hatchet in the name of Mr& Hearst- were 
keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day. Alone, 
rejected on every hand, divorced, and in financial trouble, he leaped 
from an eleventh-floor window of the Abbey Hotel in 1937.   One 
finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited 
for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol, W&R& 
Hearst. That word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure 
of his despair. The unfinished note, written in pencil upon the back 
of a used envelope, and addressed to the coroner, makes one wonder 
about many things: "God forgive me for everything. <I cannot> 
**h"   Much to Damon Runyon's amazement, as well as my own, 
I got along splendidly with the Hetman; that is, until I became 
an editor, hence, in his eyes, a rival. Not long after Colonel Van 
Hamm had foisted me on the Watson staff I received a salary raise 
and a contract on the Hetman's recommendation. During the next years 
he gave me the second of the five contracts I would sign with the 
Hearst Service. It was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to 
have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists. 
I would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement. 
Somehow I think that Watson paid more attention to me than he 
otherwise might have because his foe, Colonel Van Hamm, wouldn't 
touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.   I remember one day when 
Mr& Hearst (and I never knew why <he> liked me, either) sent the 
Hetman a telegram: "Please find some more reporters like that 
young man from Denver". Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm. 
The colonel grunted, then made a remark which might be construed 
in either of two ways. "Don't bother to look any further. We already 
<have> the only one of its kind".   The Hetman did have 
friends, but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession. Sergeant 
Mike Donaldson, Congressional Medal of Honor soldier, was 
one of them. Dr& Menas S& Gregory was another. I used to go 
with Watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment, to sit 
among the doctor's excellent collection of statues, paintings, and 
books and drink Oriental coffee while Watson seemed to thaw out and 
become almost affable.   There was one time, however, when his 
face clouded and he suddenly blurted, "Why did my brother commit 
suicide"?   I cannot remember Dr& Gregory's reply, if, 
indeed, he made one. 
If she were not at home, Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose 
was there. Sometimes, Mrs& Coolidge would close herself in the 
Green Suite on the second floor, and play the piano she had brought 
to the White House. Mama knew she was playing her son's favorite 
pieces and feeling close to him, and did not disturb her.   All 
the rest of the days in the White House would be shadowed by the tragic 
loss, even though the President tried harder than ever to make his 
little dry jokes and to tease the people around him.   A little 
boy came to give the President his personal condolences, and the President 
gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be 
shown in. Backstairs, the maids cried a little over that, and the standing 
invitation was not mentioned to Mrs& Coolidge.   The 
President was even more generous with the First Lady than he had been 
before the tragedy. He would bring her boxes of candy and other presents 
to coax a smile to her lips.   He brought her shawls. Dresses 
were short in the days of Mrs& Coolidge, and Spanish shawls 
were thrown over them. He got her dozens of them. One shawl was so 
tremendous that she could not wear it, so she draped it over the banister 
on the second floor, and it hung over the stairway. The President 
used to look at it with a ghost of a smile.   Mrs& Coolidge 
spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection. She kept 
the dolls on the Lincoln bed. At night, when Mama would turn back the 
covers, she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place 
them elsewhere for the night. Mama always felt that the collection symbolized 
Mrs& Coolidge's wish for a little girl.   Among the 
dolls was one that meant very much to the First Lady, who would pick 
it up and look at it often. It had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist. 
An accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope 
was a name for Mrs& Coolidge's first granddaughter. Mama 
knew this doll was meant to help Mrs& Coolidge overcome her grief 
by turning her eyes to the future. The name inside the envelope was "Cynthia".

The Coolidges' life, after the death of their 
son, was quieter than ever. John was away at school most of the time. 
Mrs& Coolidge would knit, and the President would sit reading, 
or playing with the many pets around them.   Now and then, the 
President would call for "Little Jack, Master of the Hounds", 
which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the White House 
since Teddy Roosevelt's administration, and discuss the welfare 
of some one of the animals. It was part of Little Jack's work 
to look after the dogs.   One White House dog was immortalized 
in a painting. That was Rob Roy, who posed with Mrs& Coolidge 
for the portrait by Howard Chandler Christy. To get him to pose, 
Mrs& Coolidge would feed him candy, so he enjoyed the portrait sessions 
as well as she did.   I would like to straighten out a misconception 
about the dress Mrs& Coolidge is wearing in this painting. 
It is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the Smithsonian. 
People think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist 
much later on. This is not true. The dress in the painting is a 
bright red, with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side. There 
is a long train flowing from the shoulders.   Mrs& Coolidge 
gave Mama this dress for me, and I wore it many times. I still have 
the dress, and I hope to give it to the Smithsonian Institution 
as a memento, or, as I more fondly hope, to present it to a museum containing 
articles showing the daily lives of the Presidents- if I 
can get it organized.   But to get back to the Coolidge household, 
Mrs& Coolidge so obviously loved dogs, that the public sent her 
more dogs- Calamity Jane, Timmy, and Blackberry. The last two 
were a red and a black chow. Rob Roy remained boss of all the dogs. 
He showed them what to do, and taught them how to keep the maids around 
the White House in a state of terror.   The dogs would run 
through the halls after him like a burst of bullets, and all the maids 
would run for cover. Mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell 
on Rob Roy or not- since she had the ear of Mrs& Coolidge 
more than the other maids. But she was afraid the First Lady would 
not understand, because Rob Roy was a perfect angel with the First 
Family.   Every day, when the President took his nap, Rob Roy 
would stretch out on the window seat near him, like a perfect gentleman, 
and stare thoughtfully out the window, or he would take a little 
nap himself. He would not make a sound until the President had wakened 
and left for the office; then he would bark to let everyone know 
the coast was clear. His signal was for the other dogs to come running, 
but it was also the signal for Mama and the other maids to watch 
out.   Rob Roy was self-appointed to accompany the President to 
his office every morning. Rob Roy was well aware of the importance 
of this mission, and he would walk in front of the President, looking 
neither to the right nor to the left.   At dinner, lunch, or breakfast, 
the President would call out, "Supper"!- he called 
all meals supper- after the butler had announced the meal. All the 
dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the President and go to 
the dining room. They would all lie around on the rug during the meal, 
a very pretty sight as Rob Roy, Prudence, and Calamity Jane were 
all snow-white.   When Prudence and Blackberry were too young 
to be trusted in the dining room, they were tied to the radiator with 
their leashes, and they would cry. Mama tried to talk to them and keep 
them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the First 
Family returned.   Finally, Mama did mention to Mrs& Coolidge 
that she felt sorry for the little dogs, and then Mrs& Coolidge 
decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone, even though 
her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity.   Mama was 
now the first maid to Mrs& Coolidge, because Catherine, the previous 
first maid, had become ill and died. Mrs& Coolidge chose Mama 
in her place. It was a high mark for Mama.   Every First 
Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship. 
For the Coolidges, it was Mr& and Mrs& Frank W& Stearns 
of Boston, Massachusetts, owners of a large department store. They 
seemed to be at the White House half the time. The butlers were 
amused because when the Stearns were there, the President would say 
grace at breakfast. If the Stearns were not there, grace would be omitted.

Speaking of breakfast, the President inaugurated a new 
custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast table. The word 
was that this too was part of an economy move on his part. A new bill 
had been passed under Harding that designated the Government, rather 
than the President, as the tab-lifter for official meals. So the 
President would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting Government 
officials to attend.   He caused a lot of talk when he also 
chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair 
while he ate. Mama said that if Presidents were supposed to be colorful, 
Mr& Coolidge certainly made a good president. He knew exactly 
how to be colorful!   The favorite guest of the house, as 
far as the staff was concerned, was Mr& Wrigley, the chewing gum king. 
The White House had chewing gum until it could chew no more, and 
every Christmas, Mr& Wrigley sent the President a check for $100, 
to be divided among all the help. You can imagine that he got pretty 
good service.   Another good friend of the Coolidges' was 
George B& Harvey, who was the Ambassador to Great Britain from 
1921 to 1923. He had been a friend of the Hardings, and continued 
to be invited by the Coolidges.   The first royalty whom Mama 
ever waited on in the White House was Queen Marie of Rumania, 
who came to a State dinner given in her honor on October 21, 1926. 
She was not an overnight guest in the White House, but Mr& Ike 
Hoover, the chief usher, had Mama check her fur coat when she came 
in, and take care of her needs. Mama said she was one of the prettiest 
ladies she had ever seen.   Mama was very patriotic, and one of 
the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that 
flew above the White House. Actually, two flags were used at the 
mansion- a small one on rainy days, and a big one on bright days. 
The wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind, 
and Mama would mend it. She would often go up on the roof to see 
the attendant take down the flag in the evening. She used to tell me, 
"When I stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that 
way, I have the wonderful, safe feeling that Americans are protected 
no matter which way the wind blows".   Even when Mrs& 
Coolidge was in mourning for her son, she reached out to help other people 
in trouble. One person she helped was my brother. Mama had told 
her how Emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the 
war. He was in and out of Mount Alto Hospital for veterans any number 
of times.   Taking a personal interest, she had the doctor 
assigned to the White House, Dr& James Coupal, look Emmett over. 
As a result, he was sent to a hospital in Arizona until his health 
improved enough for him to come back to Washington to work in the 
Government service. But again, there was danger that his lungs would 
suffer in the muggy Washington weather, and he had to return to the 
dry climate of the West to live and work.   When Mrs& Coolidge 
was in mourning, she did not wear black. She wore grey every day, 
and white every evening. Mama knew that she was out of mourning when 
she finally wore bright colors. The President helped her a lot by selecting 
some lovely colored dresses to get her started. She opened the 
boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face.   On 
the social side, the chore Mama had at the formal receptions at the 
White House thrilled her the most. It was her job to stand at the 
foot of the stairs, and, just as the First Lady stepped off the last 
tread, Mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to 
the Blue Room to greet her guests with the President. Mama would 
enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone, and would note 
a gown here and there to tell me about that night.   One night, 
Mama came home practically in a state of shock. She had stood at the 
bottom of the stairs, as usual, when Mrs& Coolidge came down, in 
the same dress that is now in the Smithsonian, to greet her guests. 
Mama stooped down to fix the train, but there was no train there! She 
reached and reached around the dress, but there was nothing there. 
She looked up and saw that, without knowing it, Mrs& Coolidge was 
holding it aloft. Mrs& Coolidge looked down, saw Mama's horrified 
expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor. Mama 
swirled the train in place, and not a step was lost.   The Coolidges 
did not always live at the White House during the Presidency.

Impressive as this enumeration is, it barely hints at the diverse 
perceptions of Jews, collectively or individually, that have been 
attested by their Gentile environment. It is reasonable to affirm 
two propositions: <Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things 
to all men; some Jews have in fact been all things to all men>. 
In the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody's 
ally; they have observed correct neutrality; they have been 
someone's enemy. In the market place Jews have in fact under various 
circumstances been valued customers and suppliers, or clannish monopolists 
and cutthroat competitors. And so on through the roles referred 
to in the previous paragraph. Diversity of perception, yes; diversity 
of fact, yes.   But the two do not invariably or even 
typically coincide. The "conventional" image of a particular time 
and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as 
established over the years by scholarly and scientific research. Conventional 
images of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of 
a configuration in which one feature is held constant: images can be 
both true and false.   The genuinely interesting question, then, 
becomes: What factors determine the degree of realism or distortion 
in conventional images of Jews? The working test of "the facts" 
must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars 
and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation 
to relevant situations. Granted, such "functional" images are subject 
to human error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they 
are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against 
error.   In accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors 
can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence; predispositions 
regarding intelligence. General Grant may have been the victim 
of false information in the instance reported in this book; if so, 
he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed 
to bad information and dubious estimates of the future. But General 
Grant may have been self-victimized. He may have entered the situation 
with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the 
press of affairs.   Predispositions, in turn, fall conveniently 
into two categories for purposes of analysis. To some extent predispositions 
are shaped by exposure to group environments. In some measure 
they depend upon the structure of individual personality. The anti-Semitism 
of Hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of 
Lueger's politically successful Christian socialist movement in Vienna. 
But millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's propaganda 
and record. After allowing for group exposures, it is apparent 
that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism. 
These are personality factors; they include harmonies and conflicts 
within the whole man, and mechanisms whereby inner components are 
more or less smoothly met. Modern psychiatric knowledge provides us 
with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind.

The foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual 
images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or 
fall short of it. Undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of Gentile 
conceptions of the Jew unfolded in the present anthology is that 
it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination 
in terms of reality. Many selections are themselves convincing 
contributions to this appraisal.   Undoubtedly, however, the significance 
of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest. 
Speaking as a non-Jew I believe that its primary contribution is 
in the realm of future policy. Since we can neither undo nor redo the 
past, we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow. In this 
domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local, national, and 
world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having 
some effect, large or small, upon Gentile-Jewish relations. What 
shall these effects be?   I am deliberately raising the policy 
problems involved in Gentile-Jewish relations. Comprehensive examination 
of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual 
tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method. The tasks 
are briefly indicated by these questions: What are my goals in Gentile-Jewish 
relations? What are the historical trends in this country 
and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized? 
What factors condition the degree of realization at various 
times and places? What is the probable course of future developments? 
What policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will 
increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired 
events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values?

It is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions 
of such depth and range. The discussion is therefore limited to a 
suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance 
of this volume for future policy. As a groundwork for the proposal 
I give some attention to the first task enumerated above, the clarification 
of goal.   My reply is that I associate myself with 
all those who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute 
to the theory and practice of human dignity. The basic goal finds partial 
expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a statement 
initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many 
religious and philosophical traditions.   Within this frame of 
reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the 
Jews depend upon which Jewish identity is involved, as well as upon 
the nature of the claim, the characteristics of the claimant, the justifications 
proposed, and the predispositions of the community decision 
makers who are called upon to act. If Jews are identified as a religious 
body in a controversy that comes before a national or international 
tribunal, it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity 
to protect freedom of worship. When decision makers act within this 
frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion 
is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion. 
Since the recognition of Israel as a nation state, claims are made 
in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body 
politic. Community decision makers must make up their minds whether 
a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing 
expectations regarding members of nation states. In free countries 
many controversies involve self-styled Jews who use the symbol in asserting 
a vaguely "cultural" rather than religious or political identity. 
The decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must 
decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate 
to public policy regarding cultural groups.   We know that 
much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that 
cluster around the key symbol of the Jew. Many public and private controversies 
will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in 
the mind and usage of Gentile and Jew. However, in the context of legal 
and civic policy, these controversies are less than novel. They 
involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any 
number of non-Jewish groups. So far as the existing body of formal 
principle and procedure is concerned, categorical novelties are not 
to be anticipated in Jewish-Gentile relationships; claims are properly 
disposed of according to norms common to all parties.   It 
is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched 
within the public order of the world community or even of free 
commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving Jews 
and Gentiles during coming years. Social process is always anchored 
in past predisposition; but it is perennially restructured in situations 
where anchors are dragged or lost. In conformance with the 
maximization principle we affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations will 
be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the 
other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net 
advantage, taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration. 
It is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions 
will cumulate; for instance, imagine the situation if Israel 
ever joins an enemy coalition. The formal position of Americans who 
identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the 
Jewish symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal factors 
cannot be so easily assessed.   When we consider the disorganized 
state of the world community, and the legacy of predispositions adversely 
directed against all who are identified as Jews, it is obvious 
that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted 
with increasing vigor and skill. During moments of intense crisis 
the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming. But their 
freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which 
they and the people around them enter the crisis. At such critical 
moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously "pay 
off". By the same test predispositions destructive of human personality 
exercise their most sinister impact, with the result that men 
of good will are often trapped and nullified.   Among measures 
in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants 
of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of 
the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also 
able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near 
the limit of self-control. We are learning how to do these things 
in some of the vast organized structures of modern society; the process 
can be accelerated.   A truism is that the time to prepare 
for the worst is when times are best. During intercrisis periods the 
educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding 
the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human 
beings of every age and condition. As more men and women are made capable 
of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved 
that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength 
in future crises can be favorably affected.   Now an abiding 
difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach; 
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation 
of the goodness of the good. In any case I do not intend to 
let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the 
problem of implementing good intentions. I assume that the number of 
readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is 
small, and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which 
they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding 
of others. Properly used, the present book is an excellent instrument 
of enlightenment.   Let us not confuse the issue by labeling 
the objective or the method "psychoanalytic", for this is a well established 
term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated 
by Sigmund Freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered 
personalities. The traditional method proceeds by the technique 
of free association, punctuated by interpretations proposed by the 
psychoanalytic interviewer.   What we have in mind does have 
something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods 
by which they are sought. For what we propose, however, a psychoanalyst 
is not necessary, even though one aim is to enable the reader to 
get beneath his own defenses- his defenses of himself to himself. 
For this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is 
necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame 
of mind.   The relatively long and often colorful selections 
in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in 
what is said, whether he responds with anger or applause. But simple 
involvement is not enough; self-discovery calls for an open, permissive, 
inquiring posture of self-observation.   The symposium provides 
an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which 
were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were 
addressing definite audiences- and throughout several hundred pages 
everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification.

An advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important 
and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage 
of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances 
within himself, resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around 
the central figure of the Jew.

Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special 
significance for our time. One, a reservation on the point I have just 
made, is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking, pseudo-feeling, and pseudo-willing, 
which Fromm discussed in <The Escape from Freedom>. 
In essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the 
values and experience of others, rather than in one's own values 
and experience. There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how 
to be himself, 
reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody 
else. Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important. 
Moreover, if the critic instructs his audience in <what> to see in 
a work, he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs 
them in <how> to evaluate a work, he is helping them to achieve their 
own identity.   The second timely part of this sketch of literature 
and the search for identity has to do with the difference between 
good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products 
of today. In the range and variety of characters who, in their 
literary lives, get along all right with life styles one never imagined 
possible, there is an implicit lesson in differentiation. The reader, 
observing this process, might ask "why not be different"? and 
find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species. 
The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has 
only a permit to be, like the models he sees, even more like everybody 
else. And this, I think, holds for values as well as life styles. 
One would need to test this proposition carefully; after all, the large 
(and probably unreliable) <Reader's Digest> literature on the 
"most unforgettable character I ever met" deals with village grocers, 
country doctors, favorite if illiterate aunts, and so forth. Scientists 
often turn out to be idiosyncratic, too. But still, the proposition 
is worth examination.   It is possible that the study 
of literature affects the conscience, the morality, the sensitivity to 
some code of "right" and "wrong". I do not know that this is 
true; both Flu^gel and Ranyard West deal with the development 
and nature of conscience, as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber. 
It forms the core of many, perhaps most, problems of psychotherapy. 
I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the 
psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development 
of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate 
period of life, or, for the theologians of course, to the influence 
of religion.   Still, it would be surprising if what one reads did 
not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong; certainly the 
awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient 
literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence. 
Probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development 
of conscience, which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature, 
but the contents of conscience, the code which is imparted to the developed 
or immature conscience available. This is in large part a code 
of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and 
should do and how one should regard it. In a small way this is illustrated 
by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful 
influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated 
this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover, how to behave, how 
to think about this new experience, how to exercise restraint.

Literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose, dedication, 
mission, significance. This, no doubt, is part of what Gilbert Seldes 
implies when he says of the arts, "They give form and meaning 
to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense". Men 
seem almost universally to want a sense of function, that is, a feeling 
that their existence makes a difference to someone, living or unborn, 
close and immediate or generalized. Feeling useless seems generally 
to be an unpleasant sensation. A need so deeply planted, asking 
for direction, so to speak, is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples 
and heroic proportions of literature. The terms "renewal" 
and "refreshed", which often come up in aesthetic discussion, seem 
partly to derive their import from the "renewal" of purpose and 
a "refreshed" sense of significance a person may receive from poetry, 
drama, and fiction. The notion of "inspiration" is somehow cognate 
to this feeling. How literature does this, or for whom, is certainly 
not clear, but the content, form, and language of the "message", 
as well as the source, would all play differentiated parts in giving 
and molding a sense of purpose.   One of the most salient features 
of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and 
organization of emotion. Let us differentiate a few of these ideas. The 
Aristotelian notion of catharsis, the purging of emotion, is a persistent 
and viable one. The idea here is one of <discharge> but this 
must stand in opposition to a second view, Plato's notion of the 
<arousal> of emotion. A third idea is that artistic literature serves 
to <reduce emotional conflicts,> giving a sense of serenity and 
calm to individuals. This is given some expression in Beardsley's 
notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision. A fourth view is 
the transformation of emotion, as in Housman's fine phrase on the 
arts: they "transform and beautify our inner nature". It is possible 
that the idea of <enrichment> of emotion is a fifth idea. F&S&C& 
Northrop, in his discussion of the "Functions and Future 
of Poetry", suggests this: "One of the things which makes 
our lives drab and empty and which leaves us, at the end of the day, 
fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing, practical, 
utilitarian concern of common-sense objects. If art is to release 
us from these postulated things [things we must think symbolically 
about] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the 
aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy, it must sever its connection 
with these common sense entities". I take the central meaning 
here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without 
literature and a life enriched by it. Richards' view of the aesthetic 
experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him it constitutes, 
in part, the <organization of impulses>.   A sketch of 
the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account 
of all of these. But there is one in particular which, it seems 
to me, deserves special attention. In the wide range of experiences 
common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage, more 
troublesome, and more enduring in its effects than the control of love 
and hate. The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious 
way. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, it seems to me, have 
a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected: 
"For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love (and yet not 
aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem) 
and if it is to talk of anger and murder (and yet not aim at arousing 
anger and indignation)- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing 
with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification, compounding, 
or magnification, or any direct assault upon the affections 
at all. Something indirect, mixed, reconciling, tensional might well 
be the strategem, the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all 
kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like "expressions" 
of these emotions, without aiming at their incitement or 
even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement". 
The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions 
may be a most valuable human experience. Here I do not mean 
catharsis, the discharge of emotion. I mean something more like Freud's 
concept of the utility of "play" to a small child: he plays 
"house" or "doctor" or "fireman" as a way of mastering 
slightly frightening experiences, reliving them imaginatively until they 
are under control.   There is a second feature of the influences 
of literature, good literature, on emotional life which may have 
some special value for our time. In B& M& Spinley's portrayal 
of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London, a salient 
finding was the inability to postpone gratification, a need to satisfy 
impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring 
the experience. Perhaps it is only an analogy, but one of the most 
obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring 
quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation. 
Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature 
will understand what I mean. It is at least possible that the capacity 
to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in 
a continuous and guided exposure to great literature.   In any 
inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions, particularly 
with respect to the sense of harmony, or relief of tension, 
or sense of "a transformed inner nature" which may occur, a most 
careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which 
produces the effect would be required. In the calm which follows the 
reading of a poem, for example, is the effect produced by the enforced 
quiet, by the musical quality of words and rhythm, by the sentiments 
or sense of the poem, by the associations with earlier readings, if it 
is familiar, by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate, 
by 
the diversion of attention, by the sense of security in a legitimized 
withdrawal, by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded 
as forbidden, or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of 
words? These are, if the research is done with subtlety and skill, 
researchable topics, but the research is missing.   One of the 
most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility 
that it is thought to provide. Sensibility is a vague word, 
covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent, quality, 
or skill. Among other things it means perception, discrimination, sensitivity 
to subtle differences. Both the extent to which this is true 
and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged. 
Its truth is illustrated by the skill, sensitivity, and general 
expertise of the English professor with whom one attends the theatre. 
The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast 
the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues 
in discriminating among motor cars, political candidates, or female 
beauty. Along these lines, the particular point that sensitivity 
in literature leads to sensitivity in human relations would require more 
proof than I have seen. In a symposium and general exploration of 
the field of <Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior> the 
discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject, with one 
possible exception; Solomon Asch shows the transcultural stability 
of metaphors based on sensation (hot, sweet, bitter, etc&) dealing 
with personal qualities of human beings and events. But to go from here 
to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will 
also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential 
leap.   I would say, too, that the study of literature 
tends to give a person what I shall call <depth>. I use this term 
to mean three things: a search for the human significance of an event 
or state of affairs, a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts, 
and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling. It 
is the obverse of triviality, shallowness, emotional anaesthesia. I 
think these attributes cluster, but I have no evidence. In fact, I 
can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide, continuous, and 
properly guided exposure to literary art.

THE late R& G& Collingwood, a philosopher whose work 
has proved helpful to many students of literature, once wrote "We 
are all, though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it, in 
far closer sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace 
than with Chaucer and Cimabue, or even Shakespeare and Titian. By 
an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the 
art of a remote past or an alien present, and enjoy the carvings of 
cavemen and Japanese colour-prints; but the possibility of this 
effort 
is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the 
greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries, 
and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not 
taken place. The natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy 
contemporary art, to despise and dislike the art of the recent past, 
and wholly to ignore everything else".   One might argue that 
the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship is to correct this spontaneous 
provincialism that is likely to obscure the horizons of the general 
public, of the newspaper critic, and of the creative artist himself. 
There results a study of literature freed from the tyranny of the 
contemporary. Such study may take many forms. The study of ideas in 
literature is one of these. Of course, it goes without saying that no 
student of ideas can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene. He will 
frequently return to it. The continuities, contrasts, and similarities 
discernible when past and present are surveyed together are inexhaustible 
and the one is often understood through the other.   When 
we assert the value of such study, we find ourselves committed to 
an important assumption. Most students of literature, whether they call 
themselves scholars or critics, are ready to argue that it is possible 
to understand literary works as well as to enjoy them. Many will 
add that we may find our enjoyment heightened by our understanding. This 
understanding, of course, may in its turn take many forms and some 
of these- especially those most interesting to the student of comparative 
literature- are essentially historical. But the historian of 
literature need not confine his attention to biography or to stylistic 
questions of form, "texture", or technique. He may also consider 
ideas. It is true that this distinction between style and idea often 
approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and 
content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes 
appear as expressions of the same insight. But, in general, we 
may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of his attention 
toward one or the other.   At this point a working definition 
of <idea> is in order, although our first definition will have to 
be qualified somewhat as we proceed. The term <idea> refers to our 
more reflective or thoughtful consciousness as opposed to the immediacies 
of sensuous or emotional experience. It is through such reflection 
that literature approaches philosophy. An idea, let us say, may be 
roughtly defined as a theme or topic with which our reflection may 
be concerned. In this essay, we are, 
along with most historians, interested 
in the more general or more inclusive ideas, that are so to speak 
"writ large" in history of literature where they recur continually. 
Outstanding among these is the idea of human nature itself, including 
the many definitions that have been advanced over the centuries; 
also secondary notions such as the perfectibility of man, the depravity 
of man, and the dignity of man. One might, indeed, argue that the 
history of ideas, in so far as it includes the literatures, must center 
on characterizations of human nature and that the great periods of 
literary achievement may be distinguished from one another by reference 
to the images of human nature that they succeed in fashioning.

We need not, to be sure, expect to find such ideas in every piece of 
literature. An idea, of the sort that we have in mind, although of 
necessity readily available to imagination, is more general in connotation 
than most poetic or literary images, especially those appearing in 
lyric poems that seek to capture a moment of personal experience. Thus 
Burns's "<My love is like a red, red rose>" and Hopkins' 
"<The thunder-purple sea-beach, plumed purple of 
thunder>" although clearly intelligible in content, hardly present 
ideas of the sort with which we are here concerned. On the other hand, 
Arnold's "<The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea>", 
taken in its context, certainly does so.   Understanding a work 
of art involves recognition of the ideas that it reflects or embodies. 
Thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify 
a poem or an essay as being in idea or in ideal content or subject 
matter typical or atypical of its period. Again, he may discover embodied 
within its texture a theme or idea that has been presented elsewhere 
and at other times in various ways. Our understanding will very 
probably require both these commentaries. Very likely it will also include 
a recognition that the work we are reading reflects or "belongs 
to" some way of thought labelled as a "school" or an "-~ism", 
i&e& a complex or "syndrome" of ideas occurring together 
with sufficient prominence to warrant identification. Thus ideas like 
"grace", "salvation", and "providence" cluster together 
in traditional Christianity. Usually the work studied offers us a special 
or even an individualized rendering or treatment of the ideas in 
question, so that the student finds it necessary to distinguish carefully 
between the several expressions of an "-~ism" or mode of thought. 
Accordingly we may speak of the Platonism peculiar to Shelley's 
poems or the type of Stoicism present in Henley's "Invictus", 
and we may find that describing such Platonism or such Stoicism 
and contrasting each with other expressions of the same attitude or 
mode of thought is a difficult and challenging enterprise. After all, 
Shelley is no "orthodox" or Hellenic Platonist, and even his 
"romantic" Platonism can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries. 
Again, Henley's attitude of defiance which colors his ideal 
of self-mastery is far from characteristic of a Stoic thinker like 
Marcus Aurelius, whose gentle acquiescence is almost Christian, 
comparable to the patience expressed in Milton's sonnet on his own 
blindness.   In recent years, we have come increasingly to recognize 
that ideas have a history and that not the least important chapters 
of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects of literature 
and the arts, although these aspects should be studied in conjunction 
with the history of philosophy, of religion, and of the sciences. 
When these fields are surveyed together, important patterns of 
relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence, 
a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions, primarily 
literary, religious, and philosophical, but frequently including 
contact with the fine arts and even, to some extent, with science.

Here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history 
is built on the assumption that ideas are the primary objectives 
of the historian's research. Let us quote once more from R& G& 
Collingwood: "History is properly concerned with the actions 
of human beings **h Regarded from the outside, an action is an event 
or series of events occurring in the physical world; regarded from the 
inside, it is the carrying into action of a certain thought **h The 
historian's business is to penetrate to the inside of the actions 
with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts 
which constituted them. It is a characteristic of thoughts that **h 
in re-thinking them we come, <ipso facto>, to understand why they were 
thought". Such an understanding, although it must seek to be sympathetic, 
is not a matter of intuition. "History has this in common 
with every other science: that the historian is not allowed to claim 
any single piece of knowledge, except where he can justify his claim 
by exhibiting to himself in the first place, and secondly to any one 
else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration, the grounds 
upon which it is based. This is what was meant, above, by describing 
history as inferential. The knowledge in virtue of which a man 
is an historian is a knowledge of what the evidence at his disposal proves 
about certain events". It is obvious that the historian who seeks 
to recapture the ideas that have motivated human behavior throughout 
a given period will find the art and literature of that age one of 
his central and major concerns, by no means a mere supplement or adjunct 
of significant historical research.   The student of ideas and 
their place in history will always be concerned with the patterns of 
transition, which are at the same time patterns of transformation, whereby 
ideas pass from one area of activity to another. Let us survey 
for a moment the development of modern thought- turning our attention 
from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements 
that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades. We may thus 
trace the notion of individual autonomy from its manifestation in religious 
practice and theological reflection through practical politics 
and political theory into literature and the arts. Finally we may note 
that the idea appears in educational theory where its influence is 
at present widespread. No one will deny that such broad developments 
and transitions are of great intrinsic interest and the study of ideas 
in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference 
to them. Still, we must remember that we cannot construct and justify 
generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special 
instances of influence moving between such areas as theology, philosophy, 
political thought, and literature. The actual moments of contact 
are vitally important. These moments are historical events in the 
lives of individual authors with which the student of comparative literature 
must be frequently concerned.   Perhaps the most powerful 
and most frequently recurring literary influence on the Western world 
has been that of the Old and New Testament. Certainly one of 
the most important comments that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural 
life of any period of Western civilization during the past sixteen 
or seventeen centuries has to do with the way in which its leaders 
have read and interpreted the Bible. This reading and the comments 
that it evoked constitute the influence. A contrast of the scripture 
reading of, let us say, St& Augustine, John Bunyan, and Thomas 
Jefferson, all three of whom found in such study a real source of enlightenment, 
can tell us a great deal about these three men and the age 
that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression. In 
much the same way, we recognize the importance of Shakespeare's familarity 
with Plutarch and Montaigne, of Shelley's study of Plato's 
dialogues, and of Coleridge's enthusiastic plundering of the writings 
of many philosophers and theologians from Plato to Schelling 
and William Godwin, through which so many abstract ideas were brought 
to the attention of English men of letters.   We may also recognize 
cases in which the poets have influenced the philosophers and 
even indirectly the scientists. English philosopher Samuel Alexander's 
debt to Wordsworth and Meredith is a recent interesting example, 
as also A& N& Whitehead's understanding of the English romantics, 
chiefly Shelley and Wordsworth. Hegel's profound admiration 
for the insights of the Greek tragedians indicates a broad channel 
of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy. Again the 
student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinating, if to our minds 
grotesque, anticipation of the theory of chance variations and the 
natural elimination of the unfit in Lucretius, who in turn seems to 
have borrowed the concept from the philosopher Empedocles.   Here 
an important caveat is in order. We must avoid the notion, suggested 
to some people by examples such as those just mentioned, that ideas 
are "units" in some way comparable to coins or counters that can 
be passed intact from one group of people to another or even, for that 
matter, from one individual to another.

"Suppose you take Mr& Hearst's morning <American> at 
$10,000 a year", Brisbane proposed. "You could come down to the 
office once a day, look over a few exchanges, dictate an editorial, 
and then have the remainder of your time for your more serious literary 
labors. If within one year you can make a success out of the <American>, 
you can practically name your own salary thereafter. Of course, 
if you don't make the <American> a success, Hearst will have 
no further use for you".   The blue-eyed Watson decided that 
he would dislike living in New York, and the deal fell through. Hearst's 
luck was even poorer when he had a chat with Franklin K& 
Lane, a prominent California journalist and reform politician, whom 
he asked for his support. Lane was still burning because he had narrowly 
missed election as governor of California in 1902 and laid his defeat 
to the antagonism of Hearst's San Francisco <Examiner>. Hearst 
disclaimed blame for this, but the conversation, according to Lane, 
ended on a tart note.   "Mr& Lane", Hearst said, "if 
you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will have to do will 
be to send me a telegram asking, and it will be done".   "Mr& 
Hearst", Lane replied as he left, "if you ever get a telegram 
from me asking you to do anything, you can put the telegram down 
as a forgery".   Hearst took a brief respite to hurry home to 
New York to become a father. On April 10, 1904, his first child was 
born, a son named George after the late Senator. Hearst saw his wife 
and child, sent a joyful message to his mother in California, and 
soon returned to Washington, where on April 22, for the first time, 
he opened his mouth in Congress.   This was not before the House 
but before the Judiciary Committee, where he asked for action on 
one of his pet bills, that calling for an investigation of the coal-railroad 
monopoly. Attorney Shearn had worked on this for two years and 
had succeeded in getting a report supporting his stand from the United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Hearst 
had spent more than $60,000 of his own money in the probe, but still 
Attorney General Knox was quiescent.   Six of the railroads 
carrying coal to tidewater from the Pennsylvania fields, Hearst said, 
not only had illegal agreements with coal operators but owned outright 
at least eleven mines. They had watered their stock at immense 
profit, then had raised the price of coal fifty cents a ton, netting themselves 
another $20,000,000 in annual profit.   "The Attorney 
General has been brooding over that evidence like an old hen on a 
doorknob for eighteen months", Hearst said. "He has not acted in 
any way, and won't let anyone take it away from him **h What I want 
is to have this evidence come before Congress and if the Attorney 
General does not report it, as I am very sure he won't, as he has 
refused to do anything of the kind, I then wish that a committee of 
seven Representatives be appointed with power to take the evidence 
**h".

The Congressman tried hard, but failed. This was the very 
sort of legislation that Roosevelt himself had in mind. There can 
be little doubt that there was a conspiracy in Washington, overt or 
implied, to block anything Hearst wanted, even if it was something good. 
Hatred tied his hands in Congress. Roosevelt and others considered 
him partly responsible for the murder of McKinley. They were repelled 
by his noisy newspapers, his personal publicity, his presumptuous 
campaign for the Presidential nomination, and by the swelling cloud 
of rumor about his moral lapses. He might get votes from his constituents, 
but he would never get a helping hand in Congress. He was the 
House pariah. Even the regular Democrats disowned him. Inherently 
incapable of cooperating with others, he ran his own show regardless 
of how many party-line Democratic toes he stepped on. He was a political 
maverick, a reformer with his own program, determined to bulldoze 
it through or to blazon the infamy of those who balked him. He showed 
little interest in measures put forward by the regular Democrats. 
He sought to run Congress as he ran his New York <American> or 
<Journal>, a scheme veteran legislators resisted. For a freshman Congressman 
to read political lessons to graybeard Democrats was poor 
policy for one who needed to make friends. He soon quarreled with all 
the party leaders in the House, and came to be regarded with detestation 
by regular Democrats as a professional radical leading a small 
pack of obedient terriers whose constant snapping was demoralizing to 
party discipline.   To old-line Democrats, the Hearst Presidential 
boom, now in full cry, was the joke of the new century. Yet no 
leader had come to the fore who seemed likely to give the puissant T& 
R& a semblance of a race. There was talk of dragging old ex-President 
Cleveland out of retirement for another try. Some preferred 
Judge Alton B& Parker of New York. There was a host of dark 
horses. The sneers at Hearst changed to concern when it was seen that 
he had strong support in many parts of the country. Platoons of Hearst 
agents were traveling from state to state in a surprisingly successful 
search for delegates at the coming convention, and there were charges 
that money was doing a large part of the persuading. Just when 
it was needed for the campaign, Hearst Paper No& 8, the Boston <American>, 
began publication. A Bay State supporter said, "Mr& 
Hearst's fight has been helped along greatly by the starting of 
his paper in Boston". His candidacy affected his journalism somewhat. 
He ordered his editors to tone down on sensationalism and to refrain 
from using such words as "seduction", "rape", "abortion", 
"criminal assault" and "born out of wedlock".   In 
a story headed, "HEARST OFFERS CASH", the Republican New York 
<Tribune> spread the money rumor, quoting an unnamed "Hearst 
supporter" as saying:   "The argument that is cutting most 
ice is that Hearst is the only candidate who is fighting the trusts 
fearlessly and who would use all the powers of government to disrupt 
them if he were elected. The Hearst men say that if Hearst is nominated, 
he and his immediate friends will contribute to the Democratic 
National Committee the sum of $1,500,000. This, it is urged, would 
relieve the national committee from the necessity of appealing to the 
trust magnates. The alternative to this is that if a conservative candidate 
is nominated the national committee will have to appeal to the 
trusts for their campaign funds, and in doing this will incur obligations 
which would make a Democratic victory absolutely fruitless **h. 
the average Democratic politician, especially in the country districts, 
is hungry for the spoils of office. It has been a long time since 
he has seen any campaign money, and when the proposition is laid down 
to him as the friends of Mr& Hearst are laying it down these days 
he is quite likely to get aboard the Hearst bandwagon".   If 
anything, the conservative Democrats were more opposed to Hearst than 
the Republicans. In his own state of New York, the two Democratic 
bellwethers, State Leader Hill and Tammany Boss Murphy, were 
saying nothing openly against Hearst but industriously boosting their 
own favorites, Murphy being for Cleveland and Hill for Parker. They 
had lost twice with the radical Bryan, and were having no part of 
Hearst, whom they considered more radical than Bryan. But his increasing 
strength in the West looked menacing. It caused Henry Watterson 
to sound a blast in his Louisville <Courier-Journal:>

"**h Does any sane Democrat believe that Mr& Hearst, a person 
unknown even to his constituency and his colleagues, without a word 
or 
act in the public life of his country, past or present, that can be 
shown to be his to commend him, could by any possibility be elected President 
of the United States? But there is a Hearst 
barrel **h"

More splenetic was Senator Edward Carmack of Tennessee, 
a Parker man. "**h the nomination of Hearst would compass the ruin 
of the party", Carmack said. "It would be a disgrace, and, as I 
have already said to the people of Tennessee, if Hearst is nominated, 
we may as well pen a dispatch, and send it back from the field of 
battle: 'All is lost, including our honor'".   A lone 
pro-Hearst voice from New York City was that of William Devery, 
who had been expelled as a Tammany leader but still claimed strong influence 
in his own district. "I understand [Hearst] is a candidate 
for Presidential honors", Devery said without cracking a smile. 
"There's nothing like buildin' from the bottom up. If he's 
going to the St& Louis convention as a delegate we ought to know it. 
He's got a lot of friends, and he ought to come along and let us 
know if he wants our help".   Hearst won the Iowa state convention, 
but ran into a bitter battle in Indiana before losing to Parker, 
drawing an angry statement from Indiana's John W& Kern:

"We are menaced for the first time in the history of the Republic 
by the open and unblushing effort of a multi-millionaire to purchase 
the Presidential nomination. Our state has been overrun with a 
gang of paid agents and retainers **h As for the paid Hessians from 
other states, we are here to instruct the Indiana Democracy in their 
duty, I have nothing but contempt **h The Hearst dollar mark is all 
over them **h"

The talk of a Hearst "barrel" was increasing. 
Another Indiana observer later commented, "Perhaps we shall 
never know how much was spent [by Hearst], but if as much money 
was expended elsewhere as in Indiana a liberal fortune was squandered".

In his fight for the Illinois and Indiana delegations, 
Hearst made several trips to Chicago to confer with Andrew Lawrence, 
the former San Francisco <Examiner> man who was now his Chicago 
kingpin, and once to meet with Bryan. On one visit he stopped at 
the office of the <American>, where he was known surreptitiously as 
"the Great White Chief", and for the first time met his managing 
editor, fat Moses Koenigsberg. Koenigsberg never did learn what 
Hearst wanted, for the latter shook hands and moved toward the door.

"Never mind, thank you", he said. "I must hurry to catch 
my train".   Another editor pointed despairingly at a bundle 
of letters that had accumulated for him, saying, "But Mr& Hearst, 
what shall I do with this correspondence"?   "I'll 
show you", Hearst replied, grinning. He took the stack of mail and 
tossed it into the waste basket. "Don't bother. Every letter answers 
itself in a couple of weeks". #/2,. THE HEARST "BARREL"# 

HEARST hopped into a private railroad car with Max Ihmsen 
and made an arduous personal canvass for delegates in the western and 
southern states, always wearing a frock coat, listening intently to local 
politicians, and generally making a good impression. He laughed 
at a story that he planned to bolt the party if he was not nominated.

"I should, of course", he said, "like any other man, be 
honored and gratified should the Democrats see fit to nominate me. But 
I do not have to be bribed by office to be a Democrat. I have supported 
the Democratic party in the last five campaigns. I supported 
Cleveland three times and Bryan twice. I intend to support the nominee 
of the party at St& Louis, whoever he may be".   The 
Hearst press followed the Chief's progress at the various state conventions 
with its usual admiring attention, stressing the "enthusiasm" 
and "loyalty" he inspired. This was historic in its way, for 
it marked the first time an American Presidential aspirant had advertised 
his own virtues in his own string of newspapers spanning the land.

Yet his editors did not abandon their sense of story value. 
When Nan Patterson, a stunning and money-minded chorus girl who 
had appeared in a <Florodora> road show, rode down Broadway in a hansom 
cab with her married lover, Frank Young, she stopped the cab to 
disclose that Young had been shot dead, tearfully insisting that he 
had shot himself although experts said he could not have done so. 
Trevelyan's Liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit, a 
deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty. 
His passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure 
of Garibaldi's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation 
in the events described.   The three volumes brought to 
the fore a characteristic of Trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous 
through his later works- a genius for describing military action 
with clarity and with authority. The confused rambling of guerrilla 
warfare, such as most of Garibaldi's campaigns were, was brought 
to life by Trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books. 
His personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed 
much to the final result, but familiarity alone would not have 
been enough without other qualities. Military knowledge, love of 
detail, and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added 
ingredients.   But the Garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic 
story. Trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues 
connected with his subject. The outstanding example was in <Garibaldi 
and the Thousand>, where he made use of unpublished papers of 
Lord John Russell and English consular materials to reveal the motives 
which led the British government to permit Garibaldi to cross 
the Straits of Messina.   In looking back over the volumes, it 
is possible to find errors of interpretation, some of which were not 
so evident at the time of writing. Thus Trevelyan repeats the story 
which pictured Victor Emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous <Statuto> 
at the insistence of General Radetzky. Later research has 
shown this part of the legend of the <Re Galantuomo> to be false. 
Trevelyan accepts Italian nationalism with little analysis, he is 
unduly critical of papal and French policy, and he is more than generous 
in assessing British policy. But fifty years later the trilogy still 
maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification 
of Italy, a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at 
the time of publication.   Trevelyan's <Manin and the Venetian 
revolution of 1848>, his last major volume on an Italian theme, 
was written in a minor key. Published in 1923, it did not gain the popular 
acclaim of the Garibaldi volumes, probably because Trevelyan 
felt less at home with Manin, the bourgeois lawyer, than with Garibaldi, 
the filibuster. The complexities of Venetian politics eluded him, 
but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures, 
with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of 
the part played by its leading figure. If it is not one of his best 
books, it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his 
own <Garibaldi>.   Already Trevelyan had begun to parallel 
his nineteenth-century Italian studies with several works on English 
figures of the same period. First <The life of John Bright> appeared 
and seven years later <Lord Grey of the Reform Bill>. Of 
the two, the life of Bright is incomparably the better biography. Trevelyan 
centers too exclusively on Bright, is insufficiently appreciative 
of the views of Bright's opponents and critics, and makes light 
of the genuine difficulties faced by Peel. Yet he is right when he 
claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man, 
his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength. In 
the story of Bright and the Corn Law agitation, the Crimean War, 
the American Civil War, and the franchise struggle Trevelyan reflects 
something of the moral power which enabled this independent man 
to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so 
long. Because Bright's speeches were so much a part of him, there 
are long and numerous quotations, which, far from making the biography 
diffuse, help to give us the feel of the man. Associated in a sense 
with the Manchester School through his mother's family, Trevelyan 
conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive. 
Nineteenth-century virtues, however, seem somehow to have gone out 
of fashion and the Bright book has never been particularly popular.

The biography of Lord Grey is strictly speaking not a biography 
at all. It is a Whig history of the "Tory reaction" which preceded 
the Reform Bill of 1832, and it uses the figure of Grey to 
give some unity to the narrative. The volume is a piece of passionate 
special pleading, written with the heat- and often with the wisdom, 
it must be said- of a Liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians 
from 1782 to 1832. Characteristically, Trevelyan enjoyed writing 
the work. The theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter 
of discontent and repression was, he has told us, congenial to his artistic 
sense. And Grey's Northumberland background was close to 
Trevelyan's own. But his concentration on personalities and his categorical 
assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities 
of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted 
with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social 
transformation. Some historians have found his point of view not 
to their taste, others have complained that he makes the Tory tradition 
appear "contemptible rather than intelligible", while a sympathetic 
critic has remarked that the "intricate interplay of social dynamics 
and political activity of which, at times, politicians are the 
ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents". 
The Liberal-Radical heritage which informs all of Trevelyan's 
interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues 
and oversimplified the period. For once his touch deserted him.

Research in the period of Grey and Bright led naturally to 
a more ambitious work. <Britain in the nineteenth century> is a textbook 
designed "to give the sense of continuous growth, to show how 
economic led to social, and social to political change, how the political 
events reacted on the economic and social, and how new thoughts and 
new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process". 
The plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832. More temperately 
than in the study of Grey and despite his Liberal bias, Trevelyan 
vividly sketches the England of pre-French Revolution days, 
portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich 
colors, and brings developments leading to the Reform Bill into sharp 
and clear focus. His technique is genuinely masterful. By what one 
reader called a "series of dissolving views", he merges one period 
into another and gives a sense of continuous growth.   But after 
1832, the narrative tends to lose its balanced, many-sided quality 
and to become a medley of topics, often unconnected by any single thread. 
Economic analysis was never Trevelyan's strong point and the 
England of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis. 
Yet after 1832, the interrelations of economic and social and political 
affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional 
political account. Finally, the period after 1870 receives 
little attention and that quite superficial. Yet <Britain in the nineteenth 
century> became the <vade mecum> of beginning students of 
history, went through edition after edition, and continues to be reprinted 
up to the very present. Its success is a tribute, above all, to 
Trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist.   In 1924 Trevelyan 
traveled to the United States, where he delivered the Lowell 
lectures at Harvard University. These lectures formed the nucleus of 
a general survey of English development which took form afterward as 
a <History of England>. In short order, the general history became 
his most popular work and has remained, aside from his later <Social 
history>, the work most widely favored by the public.   The 
<History of England> has often been compared with Green's <Short 
history>. Like Green, Trevelyan aimed to write a history not 
of "English kings or English conquests", but of the English people. 
The result was fortunate. The <History> takes too much for 
granted to serve as a text for other than English schoolboys, and like 
<Britain in the nineteenth century> it deteriorates badly as it goes 
beyond 1870. Trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were 
rarely happy ones. But as a stimulating, provocative interpretation 
of the broad sweep of English development it is incomparable. Living 
pictures of the early boroughs, country life in Tudor and Stuart 
times, the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive 
surveys of language and literature, the common law, parliamentary development. 
The strength of the <History> is also its weakness. Trevelyan 
is militantly sure of the superiority of English institutions and 
character over those of other peoples. His 
nationalism was not a new characteristic, but its self-consciousness, 
even its self-satisfaction, is more obvious in a book that stretches 
over the long reach of English history. And yet the elements which 
capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the 
English story worth telling and worth remembering. Tolerance and 
compromise, social justice and civil liberty, are today too often in short 
supply for one to be overly critical of Trevelyan's emphasis on 
their central place in the English tradition. Like most major works 
of synthesis, the <History of England> is informed by the positive 
views of a first-class mind, and this is surely a major work.

Four years after the publication of the <History of England>, the 
first volume of Trevelyan's Queen Anne trilogy appeared. By now 
he had become Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge 
and had been honored by the award of the Order of Merit. His academic 
duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen. <Blenheim> 
was followed in rapid succession by <Ramillies and the union with 
Scotland> and by <The peace and the Protestant succession>, the 
three forming together a detailed picture of <England under Queen Anne>. 
Like his volume on Wycliffe, the work was accompanied by the 
publication of a selected group of documents, in this case illustrative 
of the history of Queen Anne's reign down to 1707.   Trevelyan 
was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious 
desire to take up the story where Macaulay's <History of England> 
had broken off. In addition, he believed in the "dramatic 
unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14, lying between the Stuart 
and Hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own". He saw 
the age as one in which Britain "settled her free constitution" 
and attained her modern place in the world. To most observers, there 
is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon 
the years of Anne's reign which in reality existed only in the 
pages 
of his history.   Of the three volumes, <Blenheim> is easily 
the best. In four opening chapters reminiscent of Macaulay's famous 
third chapter, Trevelyan surveys the state of England at the opening 
of the eighteenth century. His delightful picture of society and 
institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly 
to life. He tends to underestimate- or perhaps to view charitably- 
the brutality and the violence of the age, so that there is an idyllic 
quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality. 
Yet as an evocation of time past, there are few such successful 
portraits 
in English historical literature. Once the scene is set, Trevelyan 
skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax 
in the dramatic victory of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy at Blenheim. 
The account of the battle is, next to his descriptions of Garibaldi's 
campaigns, Trevelyan's outstanding military narrative. The 
scene is etched in sharp detail, the military problems brilliantly 
explained, and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident. 
If only for this modest masterpiece of military history, <Blenheim> 
is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations 
have perhaps altered our picture of the Marlborough wars.   <Ramillies 
and the union with Scotland> has fewer high spots than <Blenheim> 
and much less of its dramatic unity. Yet in several chapters 
on Scotland in the eighteenth century, Trevelyan copes persuasively 
with the tangled confusion of Scottish politics against a vivid background 
of Scottish religion, customs, and traditions.

I stood on a table, surrounded by hundreds of expectant young 
faces. Questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship 
activities. After making a short statement about human rights, and the 
freedom to travel, I told them I would be going to the Kehl bridge 
the next morning in order to cross the Rhine into Germany. 
"May we come with you"? called out a dozen young voices.

"Well, I might not get that far", I told them, "as actually 
I have no papers to enter Germany and, as a matter of fact, no permit 
to return to France once I leave".   That was all they needed. 
They would champion me. We would all meet at ten o'clock at 
the Kehl bridge, five miles from Strasbourg, and march triumphantly 
across into Germany.   There was only one hitch: the small town 
of Kehl, on the other side of the Rhine, was still under French 
jurisdiction. The real Franco-German frontier was beyond the town's 
limits. In fact, all persons were permitted to cross the Rhine into 
Kehl, there being no sentry posted on the west side of the river.

That evening, as I learned later, the students, enjoying that 
spontaneous immodesty in action known only to university students, surged 
out onto the streets of Strasbourg, overturning empty streetcars, 
marking up store fronts, and shouting imprudently, "Garry Davis 
to power"!   As I got off the trolley at Kehl bridge the 
next morning, I was met by what looked like 5,000 students, some of whom 
were carrying sticks apparently for the coming "battle" with the 
police. Alarmed by this display of weapons, I looked toward the bridge 
and there saw, stretched across the near side, a cordon of policemen, 
their bicycles forming a roadblock before which stood several French 
officers in uniform and a small waspish man in a brown derby.

"Listen please", I called to the students in French. "I 
thank you most heartily for being here. This is full evidence of your 
support for my principles. These principles, however, will not be served 
by violence in any form. If they are right, they will prevail of 
and by themselves. I ask you all to support me in this. If one finger 
is raised against the authorities, all our moral power will vanish. 
Your self-control in this respect will be the only witness to your 
understanding of what I am saying. I have full confidence in you. Now, 
let's go".   I marched up to the waiting officials, the students 
massed behind me. As usual, the press photographers were on hand. 
The waspish man stopped me three paces from the bicycle barricade, 
and asked me in French if I had papers to leave France. I replied 
in the affirmative, taking out my recently acquired <titre d'identite 
et de voyage>, on which was stamped a permission to leave Fran 
e. He examined it carefully, handed it back and said, "<Eh bien>, 
you may leave France".   I took one step **h eastward.

One of the uniformed officers stepped in my way, demanding to know 
whether I had permission to enter Germany.   "No, I have 
no permission to enter Germany", I told him.   "<Alors>, 
you may go no farther", he said imperiously.   "Is this then 
the frontier"? I asked him.   "Yes".   At this, 
the students let out a yell, knowing full well the actual frontier was 
beyond the town of Kehl.   "But I have no permission to re-enter 
France, and I have just left", I told him. "I must then 
be standing on the line between France and Germany".   The 
waspish man stepped forward. "Line? Line? But there is no line 
between France and Germany, that is, no actual <line> **h I mean 
**h"   "No line"? I asked. "But if there is no line, 
how can there be two countries? You have just given me permission 
to leave France, which I did. I have witnesses. And as you know, 
I have no permission to re-enter France once out. Now I learn I 
cannot 
enter Germany. Obviously I'm stuck on the line between the two 
countries".   The students were laughing uproariously at this 
piece of logic, and even the policemen were trying hard not to smile.

"<Mais non>", the Interior Ministry man coaxed, "you 
may come back to Strasbourg, now, if you wish".   "Oh? Then 
will you give me a visa to re-enter France"?   "Visa? 
But there is no question of a visa. You are still in France".

"Ah, then please tell me where the frontier is because this 
gentleman here"- I indicated the French occupation officer- "informs 
me that Germany is just on the other side of him". 
The Interior man looked uneasily at his French compatriot. From the 
crowd were coming cries of "He's right"! "There must be 
a line"! and "Bravo, Garry, continue"!   Seeing their 
hesitation, I said, "Well, until I have permission to enter Germany, 
or a visa to re-enter France, I shall be obliged to remain here 
**h on the line between two countries", whereupon I moved to the 
side of the road, parked my backpack against the small guardhouse on 
the sidewalk, sat down, took out my typewriter, and began typing the 
above conversation.   The reporters were questioning the Interior 
man and the French officer, both of whom remained noncommittal as 
to what action, if any, would be taken in my regard. Finally they 
went 
off to file their stories, after the photographers had taken pictures 
of my latest vigil. The students crowded around asking questions, slapping 
me on the back, and generally being friendly.   "But what 
will you do this evening, Mr& Davis"? asked a young mustached 
Frenchman. "It will be very cold".   "I don't know", 
I told him, "except that I will be here".   "I shall 
see about getting you a tent", he said. "I have a small sports shop 
in Strasbourg".   That would be a great help, I told him, 
thanking him for his thoughtfulness. A special guard was posted at 
my end of the bridge to make sure I didn't cross, the ludicrousness 
of the situation being revealed fully in that everyone else- men, 
women, and children, dogs, cats, horses, cars, trucks, baby carriages- 
could cross Kehl bridge into Kehl without surveillance.   The 
day passed eventfully enough, with a constant stream of visitors, some 
stopping only to say hello, others getting into serious conversations, 
such as one Andre Fuchs, a free-lance journalist from Strasbourg 
who wrote an article for the <Nouvelle Alsatian> in highly sympathetic 
terms. Some students from the University returned around six 
with a large pot containing enough hot soup to last me a week. A volunteer 
food brigade had been arranged, they told me, which would supply 
me with the necessities as long as I remained at the bridge. A little 
later, the sports shop man returned with a small pup tent. One of 
the girl students, sitting by while I ate the thick soup, asked me if 
I had a sleeping bag. When I informed her that I didn't, she said 
she would borrow her brother's and bring it to me later that evening.

"You do not know me", she said in good English, "but 
my mother was your governess in Philadelphia when you were a child". 
Her name was Esther Peter. I was delighted to make that personal 
contact in such trying and unusual circumstances. The Peter family 
proved wonderful and helpful friends in the following days, Mrs& 
Peter, little Esther, and Raoul, who generously lent me his sleeping 
bag for my "Watch on the Rhine".   Sighting a line from 
the bridge to a small field directly to the side, I pitched the tent 
that evening on the stateless "line", digging a small trench around 
it as best I could with a toy spade donated by a neighborhood child. 
The wind from the Rhine was damp and chill, necessitating a fire 
for warmth. After scouring around a bit in the open area, I came across 
what proved to be tar-soaked logs which crackled and burned brightly, 
giving off vast rolls of smoke into the ashen sky.   Each evening 
the students appeared with the soup kettle and several <petits 
pains>, Esther usually being among them. I had advised friends to 
write me to "No Man's Land, Pont Kehl, Between Strasbourg and 
Kehl, France-Germany". Sure enough, mail began trickling in, 
delivered by a talkative, highly amused French postman who informed me 
there had been quite a debate at the post office as to whether that 
address would be recognized.   On Christmas Eve, students brought 
out two small Christmas trees which I placed on either side of the 
tent. As the field on which my tent was pitched was a favorite natural 
playground for the kids of the neighborhood, I had made many friends 
among them, taking part in their after-school games and trying desperately 
to translate Grimm's Fairy Tales into an understandable 
French as we gathered around the fire in front of the tent. To my great 
surprise and delight, when they saw the two trees they went rushing 
off, returning shortly with decorations from their own trees.

It was a merry if somewhat soggy Christmas for me that year. ## 

In the mail were invitations to speak at the universities of Cologne, 
Heidelberg, and Baden-Baden. Twenty thousand world citizens at 
Stuttgart had signed a petition inviting me to visit their town. When 
Dr& Adenauer was approached by a world citizen delegation to find 
out his disposition of my case, he gave them his personal approval 
of my entry, saying that all men advocating peace should be welcomed into 
Germany. The special guard, however, was still posted on Kehl bridge.

As it began raining at around eight o'clock on December 
26th, I retired into my tent early, somewhat tired and discouraged, 
my body reacting sluggishly 
because of the continued exposure. No matter 
how large the fire, I couldn't seem to shake off the chill that 
day.   "Oh, Mr& Davis, are you there"? a voice drifted 
in to me above the patter of the rain shortly after I had fallen 
into a fitful sleep.   "Who is it"?   "We're from 
the Council of Europe, British delegation. May we have a word with 
you"?   "I'm sorry. I've had a trying day and I just 
can't make it out again", I told them.   I heard nothing 
more. Later I learned that Sir Hugh Dalton had expressed a desire 
to see me, hence their trip to "No Man's Land".   On 
the evening of December 27th, Esther noticed my pallid look and rasping 
voice. She entreated me to see a doctor, and when I refused, brought 
one out to see me. He advised immediate hospitalization. I wouldn't 
hear of it because it meant giving up the "line", though I 
realized I was in poor shape physically. Esther, mistaking my hesitation, 
assured me that the hospital expense would be taken care of by 
a leading merchant in Strasbourg whom she had already approached.

"No, it's not that", I told her. "You see, once I relinquish 
the position I've already established here, I couldn't regain 
it without sacrificing the logic of it".   At that moment, 
up walked a tall young man with glasses who announced himself as a 
world citizen from Basel, Switzerland. Without preliminaries, Esther 
asked him, "If you are a world citizen, will you take Garry Davis' 
place in his tent while he goes to the hospital"?   "But 
of course, with pleasure", he replied.   Esther looked at 
me. I looked from her to him.   "What is your name"? I 
asked him.   "Jean Babel".   "Shake", I said. "You 
have just enlisted for the 'Rhine Campaign'".   Esther 
jumped up, ran to him and gave him a little hug.   "I am 
so happy. Now come, Garry, we must go quickly. There is a police car 
outside. Maybe they will take us".   Such were the incongruities 
of the situation that the very police assigned to check up on me 
were drafted into driving me to the Strasbourg Hospital while World 
Citizen Jean Babel waved adieu from the "Line"! 
He remembered every detail of his pre-assault movements but nothing of 
the final, desperate rush to come to grips with the enemy. When the 
victory cheer went up this officer found himself still mounted, with 
his 
horse pressed broadside against Cleburne's log parapet in a tangled 
group of infantrymen. His hat was gone, the tears were streaming 
from his eyes. He never knew how he got there. Six climactic minutes 
in an individual's life left no memory.   Eight hundred and sixty-five 
Rebels surrendered within their works and a thousand more were 
captured or surrendered themselves that night and the next day. Eight 
field guns were captured in position. Seven battle flags and fourteen 
officers' swords were sent to Thomas' headquarters. It was 
the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks 
successfully made by either side during the Atlanta campaign. The 
Fourteenth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers lost one-third of its numbers 
within a few minutes, among them being several men whose time of service 
had expired but who had volunteered to advance with their regiment. 
The Thirty-eighth Regiment of Ohio Volunteers, one of the regiments 
in Thomas' First Division during Buell's command, suffered 
its greatest loss of the war in this action.   A popular belief 
grew up after the war that the only time during the Civil War that 
Thomas ever put his horse to a gallop was when he went to hurry up 
Stanley for this assault. Sherman was responsible for the story when 
he said in his memoirs that this was the only time he could recall 
seeing Thomas ride so fast. While Thomas' injured back led him to 
restrain his mount from its most violent gait he moved quickly enough 
when he had to. It is not in the record, but he must have galloped his 
horse at Peach Tree Creek when he brought up Ward's guns to save 
Newton's crumbling line.   While the final combat of the 
campaign was being worked out at Jonesborough, Thomas, on Sherman's 
instructions, ordered Slocum, now commanding the Twentieth Corps, 
to make an effort to occupy Atlanta if he could do so without exposing 
his bridgehead to a counterattack. The dispatch must have been sent 
after sundown on September 1. Slocum made his reconnaissanace the 
next morning, found the town empty, accepted the surrender of the mayor 
and occupied the city a little before noon.   On the morning 
of September 2 the Fourth Corps and the Armies of the Tennessee and 
the Ohio followed the line of Hardee's retreat. About noon they 
came up with the enemy two miles from Lovejoy's Station and deployed. 
The Fourth Corps assaulted and carried a small portion of the 
enemy works but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation 
from the balance of the line. That night a note written in 
Slocum's hand and dated from inside the captured city came to Sherman 
stating that the Twentieth Corps was in possession of Atlanta. 
Before making the news public Sherman sent an officer with the note 
to Thomas. In a short time the officer returned and Thomas followed 
on his heels. The cautious Thomas re-examined the note and then, making 
up his mind that it was genuine, snapped his fingers, whistled and 
almost danced in his exuberance.   The next day Sherman issued 
his orders ending the campaign and pulled his armies back to Atlanta. 
The measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign is a matter 
of personal choice. Sherman laid great store by place captures. 
Hood refused to notice anything except captured guns and colors. By 
both standards Thomas had the right to be proud.   Thomas thanked 
his men for their tenacity of purpose, unmurmuring endurance, cheerful 
obedience, brilliant heroism and high qualities in battle. 
Sherman felt that his own part in the campaign was skillful and well 
executed but that the slowness of a part of his army robbed him of the 
larger fruits of victory. He supposed the military world would approve 
of his accomplishment.   Whatever the military world thought, 
the political world approved it wholeheartedly. For some time, despondency 
in some Northern quarters had been displayed in two ways- an 
eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with Lincoln. Proposals 
were in the air for a year's armistice. Lincoln was sure that he would 
not be re-elected. In the midst of this gloom, at 10:05 P&M& 
on September 2, Slocum's telegram to Stanton, "General Sherman 
has taken Atlanta", shattered the talk of a negotiated peace 
and boosted Lincoln into the White House. To the Republicans no 
victory 
could have been more complete.   Official congratulations 
showered upon Sherman and his army. Lincoln mentioned their distinguished 
ability, courage and perseverance. He felt that this campaign would 
be famous in the annals of war. Grant called it prompt, skillful 
and brilliant. Halleck described it as the most brilliant of the war.

Actually the Atlanta campaign was a military failure. Next 
best to destroying an army is to deprive it of its freedom of action. 
Sherman had accomplished this much of his job and then inexplicably 
nullified it by his thirty-mile retreat from Lovejoy's to Atlanta. 
But, so far as its territorial objectives were concerned, the campaign 
was successful. Within the narrow frame of military tactics, too, 
the experts agree that the campaign was brilliant. In seventeen weeks 
the military front was driven southward more than 100 miles. There 
was a battle on an average of once every three weeks. The skirmishing 
was almost constant. In the summary of the principal events of the campaign 
compiled from the official records there are only ten days which 
show no fighting. The casualties in the Army of the Cumberland were 
22,807, while for all three armies they were 37,081. Men were killed 
in their camps, at their meals and in their sleep. Rifle fire often 
kept the opposing gunners from manning their pieces. Modern warfare 
was born in this campaign- periscopes, camouflage, booby traps, land 
mines, extended order, trench raids, foxholes, armored cars, night 
attacks, flares, sharpshooters in trees, interlaced vines and treetops, 
which were the forerunners of barbed wire, trip wires to thwart a cavalry 
charge, which presaged the mine trap, and the general use of anesthetics. 
The use of map coordinates was begun when the senior officers 
began to select tactical points by designating a spot as "near the 
letter ~o in the word mountain". A few weeks later the maps were 
being divided into squares and a position was described as being "about 
lots 239, 247 and 272 with pickets forward as far as 196". This 
system was dependent upon identical maps and Thomas supplied them 
from a mobile lithograph press. 
Orders of the day began to specify the 
standard map for the movement.   Sherman proved that a railway 
base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the Atlanta 
campaign was the rapid repair of the tracks. To the Rebels it seemed 
as if Sherman carried tunnels and bridges in his pockets. The whistle 
of Sherman's locomotives often drowned out the rattle of the skirmish 
fire. As always, the ranks worked out new and better tactics, but 
there was brilliance in the way the field commands adopted these methods 
and in the way the army commanders incorporated them into their 
military thinking. The fossilized, formalized, precedent-based thinking 
of the legendary military brain was not evident in Sherman's armies. 
Sherman could never be accused of sticking too long with the old.

One of Sherman's most serious shortcomings, however, was 
his mistrust of his cavalry. He never saw that it was a complement to 
his infantry and not a substitute for it. Then, in some way, this lack 
of faith in the cavalry became mixed up in his mind with the dragging 
effect of wagon trains and was hardened into a prejudice. A horse 
needed twenty pounds of food a day but the infantryman got along with 
two pounds. The horseman required eleven times more than the footman. 
So Sherman tried a compromise. He would ship by rail five pounds per 
day per animal and the other fifteen pounds that were needed could 
be picked up off the country. It failed to work. Already debilitated 
by the Chattanooga starvation, the quality of Sherman's horseflesh 
ran downhill as the campaign progressed. Every recorded request by 
Thomas for a delay in a flank movement or an advance was to gain time 
to take care 
of his horses.   Well led, properly organized cavalry, 
in its complementary role to infantry, had four functions. First, 
it could locate the enemy infantry, learn what they were doing, and hold 
them until the heavy foot columns could come up and take over. Second, 
it could screen its own infantry from the sight of the enemy. Third, 
it could threaten at all times, and destroy when possible, the enemy 
communications. It could reach key tactical points faster than infantry 
and destroy them or hold them as the case might be for the foot 
soldier. Its climactic role was to pursue and demoralize a defeated 
enemy but this chance never came in the Atlanta campaign. Thomas tried 
hard to have his cavalry ready for the test it was to meet, but his 
plans were wrecked when it was forced into a campaign without optimum 
mobility and with its commander stripped from it.   Sherman knew 
the uses of cavalry as well as Thomas but he imagined a moving base 
with infantry wings instead of cavalry wings. His conception proved 
workable but slower and it enabled his enemy to make clean, deft, well 
organized retreats with small materiel losses. Sherman insisted that 
cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railways, yet Garrard's 
Covington raid and Rousseau's Opelika raid cut two-thirds 
of the rail lines he had to break and Sherman lived in mortal fear of 
what Forrest might do to his communications.   When McPherson 
pushed blindly through Snake Creek Gap in a potentially decisive 
movement, the only cavalry in his van was the Ninth Illinois Mounted 
Infantry, totally inadequate for its role. It stumbled on infantry 
where no infantry should have been and McPherson's aggressive impulse 
faded out, overwhelmed by fears of the unknown. A proper cavalry 
command in his front would have developed the fact that he had run into 
one division of Polk's Army of the Mississippi moving up from 
the direction of Mobile to join Johnston at Dalton. From the night 
of August 30 to the morning of September 2 there was no Union cavalry 
east of the Macon railway to disclose to Sherman that he was missing 
the greatest opportunity of his career. A great part of the time, 
Thomas' infantry never knew the location of the enemy line. At such 
times Thomas wondered when and where a counterattack would strike 
him. It was the hard way to fight a war but Thomas did it without making 
any disastrous mistakes.   Heat during the Atlanta campaign, 
coupled with unsuitable clothing, caused individual irritation that 
was compounded by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean 
clothing. To relieve the itch and sweat galls, the men got into the 
water whenever they could and since each sizable stream was generally 
the dividing line between the armies the pickets declared a private 
truce while the men went swimming. Johnston believed that Sherman put 
his naked engineers into the swimming parties to locate the various 
fords. Lieutenant Colonel James P& Brownlow, who commanded the 
First Brigade of Thomas' First Cavalry Division, was ordered across 
one of these fords. The water was deep and Brownlow took his troopers 
across naked- except for guns, cartridge boxes and hats. They 
kicked their horses through the deep water with their bare heels, drove 
the Rebels out of their rifle pits and captured four men. Most of 
the Rebels got away since they could make better time through the stiff 
brush than their naked pursuers.   Rank was becoming an explosive 
issue in all three of Sherman's armies. Merited recommendations 
from army commanders were passed over in favor of political appointees 
from civil life.

In one of the very few letters in which he ever complained of 
Meynell, Thompson told Patmore of his distress at having had to leave 
London before this new friendship had developed further: "

That was a very absurd and annoying situation in which I was placed 
by 
W& M&'s curious methods of handling me. He never let me know 
that my visit was about to terminate until the actual morning I was 
to leave for Lymington. The result was that I found myself in the 
ridiculous position of having made a formal engagement by letter for 
the next week, only two days before my departure from London. Luckily 
both women knew my position and if anyone suffered in their opinion 
it was not I". It need hardly be remarked that Thompson was not 
generally known for his scrupulosity about keeping his social engagements, 
which makes his irritation in this letter all the more significant.

When Thompson and her daughter began a correspondence which 
included fervent verses from Pantasaph, Mrs& King felt a proper 
Victorian alarm. Some, she knew, looked upon Thompson almost as a 
saint, 
but others read in "The Hound of Heaven" what they took to 
be the confessions of a great sinner, who, like Oscar Wilde, had- 
as one pious writer later put it- thrown himself "on the swelling 
wave of every passion".   Consequently, on October 31, 1896, 
Mrs& King wrote to Thompson, quite against her daughter's wishes, 
asking him not to "recommence a correspondence which I believe 
has been dropped for some weeks". Katherine was staying at a convent, 
and her mother felt that, as Thompson himself seems to have suggested, 
she might eventually stay there. This prospect did not please Mrs& 
King any more than did the possibility that her daughter might 
marry a Bohemian, but she used it to suggest to Thompson that, 
"It 
is not in her nature to love you".   For his part, Thompson 
had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an 
honorable friendship between Katie and himself. At no time does he 
seem to have proposed marriage, and Mrs& King was evidently torn between 
a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe 
that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation. 
In any case, she told Thompson that she saw no reason why he might 
not see Katie again, "now that this frank explanation has been made 
+ no one can misunderstand". She ended her letter with the assurance 
that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself 
to be an honor, from which she could not part "without still more pain".

After Thompson came to London to live, he received a 
letter from Katie, which was dated February 8, 1897. She regretted 
what she described as the "unwarrantable + unnecessary" check to their 
friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another 
perfectly. This letter concluded with an invitation: "  I 
am a great deal at the little children's Hospital. Mr& Meynell 
knows the way. I know you are very busy now, you are writing a great 
deal + your book is coming out, isn't it? but if you are able + care 
to come, you know how glad I shall be.   Ever yours sincerely,

Katherine Douglas King" The invitation was accepted and 
other letters followed, in which she spoke of her concern for his health 
and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled 
children she served. It is difficult to say what Thompson expected 
would come of their relationship, which had begun so soon after his emotions 
had been stirred by Maggie Brien, but when Katie wrote on April 
11, 1900, to tell him that she was to be married to the Rev& Godfrey 
Burr, the vicar of Rushall in Staffordshire, the news evidently 
helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes 
for a new volume of verse. In a letter to Meynell, which was written 
in June, less than a month before Katie's wedding, he was highly 
melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of 
returning to the life of the streets: "  A week in arrears, 
and without means to pay, I must go, it is the only right thing. **h 
Perhaps Mrs& Meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep 
my own copy of the first edition of my first book, with all its mementos 
of her and the dear ones. **h Last, not least, there are some poems 
which K& King sent me (addressed to herself) when I was preparing 
a fresh volume, asking me to include them. The terrible blow of 
the New Year put an end to that project. I wish you would return them 
to her. I have not the heart. **h I never had the courage to look 
at them, when my projected volume became hopeless, fearing they were 
poor, until now when I was obliged to do so. **h O my genius, young 
and <ripening,> you would swear,- when I wrote them; and now! 
What has it all come to? All chance of fulfilling my destiny is 
over. **h I want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems, dear 
father-brother, now I am gone; and launch them on the world when their 
time comes. For them a box will be lodgment enough. **h Katie cannot 
mind your seeing them now; since my silence must have ended when 
I gave the purposed volume to you. **h I ask you to do me the last 
favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening, about which time I shall 
come to say my sad good-bye. If you don't think much of them, tell 
me the wholesome truth. If otherwise, you will give me a pleasure. 
O Wilfrid! it is strange; but this- yes, <terrible> step I 
am about to take **h is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found 
hope that here, in these poems, is treasure- or at least some 
measure of beauty, which I did not know of". **h Thompson, of 
course, 
was persuaded not to take the <"terrible> step"; Meynell once 
again paid his debts and it was Katie, rather than Thompson, whose 
life was soon ended, for she died in childbirth in April, 1901, in 
the first year of her marriage.   The "orphaned poems" mentioned 
in the letter to Meynell comprised a group of five sonnets, which 
were published in the 1913 edition of Thompson's works under the 
heading "Ad Amicam", plus certain other completed pieces and rough 
drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books. The 
publication of Father Connolly's <The Man Has Wings> has made 
more of the group available in print so that a general picture of 
what it contained can now be had without difficulty. Some of the poems 
express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love; others suggest its 
coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final 
separation.   The somewhat Petrarchan love story which these 
poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more 
than a little of autobiographical sincerity. When they were first 
written, there was evidently no thought of their being published, and 
those which refer to the writer's love for Mrs& Meynell particularly 
have the ring of truth. In "My Song's Young Virgin Date", 
for example, Thompson wrote: "Yea, she that had my song's 
young virgin date Not now, alas, that noble singular she, I nobler 
hold, though marred from her once state, Than others in their best integrity. 
My own stern hand has rent the ancient bond, And thereof shall 
the ending not have end: But not for me, that loved her, to be 
fond Lightly to please me with a newer friend. Then hold it more than 
bravest-feathered song, That I affirm to thee, with heart of pride, 
I knew not what did to a friend belong Till I stood up, true friend, 
by thy true side; Whose absence dearer comfort is, by far, Than 
presences of other women are"!   Taking into account Thompson's 
capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish 
to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known 
unhappy loves, there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for 
Katie King. That she was affected by his protestations seems obvious, 
but since she was evidently a sensible young woman- as well as 
an outgoing and sympathetic type- it would seem that for her the word 
<friendship> had a far less intense emotional significance than that 
which Thompson gave it. From the outset, she must have realized that 
marriage with him was out of the question, and although she was displeased 
by the "unwarrantable" interference, it seems probable that 
she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was "perhaps" 
a man "most fitted to live + die solitary, + in the love 
only of the Highest Lover".   The poems which were addressed 
to her, while they are far more restrained than those of "Love in 
Dian's Lap", show no great technical advance over those of the "Narrow 
Vessel" group and are, if anything, somewhat more labored. 
Their interest remains chiefly biographical, for they throw some light 
on the utter despair which overtook Thompson in the spring and early 
summer of 1900.   Whether or not Danchin is correct in suggesting 
that Thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from 
this period is, of course, a matter of conjecture. Reid simply states, 
without offering any supporting evidence, that "after he returned 
to London, he resumed his draughts of laudanum, and continued this 
right up to his death". There is every reason to recognize that in 
the very last years of his life, as we shall see, Thompson did take 
the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness, 
but the exact date at which this began has never been determined. If, 
as Reid says, "nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not 
taking opium", there may be some reason to doubt that he was under 
its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the 
poems to Katie King and making plans for another book of verse. In 
any event, the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that 
if he was taking laudanum, it was never in command of him to the extent 
that it had been during his vagrant years.   Meynell's remedy 
for Thompson's despondent mood was typically practical. He simply 
found more work for him to do, and the articles and reviews continued 
without an evident break. #@ /3, @#

As a reviewer, Thompson 
generally displayed a judicious attitude. That he read some 
of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from 
his notes, which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable 
basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without 
his signature. On the basis of this careful reading, Thompson frequently 
gave a clear, complete, and interesting description of a prose work 
or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry.

He was seldom an unmethodical critic, and his reviews generally 
followed a systematic pattern: a description of what the work 
contained, a treatment of the things that had especially interested him 
in it, and, wherever possible, a balancing of whatever artistic merits 
and faults he might have found.   It was, of course, in this 
drawing 
of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire 
to do full justice to an author. Reviewing Davidson's <The 
Testament of an Empire Builder,> for example, Thompson found 
that 
there was "too much metrical dialectic". Poetry, he said, must be 
"dogmatic": it must not stoop to argue like a "K&C& in 
cloth-of-gold". Yet Davidson impressed him as a poet capable of "sustained 
power, passion, or beauty", and he cited specific passages 
to illustrate not only these qualities but Davidson's command of 
imagery as well. Similarly, he wrote that Laurence Housman had a "too 
deliberate manner" as well as a lack of "inevitable felicity 
in diction". But he admired Housman's "subtle intellectuality" 
and delighted in the inversion by which Divine Love becomes the most 
"fatal" allurement in "Love the Tempter".   Of course, 
there were books about which nothing good could be said. Understanding, 
as he did, the difficulty of the art of poetry, and believing 
that the "only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of 
poets", he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please 
when it came to the review of a book of verse.

As he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half 
before, Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec. 
Thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into Podolia 
and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan. There, along the east bank 
of the Southern Bug, opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli a few miles 
north of the Black Sea, he arrived at General Headquarters of the 
Russian Army. By June 19, 1788, he had presented himself to its Commander 
in Chief, the Governor of the Southern Provinces, the Director 
of the War College- The Prince. ##

Catherine's first 
war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty 
quite favorable to her. By 1783 her legions had managed to annex the 
Crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now, in this second combat with 
the Crescent, were aiming at suzerainty over all of the Black Sea's 
northern shoreline.   Through most of 1787 operations on 
both sides had been lackadaisical; those of 1788 were going to prove 
decisive, though many of their details are obscure. To consolidate what 
her Navy had won, the Czarina was fortunate that, for the first 
time in Russian history, her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command 
under her favorite Giaour. Potemkin was directing this conflict 
on three fronts: in the Caucasus; along the Danube and among the 
Carpathians, in alliance with the Emperor Joseph's armies; and 
in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of Nogay Tartary 
and Taurida, including the Crimean peninsula. Here the war would 
flame to its focus, and here Lewis Littlepage had come.   Potemkin's 
Army of Ekaterinoslav, totaling, it was claimed, 40,000 regular 
troops and 6,000 irregulars of the Cossack Corps, had invested 
Islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea, 
the fortress town of Oczakov, and was preparing to test the Turk by 
land and sea. During a sojourn of slightly more than three months Chamberlain 
Littlepage sould see action on both elements.   As his 
second in command The Prince had Marshal Repnin, one-time Ambassador 
to Poland. Repnin, who had a rather narrow face, longish nose, 
high forehead, and arching brows, looked like a quizzical Mephistopheles. 
Some people thought he lacked both ability and character, but 
most 
agreed that he was noble in appearance and, for a Russian, humane. 
The Marshal came to know Littlepage quite well. At General Headquarters 
the newcomer in turn got to know others. There was the Neapolitan, 
Ribas, a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith 
but who had fawned his way up the ladder of Catherine's and Potemkin's 
favor till he was now a brigadier (and would one day be the daggerman 
designated to do in Czar Paul /1,, after traveling all the 
way 
to Naples to procure just the right stiletto).   Then there were 
the distinguished foreign volunteers. Representing the Emperor were 
the Prince de Ligne, still as impetuous as a youth of twenty; and 
General the Count Pallavicini, founder of the Austrian branch of 
that celebrated Italian house, a courtier Littlepage could have met 
at Madrid in December, 1780. From Milan came the young Chevalier 
de Litta, an officer in the service of Malta. Out of Saxony rode 
the Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, one of the Czarina's cousins and 
a lieutenant general in her armies, a frank, sensitive, popular soldier 
whose kindnesses Littlepage would "always recall with the sincerest 
gratitude".   Though Catherine was vexed at the number of 
French officers streaming to the Turkish standard, there were several 
under her own, such as the Prince de Nassau; the energetic Parisian, 
Roger de Damas, three year's Littlepage's junior, to whom 
Nassau had taken a liking; and the artillerist, Colonel Prevost, 
whom the Count de Segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills 
to Nassau. England contributed a young subaltern named Newton and 
the naval architect Samuel Bentham, brother to the economist, who far 
his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the Russian fleet. 
From America were the Messrs& Littlepage and Jones. 
Lewis had expected to report at once to Jones's and Nassau's naval 
command post. On arrival at headquarters he had, however- in King 
Stanislas' words to Glayre- "found such favor with ~Pe 
Potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want 
him to go join Paul Jones **h". So of course he stayed put. Having 
done so, he began to experience all the frustrations of others who 
attempted to get along with Serenissimus and do a job at the same 
time.   The Prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous, 
but these qualities were sapped by an Oriental lethargy and 
a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions. At headquarters- 
sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally 
that you were in a war- Lewis found that the Commander 
in Chief's only desk was his knees (and his only comb, his fingers). 
An entire theater had been set up for his diversion, with a 200-man 
Italian orchestra under the well-known Sarti. In the great one's 
personal quarters, a portable house, almost every evening saw an elegant 
banquet or reception. Lewis could let his eye caress The Prince's 
divan, covered with a rose-pink and silver Turkish cloth, or admire 
the lovely tapis, interwoven with gold, that spread across the floor. 
Filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of Araby. Around the 
billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals. 
At dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red 
capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers, marching in 
pairs like guards from a stage tragedy.   Among the visitors arriving 
every now and then there were, of course, women. For if Serenissimus 
made the sign of the Cross with his right hand, and meant it, 
with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his 
eye. Usually Lewis would find at headquarters one or more of The 
Prince's various nieces.   Right now he found Sophie de Witt, 
that magnificent young matron he had spotted at Kamieniec fours years 
ago. The Prince took her with him on every tour around the area, 
and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of Constantinople 
as part of his espionage network. One evening he passed around the banquet 
table a crystal cup full of diamonds, requesting every female guest 
to select one as a souvenir. When a lady chanced to soil a pair of 
evening slippers, Brigadier Bauer was dispatched to Paris for replacements.

But if The Prince fancied women and was fascinated 
by foreigners, he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates. 
He had collared one of his generals in public. His coat trimmed 
in sable, diamond stars of the Orders of Saints Andrew or George agleam, 
he was often prone to sit sulkily, eye downcast, in a Scheherazade 
trance. When this happened, everything stopped. As Littlepage 
noted: "A complete picture of Prince Potemkin may be had in his 
1788 operations. He stays inactive for half the summer in front of Oczakov, 
a quite second-rate spot, begins to besiege it <formally> only 
during the autumn rains, and finally carries it <by assault> in 
the heart of winter. There's a man who never goes by the ordinary road 
but still arrives at his goal, who gratuitously gets himself into 
difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat, in a word a man who creates 
monsters for himself in order to appear a <Hercules> in destroying 
them".   To help him do so The Prince had conferred control 
of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost 
every respect save one: both were eccentrics of the purest ray 
serene.   Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov, now in his fifty-ninth 
year (ten years Potemkin's senior), was a thin, worn-faced person 
of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany. He 
had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side, a large flat nose, 
and penetrating blue eyes. His gray hair was thin, his face beginning 
to attract a swarm of wrinkles. He was ugly. But Suvorov's face 
was also a theater of vivacity, and his tough, stooping little frame 
was briskness embodied. Like all Russians he was an emotional man, 
and in him the emotions warred. Kind by nature, he never refused charity 
to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it (as Lewis would 
one day discover). But he was perpetually engaged in a battle to 
command his own temper.   When Littlepage was introduced, if the 
General behaved as usual, the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries: 
origin? age? mission? current status? Woe betide the 
interviewee if he answered vaguely. Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's 
was proverbial; better to give an asinine answer than none 
at all. Despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier, he slept on a 
pile of hay with his cloak as blanket. He rose at 4:00 A&M& the 
year round and 
was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake 
his men. His breakfast was tea; his dinner fell anywhere from nine 
to noon; his supper was nothing. He hadn't worn a watch or carried 
pocket money for years because he disliked both, but highest among 
his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched one from an officer's 
grasp and smashed it to smithereens. He kept several pet birds 
and liked cats well enough that if one crept by, he would mew at it in 
friendly fashion. Passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark.

Yet General Suvorov- who had never forgotten hearing his adored 
Czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities- was mad 
only north, northwest. He had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity 
allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at Court; in 
camp he knew it won you the affection of your men. He had accordingly 
cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature. Underneath, he 
remained one of the best-educated Russians of his day. He dabbled 
in verse, could get along well among most of the European languages, 
and was fluent in French and German. He had also mastered the Cossack 
tongue.   For those little men with the short whiskers, shaven 
polls, and top knots Suvorov reserved a special esteem. Potemkin- 
as King Stanislas knew, and presently informed Littlepage- looked 
on the Cossacks as geopolitical tools. To Serenissimus such tribes 
as the Cossacks of the Don or those ex-bandits the Zaporogian 
Cossacks 
(in whose islands along the lower Dnieper the Polish novelist 
Sienkiewicz would one day place <With Fire and Sword>) were just 
elements for enforced resettlement in, say, Bessarabia, where, as 
"the faithful of the Black Sea borders", he could use their presence 
as baragining points in the Czarina's territorial claims against 
Turkey. Suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic 
units but military men of a high potential. He knew how to 
channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere 
plunderers into A-1 guerrilla 
fighters. He always kept a few on his 
personal staff. He often donned their tribal costumes, such as the 
one featuring a tall, black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled 
a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels; 
broad red stripes down the trouser leg; broader leather belt round 
the waist, holding cartridges and light sabre. Suvorov played parent 
not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops. It was probably at 
this period that Littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary 
Russian soldier.   These illiterate boors conscripted from villages 
all across the Czarina's empire had, Suvorov may have told Lewis, 
just two things a commander could count on: physical fitness and 
personal courage. When their levies came shambling into camp, they 
were all elbows, hair, and beard. They emerged as interchangeable cogs 
in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked, hair queued, 
greatcoated, jackbooted, and best of all- in the opinion of the 
British professional, Major Semple-Lisle- "their minds are not 
estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge 
which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny". 
Mando, pleading her cause, must have said that Dr& Brown was the 
most distinguished physician in the United States of America, for 
our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating 
the irregularity of his pulse. "He's got high blood pressure, too, 
and bum kidneys", the doctor said to me. "Transparent look, waxy 
skin- could well be uremia". He looked disapprovingly at an ash 
tray piled high with cigarette stubs, shook his head, and moved his 
hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture. The little official 
hung his head in shame. Seeing this, his colleague at the next desk 
gave a short, contemptuous laugh, pushed forward his own ash tray, innocent 
of a single butt, thumped his chest to show his excellent condition, 
and looked proud. The doctor gravely nodded approval.

At this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem 
was solved and all Norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers. We 
went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents 
and more officials awaited us, the rest of the office personnel hot 
upon our heels. By this time word had got around that an American doctor 
was on the premises. One fellow who had liver spots held out his 
hands to the great healer. It was funny but it was also touching. "You 
know", Norton said to me later, "I am thinking of setting 
up the Klinico Brownapopolus. I might not make any money but I'd 
sure have patients".   After luncheon we took advantage of 
the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our 
dear friend Deppy had written. Deppy is Despina Messinesi, a long-time 
member of the <Vogue> staff who, although born in Boston, was 
born there 
of Greek parents. Several years of her life have been spent in 
the homeland, and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming. 
"All you have to do, Ilka dear, is to phone on your arrival. 
They are longing to see you". The wear and tear of life have taught 
me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers, 
but I planned on being the soul of tact, of giving them plenty 
of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already 
running over without us. My diplomacy was needless. Greek phone service 
is worse than French, so that it was to be some little time before 
contact of any sort was established.   In the late afternoon 
Mando came back to fetch us, and we drove to the Acropolis. We stopped 
first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned 
by the Parthenon. The curving benches are broken, chipped, tumbled, 
but still in place, as are the marble chairs, the seats of honor 
for the legislators. The carved statues of the frieze against the low 
wall are for the most part headless, but their exquisitely graceful nude 
and draped torsos and the kneeling Atlantes are well preserved in 
their perfect proportion.   Having completed our camera work, we 
started our climb. I suppose the same emotion holds, if to a lesser 
degree, with any famous monument. Will it live up to its reputation? 
The weight of fame and history is formidable, and dreary steel engravings 
in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination. Uh 
huh, we think, looking at them, so that's the Parthenon. And then 
perhaps one day we get to Athens. We are here! We've come a 
long way and spent a lot of money. It had better be good. Don't worry 
about the Acropolis. It is awe-inspiring. Probably every visitor 
has a favorite time for his first sight of it. We saw it frequently 
afterward, but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset. 
The light at that time is a benediction. The serene, majestic 
columns of the Parthenon, tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky, 
frame incredible vistas. All we wanted to do was to stand very quietly 
and look and look and look.   More than twenty-four hundred 
years old, bruised, battered, worn and partially destroyed, combining 
to an astounding degree solidity and grace, it still stands, incomparable 
testimony to man's aspiration. In 1687 the Turks, who had been 
in control of the city since the fifteenth century, with a truly shattering 
lack of prudence used the Parthenon as a powder magazine. It 
was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding Venetian army and the great 
central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens.   Nearby 
is the temple of Athena. The architectural feature, the caryatides 
upholding the portico, famous around the world as the Porch of the 
Maidens, was referred to airily by Mando as the Girls' Place. 
Another beautiful building is the Propylaea, the entrance gate of the 
Acropolis.   My other nugget of art and architectural knowledge- 
besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed the doors 
of the baptistery in Florence- is the three styles of Greek columns. 
For some happy reason Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian have always 
stuck in my mind. Furthermore I can identify each design. It remained, 
however, for Mando to teach me that Doric symbolized strength, 
Ionic wisdom, and Corinthian beauty, the three pillars of the ancient 
world. The columns of the Parthenon are fluted Doric.   Another 
classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the evzone sentry, 
in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes, who was patrolling 
up and down in front of the palace. Gun on shoulder, he would 
march smartly for a few yards, bring his heels together with a click, 
make a brisk pirouette, skirts flaring, and march back to his point 
of departure. We did not dare speak to so exalted a being, but Norton 
aimed his camera and shot him, so to speak, on the rise, the split second 
between the halt and the turn.   The evening of our first 
day we drove with Christopher and Judy Sakellariadis, who were friends 
and patients of Norton, to dine at a restaurant on the shores of 
the Aegean. On the way out Mr& Sakellariadis detoured up a special 
hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the Acropolis lighted 
by night.   The great spectacle was a source of rancor, and 
Son et Lumiere, which the French were trying to promote with the 
Athenians, 
was the reason. These performances were being staged at historical 
monuments throughout Europe. By a combination of music, lighting 
effects, and narration, famous events that have transpired in 
these 
locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to 
considerable acclaim. The Acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment 
too, but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full 
moon when the Athenians themselves, out of respect for the natural beauty 
of the occasion, were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination.

Athenian society was split into two factions, the Philistines 
and the Artists. The Artists contended that the Philistines, 
gross of soul, were all for having Son et Lumiere, since the 
French were footing the bill and the attraction, wherever it had been 
done, had proven popular. This was the crassest kind of materialism 
and they, the Artists, would have no truck with it. The Acropolis 
was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight 
wasn't enough for both natives and tourists, then they were quite 
simply barbarians 
and the hell with them. It was very stimulating.

The restaurant to which the Sakellariadises took us on this night 
of controversy was the Asteria, on Asteria beach. This is a public 
bathing beach, easily accessible by tramway from the center of Athens. 
Office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during 
the siesta period, which, during the summer, lasts from two until five 
in the afternoon, when shops and offices are again open for business. 
They close sometime after eight. Nine o'clock is the rush hour, 
when the busses are jammed, and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning 
to fill. Bedtime is late, for the balmy evenings are delightful 
and everyone wants to linger under the stars.   The sand is fine 
and pleasant, the cabanas are clean, and the parasols, green, raspberry, 
and butter yellow, are very gay. Although open to the general 
public it is not overcrowded; the atmosphere is that of an attractive 
private beach club at home. We went there a couple of times to swim 
and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. This agreeable state of affairs is 
explicable, I think, on two counts. One is Greece is not yet suffering 
from overpopulation. The public may still find pleasure in public 
places. The other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols, though 
modest from an American point of view, still is a little high for 
many Athenians. We were struck by the notable absence of banana skins 
and beer cans, but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on Greek 
refinement, perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable 
radios. Greek boys and girls also go for rock-and-roll, and the stations 
most tuned to are those carrying United States overseas programs. 
A good deal of English was spoken on the beach, most educated Greeks 
learn it in childhood, and there were also American wives and 
children of our overseas servicemen.   For a delightful drive out 
of Athens I should recommend Sounion, at the end of the Attic Peninsula. 
The road, a comparatively new one, is very good, winding along 
inlets, coves, and bays of deep and brilliant blue. I suppose the 
day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments, 
but at present it is deserted and seductive. Three beneficial 
hurdles to progress are the lack of water, electricity, and telephones.

At Sounion there is a group of beautiful columns, the ruins 
of a temple to Poseidon, of particular interest at that time, as active 
reconstruction was in progress. Gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins, 
and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet 
in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to 
match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original. Later they 
would be hoisted into place.   There is a mediocre restaurant at 
Sounion and I fed a thin little Grecian cat and gave it two saucers 
of water- there was no milk- which it lapped up as though it were 
nectar. I think its thirst had never been assuaged before.   Norton 
and I dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in Piraeus right 
on the water's edge. To enter it, you go down five or six steps 
from the road. Across the road is the kitchen, and waiters bearing great 
trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their French colleagues 
at the restaurant in the Place du Tertre in Paris.   This restaurant, 
too, had a cat, a dusty, thin little creature. How <can> 
a cat be thin in a fish restaurant? But this one was. When offered 
a morsel it glanced right and left and winced, obviously frightened 
and expecting a kick, but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit. Greece 
was one of the highlights of our trip, but beginning in Greece and continuing 
around the world throughout Southeast Asia the treatment of 
animals was horrifying, ranging from callous indifference to active 
cruelty. This of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated 
people we met, who loved their pets, but kindness is not a basic human 
instinct.   We met some charming Athenians, and among them our 
chauffeur Panyotis ranked high. His English was limited, and the 
little he knew he found irritating. A particularly galling phrase was 
"O&K&, Panyotis, we have time at our disposal". This he 
claimed was the favorite refrain of the English. They would be lolling 
under a tree sipping Ouzo, relishing the leisurely life, assuring 
him that the day was yet young. 
"Let him become honest, and they discard him.- But let him be ready 
to invent whatever falsehood- to assail whatever character- and 
to prostitute his paper to whatever ends- and they hug him to their 
heart. In proportion to the degradation of his moral worth, is the 
increase of his worth to them".   To exonerate the legislature 
and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation, Pike took another 
course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked. He 
claimed in his attacks that Woodruff, with scurrilous underhandedness, 
had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the 
honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract 
without knowing what they were doing.   The charge was so farfetched 
that Woodruff paid little attention to it, and answered Pike 
in a rather bored way, wearily declaring that a "new hand" was 
pumping the bellows of the Crittenden organ, and concluding: "In 
a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles, 
even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels. The game 
is not worth the ammunition it would cost. We therefore leave the writer 
to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse 
he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd 
to which he belongs".   Despite Woodruff's continuing refusal 
to debate with Pike through the columns of his newspaper, Pike 
did not let up his attack for a moment. Over the months he became a 
political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing 
Woodruff, the "Casca" letters belittling Woodruff, and long 
analytical articles vilifying Woodruff. So persistent were these attacks 
that in March of the following year, Woodruff was finally moved 
to action, and Pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics, 
the subtle art of diversion.   To attack Pike directly would 
gain Woodruff little, for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing 
to lose. By this time Woodruff had accurately measured Pike as a 
man of great personal pride, a man who would fly into a towering rage 
if his integrity were questioned, and who would be anxious to avenge himself. 
Pike's honor would now come under attack, but not by Woodruff 
himself. The charges would be made in the <Gazette> by an anonymous 
correspondent, and Pike would be so busy trying to track down the 
illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing Woodruff. 
The strategy worked perfectly.   Pike was stunned by the 
first blast against his character, which was published in the March 
4th issue of the <Gazette> under the name "Vale". The anonymous 
correspondent did not resort to innuendoes. He called Pike a thief. 
He said Pike had stolen mules from Harris during the Santa Fe 
expedition; he accused Pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career 
in Arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in Van Buren. The 
charges caught Pike off balance, coming as they did from an unexpected 
quarter. Outraged, he used the <Advocate> of March 7th for a 
denial, sending immediately to Santa Fe and Van Buren for documents 
to vindicate himself, and demanding that Woodruff reveal the name 
of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym.

Woodruff said nothing, and Pike, frustrated, stormed 
throughout Little Rock in an unsuccessful search for "Vale", 
asking 
his friends to keep their ears open. Finally he learned through 
the grapevine that the culprit might be one James W& Robinson in 
Pope County. Without further inquiry, Pike jumped to the conclusion 
that Robinson was guilty, and, following the honorable route that 
would 
eventually lead to the dueling ground, sent a message to Robinson 
through his friends, demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity. 
Robinson did neither. To Pike, silence was tantamount to an 
admission of guilt, and he determined to get Robinson onto the dueling 
ground at all costs. On April 11th he wrote an open letter in the 
<Advocate>, making it known "to the world that Jas& W& Robinson 
<is by his own admission> a base LIAR and a SLANDERER".

If Robinson was a liar and a slanderer, he was also 
a very canny gentleman, for nothing that Pike could do would pry so 
much as a single word out of him. Preoccupied with his own defense and 
his attempts to get Robinson to fight, Pike lessened his attacks 
on Woodruff, and finally stopped them altogether. And Pike never did 
find out if Robinson was really responsible for the "Vale" letter. 
Woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful.   It 
took Pike a long time to realize what Woodruff had done, and it had 
a profound effect on him. Once he learned a lesson, he never forgot it. 
In the next few months of comparative silence, Pike waited patiently 
until conditions were perfect for a new attack, and then, displaying 
a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting, gained 
from his first bout with Woodruff, he used these changed conditions 
to excellent advantage.   Shortly after the "Vale" incident, 
a rift began to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope. 
One-armed, gruff, frugally honest, Governor Pope had been the 
ideal man to assume office in Arkansas after the disgraceful antics of 
political bosses like Crittenden, and he ruled the state with an iron 
fist, tolerating no nonsense. Woodruff had supported him all the way, 
both as a chief executive and as a man. Besides being political allies, 
they were also friends. This warm relationship came to an abrupt 
end in June of 1834 when the National Congress appropriated $3,000 
for compiling and printing the laws of Arkansas Territory, and, 
taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature, left 
it to the governor to award the contract.   Woodruff wanted this 
political windfall very badly, and everyone assumed that he would get 
it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter. 
After all, Woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was 
the logical man for the job. But because the governor was determined 
that friendship should not influence him one way or the other, he looked 
for a printer with a knowledge of the law (which Woodruff did not 
have), and awarded the contract to a lawyer named John Steele who 
had started a newspaper in Helena the year before.   Woodruff was 
furious. Considering the governor's act a personal rebuff, he aired 
his feelings in the <Gazette> on August 26, 1834: "We think 
the governor treated us rather shabbily, to say the least of it. **h 
It is but justice to Mr& Steele for us to add that, in the above 
remarks, nothing is intended to his disparagement, either as a lawyer 
or as a printer. He got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his 
good luck. We hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle 
him to credit".   As summer cooled into fall and winter, 
even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder 
by the day, and by December of 1834 it was icy. It was at this point 
that Pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two 
men. The eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract 
that Woodruff still held.   From his first bout with the 
canny Woodruff, Pike had learned that it was better not to attack him 
directly, so, harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too 
high, he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs 
to exist. To document his charge, Pike set up two parallel columns 
in the <Advocate> showing the price charged by the <Gazette> and 
the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere. 
Then he called on the governor to explain why.   The governor 
was not used to having his integrity questioned, and he promptly 
passed the charges on to Woodruff, demanding that Woodruff answer them. 
If Woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation, the governor 
insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in 
the <Advocate>. Woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma. 
As a proud man, his prestige would suffer if he let Pike dictate 
to him through the governor's office, but to lower his prices would 
be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first 
place. As a consequence, he did neither. Very angry at Woodruff, 
the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract 
withdrawn from the <Gazette> and awarded to the lowest bidder, which, 
by a strange coincidence, happened to be Pike's <Advocate>. 
And, for the moment at least, the governor now found himself allied with 
the head of the Crittenden faction he had formerly opposed, and Pike 
was credited with a clear triumph over Woodruff.   But in 
the 
confused atmosphere of frontier politics, alliances were as quickly 
broken as they were formed, and as Pike came to favor with the governor 
of the Territory, the governor fell out of favor with the President 
of the United States. On January 28, 1835, Andrew Jackson removed 
Pope from office and elevated Territorial Secretary William 
S& Fulton to the position. Fulton was a very close friend of Jackson, 
and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the 
old days. As a stanch party man and a rabid Democrat, he had little 
tolerance for Whigs like Pike, and Pike lost any immediate personal 
advantage his victory over Woodruff might have gained him.

As Pike proved himself adept in the political arena, he also became 
a social lion in the village of Little Rock, where he served as a symbol 
of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly 
to cultivate. After all, Pike was an established poet and his work 
had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of 
American culture, Boston. His accomplishments, and the fact that he 
was resident, did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to 
describe Little Rock after a visit there. For some reason, none of 
them were impressed with the territorial capital. The internationally 
known sportsman and traveler Friedrich Gersta^cker was typical of 
its detractors in the mid-thirties. "Little Rock is a vile, detestable 
place **h". he wrote. "Little Rock is, without any flattery, 
one of the dullest towns in the United States and I would not have 
remained two hours in the place, if I had not met with some good friends 
who made me forget its dreariness".   Pike enjoyed his 
new social position tremendously, and cultivated in himself those traits 
necessary to its preservation. He was especially popular with women, 
for, like the romantic poetry he wrote, he was personally gracious, 
gallant, and chivalrous. He again began to play the violin, and tucking 
the instrument beneath his chin, performed soulful and romantic airs 
to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered 
to hear him. His artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into 
any social gathering. He composed songs and set them to music and 
sang them in a soft, melodious voice, and when his audience had had enough 
of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western 
adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike.

The bulk of his early reputation, however, came not from 
his poetry or his music, but from his excellence as an orator. By 1834 
the art of oratory had reached a very high level in the United States 
as a literary form. The orator of this period, in order to earn a 
reputation, had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his 
speech, judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect 
it would have on the audience that heard it.   Very soon after his 
arrival in Little Rock, Pike had joined one of the most influential 
organizations in town, the Little Rock Debating Society, and it 
was with this group that he made his debut as an orator, being invited 
to deliver the annual Fourth of July address the club sponsored every 
year. 
SAMUEL GORTON, founder of Warwick, was styled by the historian 
Samuel Greene Arnold "one of the most remarkable men who ever lived". 
A biographer called him "the premature John the Baptist of 
New England Transcendentalism". The historian Charles Francis 
Adams called him "a crude and half-crazy thinker". His contemporaries 
in Massachusetts called him an arch-heretic, a beast, a miscreant, 
a proud and pestilent seducer, a prodigious minter of exorbitant 
novelties. Edward Rawson, secretary of the colony of Massachusetts 
Bay, described him as "a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies 
and insolence, a corrupter of the truth, a disturber of the peace 
wherever he comes". Nathaniel Morton stated he "was deeply leavened 
with blasphemous and familistical opinions". He was thrown 
out, more or less, from Boston, Plymouth, Pocasset, Newport, and Providence.

On the other hand, Dr& Ezra Styles recorded the 
following testimony of John Angell, the last disciple of Gorton: 
"  He said Gorton was a holy man; wept day and night for 
the sins and blindness of the world **h had a long walk through the trees 
and woods by his house, where he constantly walked morning and evening, 
and even in the depths of the night, alone by himself, for contemplation 
and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light. He was universally 
beloved by his neighbours, and the Indians, who esteemed him, 
not only as a friend, but one high in communion with God in Heaven". 
Gorton sometimes signed himself "a professor of the mysteries of 
Christ".   There is plenty more to recommend Gorton, the facts 
of whose life are given in <The Life and Times of Samuel Gorton,> 
by Adelos Gorton. He fought like a fiend for the helpless and 
oppressed, worked for the abolition of slavery, helped the Quakers 
and Indians, and worked against the prosecution of witches. He defied 
the Boston hierarchy, and after they sent a small army to get him 
he befuddled the court, including John Cotton, with one of the most 
complicated religious discourses ever heard.   Samuel Gorton was 
born at Gorton, England, near the present city of Manchester, about 
1592. Although he did not attend any celebrated schools or universities, 
he was a master of Greek and Hebrew and could read the Bible 
in the original. He worked as a "clothier" in London, but was greatly 
concerned with religion.   Gorton left England, he said, 
"to enjoy libertie of conscience in respect to faith towards God, 
and for no other end". With his wife and three or more children he 
arrived in Boston in March, 1637, and soon found it was no place for 
anyone looking for liberty of conscience. Roger Williams had recently 
been thrown out, and Anne Hutchinson and her Antinomians were slugging 
it out with the powers-that-be. Gorton and his family moved to 
Plymouth.   Soon he was in trouble there, for defending a woman 
who was accused of smiling in church. She was Ellen Aldridge, a widow 
of good repute who was employed by Gorton's wife and lived with 
the family. The report was: "  It had been whispered privately 
that she had smiled in the congregation, and the Governor Prence 
sent to knoe her business, and command, after punishment as the bench 
see fit, her departure and also anyone who brought her "to the place 
from which she came"". Gorton said they were preparing to deport 
her as a vagabond, and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for 
several days, returning at night. He advised the poor woman not to 
appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of 
law. Gorton appeared for her, however, and what he told the magistrates 
must have been plenty, for he was charged with deluding the court, 
fined, and told to leave the colony within fourteen days. He left in 
a storm for Pocasset, December 4, 1638. His wife was in delicate health 
and nursing an infant with measles.   The unconquerable Mrs& 
Hutchinson was residing at Pocasset, after having been excommunicated 
by the Boston church and thrown out of the colony. One can imagine 
that with her and Gorton there it was no place for anyone with 
weak nerves. William Coddington, who was running the colony, felt constrained 
to move seven miles south where, with others- as mentioned 
above- he founded Newport. When, in March, 1640, the two towns 
were united under Coddington, Gorton claimed the union was irregular 
and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the 
majority of freeholders.   Then he became involved in a ruckus 
remarkably similar to the one in Plymouth. A cow owned by an old woman 
trespassed on Gorton's land. While driving the cow back home the 
woman was assaulted by a servant maid of Gorton. The old woman complained 
to the deputy governor, who ordered the servant brought before 
the court. Gorton reverted to his Plymouth tactics, refused to let 
her go, and appeared himself before the Portsmouth grand jury. During 
the trial he told off the jury, called them "Just Asses" and 
called a freeman "a saucy boy and Jack-an-Apes". He was jailed 
and banished.   Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the 
town in a turmoil. He held that no group of colonists could set up 
or maintain a government without royal sanction. Since Rhode Island 
at that time did not have such sanction, his opinion was not popular. 
Roger Williams wrote his friend Winthrop as follows: "  Master 
Gorton, having foully abused high and low at Aquidneck is now 
bewitching and bemaddening poor Providence, both with his unclean and 
foul censures of all the ministers of this country (for which myself 
have in Christ's name withstood him), and also denying all visible 
and external ordinances in depth of Familism: almost all suck in 
his poison, as at first they did at Aquidneck. Some few and myself withstand 
his inhabitation and town privileges, without confession and 
reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at Portsmouth; yet 
the tide is too strong against us, and I fear (if the framer of hearts 
help not) it will force me to little Patience, a little isle next 
to your Prudence". Williams also stated: "Our peace was like 
the peace of a man who hath the tertian ague".   Providence finally 
managed to get Gorton out of the town, and he and some friends 
bought land at Pawtuxet on the west side of Narragansett Bay, five 
miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the Providence colony. 
This town should not be confused with Pawtucket, just north of Providence, 
or Pawcatuck, Connecticut, on the Pawcatuck River, opposite 
Westerly, Rhode Island.   Up to now, Gorton had been looking 
for trouble, and now that he was trying to get away from it, trouble 
started looking for him. Upon intelligence that the formidable 
agitator was to favor them with his presence, the benighted inhabitants 
of Pawtuxet, alas, gave their allegiance to Massachusetts and asked 
that colony to expel the newcomers. As it was the custom of that alert 
colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection, 
this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack 
of wolves and saying "Come and get it".   Gorton and company, 
however, promptly bought land from Miantonomi a few miles south 
of Pawtuxet, extending from the present Gaspee Point south to Warwick 
Neck and twenty miles inland. The settlement was called Shawomet. 
It was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything, including 
Providence and Massachusetts. If Gorton wanted peace and quiet 
for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it. Instead 
of that he was engulfed by bedlam.   Pomham and Soconoco, 
a couple of minor sachems (of something less than exalted character) 
under Miantonomi, declared that they had never assented to the sale 
of land to Gorton and had never received anything for it. Following 
the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet, they also submitted themselves 
to the protection of Massachusetts. One historical authority 
presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion 
that Massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled 
Gorton.   However, the General Court at Boston ordered 
the purchasers of Shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems' 
claim. The purchasers rejected the order in two letters written 
in vigorous terms. Then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics. 
It pointed out twenty-six instances of blasphemy in the letters, 
and ordered the writers to submit or force of arms would be used. The 
next week, forty soldiers were sent to get the miscreants. The latter 
tried to arbitrate through a delegation from Providence, which offer 
was declined by the invaders. The Commissioners at Boston wrote 
the victims to see their misdeeds and repent or they should "look upon 
them as men prepared for slaughter".   At Shawomet, women 
and children fled in terror across the Bay. The men fortified a blockhouse 
and got ready to fight, but meanwhile appealed to the King and 
again tried to arbitrate. Gorton evidently still had plenty to learn 
about Massachusetts, but he was learning fast. Governor Winthrop wrote: 
"  You may do well to take notice, that besides the title 
to land between the English and the Indians there, there are twelve 
of the English that have subscribed their names to horrible and detestable 
blasphemies, who are rather to be judged as blasphemous than 
they should delude us by winning time under pretence of arbitration".

The attack started on October 2, 1643, and the Gortonists held 
out for a day and a night. The attackers sent for more soldiers, and 
the defenders, to save bloodshed, surrendered under the promise that 
they would be treated as neighbors. Promptly their livestock was taken 
and according to Gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock down anyone 
who should utter a word of insolence, and run through anyone who 
might step out of line.   When the captives arrived in Boston, 
"the chaplain [of their captors] went to prayers in the open streets, 
that the people might take notice what they had done in a holy manner, 
and in the name of the Lord". Gorton and ten of his friends 
were thrown in jail.   On Sunday they refused to attend church. 
The magistrates were determined to compel them. The prisoners agreed, 
provided they might speak after the sermon, which was permitted. Here 
was Gorton's chance to indulge in something at which he was supreme. 
The Boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with 
torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities, but Gorton was better. Reverend 
Cotton preached to them about Demetrius and the shrines of Ephesus. 
Gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation.

At the trial which took place later, the Pomham matter was completely 
omitted. The Gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried 
for their lives. Four ecclesiastical questions were presented by the 
General Court to Gorton: "_1._ Whether the Fathers, who 
died before Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, were justified and 
saved only by the blood which hee shed, and the death which hee suffered 
after his incarnation? _2._ Whether the only price of our 
redemption were not the death of Christ on the cross, with the rest 
of his sufferings and obediences, in the time of his life here, after 
hee was born of the Virgin Mary? _3._ Who was the God whom hee 
thinke we serve? _4._ What hee means when hee saith, wee worship 
the starre of our God Remphan, Chion, Moloch"?   Gorton 
answered in writing. All of the elders except three voted for death, 
but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence. 
Seven of the prisoners were sentenced to be confined in irons for as 
long as it pleased the court, set to work and, if they broke jail or proclaimed 
heresy, to be executed if convicted. The three others got off 
easier. The convicts were put in chains, paraded before the congregation 
at the Reverend Cotton's lecture as an example, and sent to 
prisons in various towns, where they languished all winter, chains included. 
When Fred wheeled him back into his room, the big one looking out on 
the back porch, and put him to bed, Papa told him he was very tired 
but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown. "I've been cooped 
up so long", he added. Getting out again, seeing old friends, 
had given his spirits a lift.   That night after supper I went 
back over to 48 Spruce Street- Ralph and I at that time were living 
at 168 Chestnut- and Ralph went with me. Papa was still elated 
over his afternoon visit downtown. "Baby, I saw a lot of old friends 
I hadn't seen in a long time", he told me, his eyes bright. 
"It was mighty good for the old man to get out again".   The 
next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent 
spirits. But a few days after Fred's return he began hemorrhaging 
and that was the beginning of early and complete disintegration. It 
began in the morning, and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one. 
We got Dr& Glenn to him as quickly as we could, and we wired 
Tom of Papa's desperate condition. The hemorrhage was in the prostate 
region; Dr& Glenn saw at once what had happened.   "He 
has lost much blood", he said. "It'll take a lot to replace 
it".   "Dr& Glenn, I've got a lot of blood", Fred 
spoke up, "plenty of it. Let me give Papa blood".   The doctor 
agreed, but explained that it would be necessary first to check Fred's 
blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as 
Papa's. To give a patient the wrong type of blood, said the doctor, 
would likely kill him.   That was in the days before blood banks, 
of course, and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to 
patient. One had to find a donor, and usually very quickly, whose blood 
corresponded with the patient's. And then it took considerably 
longer to make preparations for giving transfusions. They had to take 
blood samples to the laboratory to test them, for one thing, and there 
was much required preliminary procedure.   They made the tests 
and came to Fred; by now it was perhaps two days or longer after Papa 
had begun hemorrhaging.   "Fred, your blood matches your 
father's, all right", Dr& Glenn said. "But we aren't going 
to let you give him any".   "But why in the name of God can't 
I give my father blood"? Fred demanded. "Why can't I, 
Doctor"?   "Because, Fred, it could do him no good. It's 
too late now. He's past helping. He's as good as gone".

And in a few minutes Papa was dead. It was well past midnight. 
Papa had left us about the same hour of the night that Ben had passed 
on. The date was June 20, 1922.   "W& O& Wolfe, 
prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section, died shortly 
after midnight Tuesday at his home 48 Spruce Street", the Asheville 
<Times> of Wednesday, June 21, announced. "Mr& Wolfe 
had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected". 
A biographical sketch followed.   Funeral services were 
held Thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home. Beloved Dr& 
R& F& Campbell, our First Presbyterian Church pastor, was 
in charge. The burial was out in Riverside Cemetery. All about him 
stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned.

A few years before his death Papa had agreed with Mama to make a 
joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of 
the 
death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children 
whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash. At his death 
Fred and Ralph, my husband, were named executors of the estate under 
the terms of the will.   Fred and Ralph qualified as executors 
and paid off what debts were currently due, and they were all current, 
since Papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid. The bills 
were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the 
last years of his life, and when he died he owed in the main only current 
doctor's bills. After they had paid all his debts and the funeral 
costs, Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars, as I remember, 
with which to pay the bequests. This, manifestly, would not 
provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children.   So what 
Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking 
into account what each of the five had received, if anything, from 
the estate before Papa's death. Consequently, Fred and Tom, the 
two who had been provided college educations, signed statements to the 
effect that each had received his bequest in full, and Effie and I 
were each allotted $5000. Frank had been given about half his legacy 
to use in a business venture before Papa's death; he was given the 
difference between that amount and $5000. Tom had received four years 
of education at the University of North Carolina and two at Harvard, 
and Fred had been in and out of Georgia Tech and Carneigie 
Tech and part of the time had been a self-help student. So, because 
he had received less than Tom, it was felt proper that Fred should receive 
the few hundred dollars that remained. And that's how Papa's 
estate was divided.   Papa, I should emphasize, had been an 
invalid the last several years of his life; his hospital and doctor 
bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving 
little except 
small rentals on some properties he still owned. Had 
he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism, I'm convinced, 
Papa would have left a sizable estate. But he had succeeded well, 
we agreed. 
He had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands 
and stocks and bonds.   For years Papa and Mama had been large 
taxpayers. I recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800. 
In those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates, that 
payment represented ownership of much property.   "Merciful God, 
Julia"! I have known Papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill, 
"we're going to the dogs"!   But he never expected to 
do that. And he didn't, by a long shot! 

#35.#

In the spring 
of his second year at Harvard, Tom had been offered a job at Northwestern 
University as an instructor in the English Department. But 
he had delayed accepting this job, and as he was leaving to come home 
to Papa in response to our telegram, he dropped a postcard to Miss 
McCrady, head of the Harvard Appointment Office, asking her please 
to write Northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances.

Actually Tom had been postponing giving them an answer, I'm 
confident, because he did not want to go out there to teach. In fact, 
he didn't want to teach anywhere. He wanted to go back to Harvard 
for another year of playwriting. But Papa's death had further complicated 
the financing of Tom's hoped-for third year, and for the 
weeks following it Tom did not know whether his return to Harvard could 
be arranged.   But things were worked out in the family and 
late in August he wrote Miss McCrady an explanatory letter in which 
he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition 
after Papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home 
with Mama, accept the Northwestern job, or return to Harvard. But 
he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition 
that he could go back to Harvard for a third year with Professor 
Baker.   And that's what he did. That third year he wrote plays 
with a fury. I believe there are seventeen short plays by Tom now 
housed in the Houghton Library at Harvard; I think I'm right 
in that figure. That fall he submitted to Professor Baker the first 
acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays, six of them, 
according to some of his associates, and he also worked on a play 
that he first called <Niggertown>, the material for which he had collected 
during the summer at home. Later this play would be called <Welcome 
to Our City>. In the spring, it must have been, he began 
working on the play that he called <The House>, which later would 
be <Mannerhouse>. That spring <Welcome to Our City> was selected 
for production by the 47 Workshop and it was staged in the middle 
of May. It ran two nights, and though it was generally praised, there 
was considerable criticism of its length. It ran until past one o'clock. 
That was Tom's weakness; it was demonstrated, many critics 
would later point out, in the length of his novels. In this play 
there were so many characters and so much detail. Tom never knew how 
to condense, to boil down. He was always concerned with life, and he 
tried to picture it whole; he wanted nothing compressed, tight. He 
was a big man, and he wanted nothing little, squeezed; he despised parsimony, 
and particularly of words. In this play there were some thirty 
or more named characters and I don't know how many more unnamed. 
In describing it to Professor Baker after it had been chosen for 
production, he defended his great array of characters by declaring that 
he had included that many not because "I didn't know how to save 
paint", but because the play required them. And he threatened someday 
to write a play "with fifty, eighty, a hundred people- a whole 
town, a whole race, a whole epoch". He said he would do it, though 
probably nobody would produce it, for his own "soul's ease and 
comfort".   That summer Tom attended the summer session at Harvard, 
but he did not ask Mama to send him back in the fall. Instead, 
he went down to New York and submitted <Welcome to Our City> 
to the Theatre Guild, which had asked him to let them have a look at 
it after Professor Baker had recommended it highly. He hung around 
New York, waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production 
and in that time came down to Asheville and also paid a short visit 
to Chapel Hill, where with almost childish delight he visited old 
friends and favorite campus spots. On returning to New York he had 
a job for several weeks; it was visiting University of North Carolina 
alumni in New York to ask them for contributions to the Graham 
Memorial Building fund. The Graham Memorial would be the campus 
student union honoring the late and much beloved Edward Kidder Graham, 
who had been president when Tom entered the university.   Well, 
the Theatre Guild kept that play, and kept it, and finally in 
December they turned it down. But they would reconsider it, they assured 
him, if he would rewrite it. Tom told me about it, how one evening 
he went over to see the Theatre Guild man. This man, Tom said, 
had the play shut up in his desk, I believe, and when Tom sat down, 
he pulled it out and apologetically told Tom that they wouldn't be 
able to use it.   Tom said he almost burst into tears, he was so 
disappointed and put out. The man, Tom said, explained that it was 
not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort 
of thing the public wanted. The public, Tom said the man told him, 
wanted realism, and his play wasn't that. It was fantastic writing, 
beautiful writing, the man declared, but the public, he insisted, 
wanted realism.   Tom was not willing to revise the play according 
to the plan the man suggested. Such a revision, he said, would ruin 
it, would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment. 
He thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do 
it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made. 
##

It was not until we had returned to the city to live, while I 
was still at Brown and Sharpe's, that I felt the full impact of 
evangelical Christianity. I came under the spell of a younger group 
in the church led by the pastor's older son. The spirit of this group 
was that we were- and are- living in a world doomed to eternal 
punishment, but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of 
escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation. 
There are millions who accept this doctrine, but few indeed are those 
who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on 
their souls night and day. This group in Park Place Church was made 
up of the earnest few. I was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns 
and responsibilities. I engaged more and more in religious activities. 
Besides Church and Sunday School I went to out-of-door meetings 
on the sidewalk at the church door. I went to an afternoon service 
at the ~YMCA. I went to the Christian Endeavor Society 
and to the evening service of the church. Much of this lacked the active 
support of the pastor. The young people were self-energizing, and 
I was energized. Once or twice my father asked me if I wasn't overdoing 
a bit in my churchgoing.   Meanwhile I myself was not yet 
saved. At least I had been unable to lay hold on the experience of 
conversion. Try as I might to confess my sins and accept salvation, 
no answer came to me from heaven. Finally, after years, I gave up.

The basic difficulty, I suppose, was in my ultimate inability 
to feel a burden of sin from which I sought relief. I was familiar 
with <Pilgrim's Progress>, which I read as literature. No load 
of sin had been laid on my shoulders, nor did earnest effort enable 
me to become conscious of one.   There is, of course, the doctrine 
of original sin, which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes 
of the guilt of our first ancestor. In the rhyming catechism this 
doctrine is worded thus: "In Adam's fall We sin-ned all".

This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense. I did not feel 
it presumptuous to expect that the Creator would be at least as just 
as the most righteous of His creatures; and the doctrine of original 
sin is compounded of injustice.   Some of these thoughts- not 
all of them- have taken organized form in later years. The actual 
impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another 
sort. I became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of 
my own miserable soul. I found myself becoming one of that group of 
people who, in Carlyle's words, "are forever gazing into their own 
navels, anxiously asking 'Am I right, am I wrong'"? I bethought 
me of the Lord's Prayer, and these words came to mind: 
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven". 
They have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years 
which since have passed. From that time to this my religious concern 
is that I might give effective help to the bringing in of God's kingdom 
on earth.   I do not claim to be free from sin, or from the 
need for repentance and forgiveness. In my experience the assurance 
of forgiveness comes only when I have confessed to the wronged one and 
have made as full reparation as I can devise. ##

There was one 
further step in my religious progress. This was taken after I came 
to live in Springfield, and it was made under the guidance of the Reverend 
Raymond Beardslee, a young preacher who came to the Congregational 
Church there at about the same time that I moved from New York. 
His father was a professor at Hartford Theological Seminary, 
and from him he acquired a conviction, which he passed along to me, that 
there is in the universe of persons a moral law, the law of love, 
which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law.

It is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable 
in all personal relationships, whether individually, socially 
or as between whole nations of people. If obeyed, the law brings order 
and satisfaction. If disobeyed, the result is turmoil and chaos.

As we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable. 
We can conceive of no alternatives. Their basis seems deeper 
than mere authority. They are not true because scientists or prophets 
say they are true. It is not the authority of God Himself which 
makes them true. Because God is what He is, the laws of the universe, 
material and spiritual, are what they are. Deity and Law are one 
and inseparable.   With this conviction, the partition between 
the sacred and the secular disappears. One's daily work becomes sacred, 
since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law, 
dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy.

In his book <Civilization and Ethics> Albert Schweitzer faces 
the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business 
life, for example. His <Ethics> defines "possessions as the 
property of the community, of which the individual is sovereign steward. 
One serves society by conducting a business from which a certain 
number of employees draw their means of subsistence; another by giving 
away his property in order to help his fellow man. Each will decide 
on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according 
to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular 
circumstances of his own life. No one is to judge others".

He is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds 
it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for 
the sake of a larger good. For this decision a man must take personal 
responsibility. Says he, "I may never imagine that in the struggle 
between personal and supra-personal responsibility it is possible 
to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape 
of a relative ethic; or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive. 
On the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between 
the two".   Schweitzer seems, in fact, to acquire for himself 
a burden of sin, not bequeathed by Adam, but accumulated in the 
inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and 
lesser responsibilities. This viewpoint I find interesting, but it 
has never weighed on my soul. Perhaps it should have. My own experience 
has followed simpler lines.   An uncompromising belief in the 
moral law has the advantage of making religion natural, even as physical 
law is natural. Neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels 
any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy, 
nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience. To 
obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense, applied to a neglected 
field. Religion thus becomes integrated with life.   This 
truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries. One 
of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life. In seeking 
for such meaning and purpose, Albert Schweitzer seized upon the concept 
of the "sacredness of life". It is puzzling to the occidental 
mind (to mine at least) to assign "sacredness" to animal, insect, 
and plant life. These lives are in themselves outside of the moral order 
and are unburdened with moral responsibility. There is indeed a 
moral responsibility on man himself, for his own soul's sake, to respect 
lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering, but this viewpoint 
Schweitzer rejects.   So far as "sacredness" inheres 
in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality, 
whether in Lambarene, Africa, or in Washington, D&C&. One 
cannot read the records of scientists, officials and travelers who 
have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing 
that each individual met with is a <person>. Read, for instance, 
in 
Malcolm MacDonald's <Borneo People> of Segura and her wise 
father Tomonggong Koh, and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization. 
Above all read in Jens Bjerre's <The Last Cannibals> 
how the old man of the Wailbri tribe (not cannibals) in central Australia 
gave to the white man his choicest possession, while the tears 
streamed down his face. The Australian aborigine is the conventional 
exemplar of degraded humanity; yet here was a depth of sensibility 
which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our 
civilization.   Persons, whether white, black, brown or yellow, 
are a concern of God. Respect for personality is a privilege and a 
duty for us as brothers.   Such is the field for exercising our 
reverence. As to our action, let us align ourselves with the purpose 
expressed by Jesus in the Lord's Prayer: "Thy kingdom come, 
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven". With the knowledge 
that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations 
with all people, we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means 
and the ends of our lives.   This intellectual approach to spiritual 
life suited me well, because I was never content to lead a divided 
life. As I have said, words from Tennyson remain ever in my memory: 
"That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as 
before".   Let us now give some thought to the soul. When the 
young biologist, Dr& Ballard, began to show interest in our daughter 
Elizabeth, this induced a corresponding interest, on our part, in 
him. I asked one day what he was doing. He told me that he had a big 
newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the 
big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto 
the big newt. He was then noting that the big eye on the little newt 
hung back until the little eye had grown up to it, while the little 
eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other. Then 
I asked, "What does that teach you"? Said he, "It teaches 
me to wonder".   This was a profound statement. In the face 
of the unfolding universe, our ultimate attitude is that of wonder. 
Wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world.

Gone are the days when, in the nineteenth century, scientists thought 
that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of 
the physical universe. For them only a little more needed to be learned, 
and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted, packaged 
and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human 
problem.   This complacency was blown to bits by the relativity 
of Einstein, the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the 
discovery of the expanding universe. None of these discoveries were 
neatly rounded off bits of knowledge. Each faded out into the unexplored 
areas of the future.   It is as if we, in our center of human 
observation, from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown. 
As our radius of penetration, ~R, increases, the area of new 
knowledge 
increases by **f, and the total of human knowledge becomes measured 
in terms of **f. Wonder grows. It is endless.   There are 
some people, intelligent people, who seem to be untouched by the sea 
of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives. One 
such is Abraham Meyer, the writer of a recent book, <Speaking of 
Man>. This is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and 
a vigorous defense of pure materialism. His inability to wonder vitiates 
his argument.   The subject of immortality brings to mind a 
vivid incident which took place in 1929 at Montreux in Switzerland.

Criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for 
our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past 
have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature. I have chosen five 
contrasting pairs, ten men in all, and they are arranged in roughly 
chronological order. Such a list must naturally be selective, and the 
treatment of each man is brief, for I am interested only in their general 
ideas on the moral measure of literature. Altogether, the list 
will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones, 
for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider 
art above ethics, all the way from Plato to Poe. And most of the 
great periods are represented, because we will compare Plato and Aristotle 
from the golden age of Greece; Stephen Gosson and Sir Philip 
Sidney from renaissance England; Dr& Johnson and William 
Hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England; 
and James Russell Lowell and Edgar Allan Poe of nineteenth 
century American letters. 

#PLATO AND ARISTOTLE#

Plato and Aristotle 
agree on some vital literary issues. They both measure literature 
by moral standards, and in their political writings both allow for 
censorship, but the differences between them are also significant. While 
Aristotle censors literature only for the young, Plato would banish 
all poets from his ideal state. Even more important, in his <Poetics,> 
Aristotle differs somewhat from Plato when he moves in the 
direction of treating literature as a unique thing, separate and apart 
from its causes and its effects.   All through <The Republic,> 
Plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately 
to a good life for his citizens. In short, he is constantly concerned 
with the ethical effects. When he discusses the subject matter 
of poetry, he asks what moral effect the scenes will have. When he 
turns briefly to literary style, in the Third Book, he again looks to 
the effect on the audience. He explains that his citizens must not 
be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that 
one finds in much poetry, and he observes that all "these pantomimic 
gentlemen" will be sent to another state. Only those story tellers 
will remain who can "imitate the style of the virtuous".

Plato is, at times, just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he 
is of their work. When he discusses tyrants in the Eighth Book of 
<The Republic,> he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst 
rulers. But the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears 
in the Tenth Book, and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms. 
In Plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the 
poet and the philosopher, because the poet imitates only particular objects 
and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction, much 
less the highest level of ideal forms. True reality, of course, is 
the ideal, and the poet knows nothing of this; only the philosopher 
knows the truth.   Poets, moreover, dwell on human passions. And 
with this point about the passions, we encounter Plato's dualism. 
The same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both Babbitt and 
More, that we must examine it in some detail. Plato feels that man 
has two competing aspects, his rational faculty and his irrational. 
We can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures, the passions 
in this case, and strengthen our rational side; and poetry, with all 
its emphasis on the passions, encourages the audience to give way to 
emotion. For this reason, then, poetry tends to weaken the power of 
control, the reason, because it tempts one to indulge his passions, and 
even the best of men, he maintains, may be corrupted by this subtle 
influence.   Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something 
of an enigma, because he is so completely sensitive to its charm. 
His whole objection, indeed, seems to rise out of a deep conviction 
that the poets <do> have great power to influence, but Plato seldom 
pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself. He is, 
rather, concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets 
to join his fight for justice. He wants them to use their great power 
to strengthen man's rational side, to teach virtue, and to encourage 
religion.   While Plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns 
to the gods and famous men, still he clearly leaves the way open for 
further discussion of the issue. He even calls upon the poets to defend 
the Muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue. He says: 
"  We 
may further grant to those of her [Poetry's] defenders 
who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets, the permission to 
speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant 
but also useful to States and to human life, and we will listen 
in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall surely be the 
gainers- I mean, if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight".

When we turn to Aristotle's ideas on the moral measure 
of literature, it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned 
about the influence of the art. In the ideal state, for instance, 
he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully 
selected tales and stories. For this reason, he would banish indecent 
pictures and speeches from the stage; and the young people should 
not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to 
drink strong wine and sit at the public tables. By the time they reach 
that age, however, Aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence 
of comedies.   In Aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the 
<Poetics,> we find an attempt to isolate the art, to consider only 
those things proper to it, to discover how it differs from other arts, 
and to deal with the effects peculiar to it. He assures us, early 
in the <Poetics,> that all art is "imitation" and that all imitation 
gives pleasure, but he distinguishes between art in general and 
poetic art on the basis of the means, manner, and the objects of the 
imitation. Once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms, 
he lays down his famous definition of tragedy, which sets up standards 
and so lends direction to the remainder of the work. A tragedy, by 
his definition, is an imitation of an action that is serious, of a certain 
magnitude, and complete in itself. It should have a dramatic form 
with pleasing language, and it should portray incidents which so arouse 
pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience. Any 
tragedy, he maintains, has six elements: plot, character, and thought 
(the objects of imitation), diction and melody (the means of imitation), 
and spectacle (the manner of imitation). Throughout the rest of 
the <Poetics,> Aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics 
of these six 
parts and their interrelationship, and he refers frequently to the 
standards suggested by his definition of tragedy.   Aristotle's 
method in the <Poetics,> then, does suggest that we should isolate 
the work. The Chicago contingent of modern critics follow Aristotle 
so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare 
one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation. But there are, 
however, several features of Aristotle's approach which open the 
way for the moral measure of literature. For one thing, Aristotle mentions 
that plays may corrupt the audience. In addition, his definition 
of a tragedy invites our attention, because a serious and important 
action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author 
or of the characters. And there is one other point in the poetics that 
invites moral evaluation: Aristotle's notion that the distinctive 
function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity 
and fear. He rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to 
that end. The point is that an ethical critic, with an assist from Freud, 
can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with 
a harmless outlet for our hostile urges. In his study <Samuel Johnson,> 
Joseph Wood Krutch takes this line when he says that what Aristotle 
really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions 
may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is "less likely 
that we shall indulge them through our own acts". In Krutch's view, 
this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without 
employing the explicit methods of a moralist. And we can add that 
Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's 
fear that poetry will encourage our passions. If Krutch is correct, 
tragedy may have quite the opposite effect. It may allay our passions 
and so restore the rule of reason. Or in more Freudian terms, 
the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen 
the ego and superego. 

#GOSSON AND SIDNEY#

The second half of 
the sixteenth century in England was the setting for a violent and long 
controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature, especially 
the drama. No one suggested that the ethical effects of the art 
were irrelevant. Both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral 
test, but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or 
a bad influence. Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported 
their cause. Those who wanted to close the theaters, for example, 
pointed to Plato's <Republic> and those who wished to keep them 
open called on the Plato of the <Ion> to testify in their behalf.

The most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps 
Sir Philip Sidney's <An Apologie for Poetrie,> published 
in 1595. Many students of literature know that classical defense. 
What is not so well known, however, and what is quite important for 
understanding the issues of this early quarrel, is the kind of attack 
on literature that Sidney was answering. For this reason, then I want 
to describe, first, two examples of the puritanical attacks: Stephen 
Gosson's <The School of Abuse,> 1579, and his later <Playes 
Confuted,> published in 1582. Second, we will see how Sidney 
answered the charges, for while Sidney's essay was not specifically 
a reply to Gosson, his arguments do support the new theater. 
According to William Ringler's study, <Stephen Gosson,> the theater 
business in London had become a thriving enterprise by 1577, and, 
in the opinion of many, a thoroughly bad business. Aroused by what 
they considered an evil influence, some members of the clergy, joined 
by city authorities, merchants, and master craftsmen, began the attack 
on the plays and the actors for what they called "the abuses of the 
art", but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of 
acting. Although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from 
some men who were not technically Puritans, still, once the Puritans 
gained power, they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance 
of 1642 which decreed that all "public stage-plays shall cease 
and be forborne". With that act of Parliament the opponents of the 
stage won the day, and for more than two decades after that England 
had no legitimate public drama.   In the early days of this controversy 
over the theater one of the interested parties, Stephen Gosson, 
published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses 
of art, rather than the art itself. But his opposition hardened and 
by 1579, in <The School of Abuse,> he was ready to banish all "players". 
He advises women to beware "of those places which in sorrows 
cheere you and beguile you in mirth". He does not really approve 
of levity and laughter, but sex is the deadly sin. He warns that 
a single glance can lead us into temptation, for "Looking eies have 
lyking hartes, and lyking hartes may burne in lust".

But it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions 
at the point just reached. fortunately, it is possible to be somewhat 
more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in 
education. For this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and 
psychological studies of students in American colleges and universities, 
and particularly from the Cornell Values Studies. In the latter 
research program, 
information is available for 2,758 Cornell students 
surveyed in 1950 and for 1,571 students surveyed in 1952. Of the 
latter sample, 944 persons had been studied two years earlier; hence 
<changes> in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals 
at two points in time. In addition, the 1952 study collected 
comparable data from 4,585 students at ten other colleges and universities 
scattered across the country: Dartmouth, Harvard, Yale, Wesleyan, 
North Carolina, Fisk, Texas, University of California at 
Los Angeles, Wayne, and Michigan.   We find, in the first 
place, that <the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education>, 
positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing, do not 
accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the 
public prints, and, on the whole, approve of the way their university 
deals with value-problems and value inculcation. It is not our impression 
that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful 
ignorance; rather, the generality of these students find their 
university experience congenial to their own sense of values.   <Students 
are approximately equally divided between those who regard 
vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those 
who chose a general liberal education>. Other conceivable goals, 
such as character-education and social adjustment, are of secondary 
importance to them. <The ideal of a liberal education impresses itself 
upon the students more and more as they move through college>. Even 
in such technical curricula as engineering, the senior is much more 
likely than the freshman to choose, as an ideal, liberal education over 
specific vocational preparation. In the university milieu of scholarship 
and research, of social diversity, of new ideas and varied and 
wide-ranging interests, "socialization" into a campus culture apparently 
means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education 
in the arts and sciences.   Students' <choices> of ideal 
educational goals <are not arbitrary or whimsical>. There is a clear 
relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic 
pattern of general values. The selective and directional qualities of 
basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data: the 
"success-oriented" 
students choose vocational preparation, the "other-directed" 
choose goals of social adjustment ("getting along with 
people"), the "intellectuals" choose a liberal arts emphasis.

The same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices. 
There is <impressive consistency between specific occupational 
preferences and the student's basic conception of what is for him a 
good way of life>. And, contrary to many popular assertions, the <goal-values 
chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic 
success nor to mere conformity>. Our students want occupations 
that permit them to use their talents and training, to be creative 
and original, to work with and to help other people. They also want 
money, prestige, and security. But they are <optimistic about their 
prospects> in these regards; they set <limits to their aspirations>- 
few aspire to millions of dollars or to "imperial" power and 
glory. Within the fixed frame of these aspirations, they can afford 
to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of 
occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power, 
prestige, and wealth.   Occupational choices are also useful- 
and interesting- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute 
the only component in goals and aspirations. For there is also the 
"face of reality" in the form of the individual's perceptions 
of 
his own abilities and interests, of the objective possibilities open 
to him, of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed. 
We find "reluctant recruits" whose values are not in line with 
their expected occupation's characteristics. Students develop occupational 
images- not always accurate or detailed- and they try to 
fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation. 
The purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute. 
Furthermore, many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands, 
or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity, 
or of ability and performance. Thus, many a creativity-oriented aspirant 
for a career in architecture, drama, or journalism, resigns himself 
to a real estate business; many a people-oriented student who dreams 
of the M&D& decides to enter his father's advertising agency; 
and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were 
better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice 
it. The old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant- but 
so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy.

In their views on dating, courtship, sex, and family 
life, our students prefer what they are expected to prefer. For them, 
in the grim words of a once-popular song, love and marriage go together 
like a horse and carriage. Their expressed standards concerning 
sex roles, desirable age for marriage, characteristics of an ideal mate, 
number of children desired are congruent with the values and stereotypes 
of the preceding generation- minus compulsive rebellion. They 
even accept the "double standard" of sex morality in a double sense, 
i&e&, both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards 
for women, and women apply to both sexes a standard different from 
that held by men.   "Conservatism" and "traditionalism" 
seem implied by what has just been said. But these terms are treacherous. 
<In the field of political values, it is certainly true that 
students are not radical, not rebels against their parents or their peers>. 
And as they go through college, the students tend to bring their 
political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups 
to which they belong. Yet they have accepted most of the extant "welfare 
state" provisions for health, security, and the regulation of 
economic affairs, and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional 
"liberalism" of the Bill of Rights. When their faith in civil 
liberties is tested against strong pressures of social expediency in specific 
issues, e&g&, suppression of "dangerous ideas", many waver 
and give in. The students who are most willing to acquiesce in the 
suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to 
be prejudiced against minority groups, to be conformist and traditionalistic 
in general social attitudes, and to lack a basic faith in people.

As one looks at the existing evidence, one finds a correlation, 
although only a slight one, between high grades and "libertarian" 
values. But the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen. 
In other words, as students go through college, those who are 
most successful academically tend to become more committed to a "Bill 
of Rights" orientation. College in gross- just the general experience- 
may have varying effects, but the <the students who are successful 
emerge with strengthened and clarified democratic values>. 
This finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are 
more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties 
than the other students.   There is now substantial evidence 
from several major studies of college students that <the experience of 
the college years results in a certain, selective homogenization of 
attitudes and values>. Detached from their prior statuses and social 
groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu, 
the students tend to assimilate a new common <culture>, to converge 
toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus. Furthermore, 
in certain respects, there are norms common to colleges and universities 
across the country. For instance, college-educated people consistently 
show up in study after study as more often than others supporters 
of the Bill of Rights and other democratic rights and liberties. 
The interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which 
students tend to converge include toleration of diversity. 
To the extent that our sampling of the orientations of American college 
students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our 
culture- and still valid in 1959- <we are disposed to question the 
summary characterization of the current generation as silent, beat, 
apathetic>, or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided 
solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes. Our data 
indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing 
institutions of the society, and, in the face of the realities of complex 
and large-scale economic and political problems, make a wary and 
ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized 
responsibility for coping with such collective concerns. <In 
a real sense they are admittedly conservative>, but their conservatism 
incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original "radicalism" 
of 1776. Although we have no measures of its strength or intensity, 
the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained. 
As they move through the college years our young men and women are "socialized" 
into a broadly similar culture, at the level of personal 
behavior. In this sense also, they are surely conformists. It is 
even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity- "everyone 
does it"- as a criterion for conduct. But the extent of 
ethical robotism is easily overestimated. Few students are really so 
faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our 
institutions of higher learning. And it may be well to recall that to 
say 
"conformity" is, in part, another way of saying "orderly human 
society".   In the field of religious beliefs and values, the 
college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture. 
Their commitments are, for the most part, couched in a familiar idiom. 
<Students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate 
personal philosophy. Avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as 
to be a curiosity>. The religious quest is often intense and deep, 
and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with 
the most profound questions of meaning and value. At the same time, 
a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means 
of personal adjustment, an anchor for family life, a source of emotional 
security. These personal and social goals often overshadow the 
goals of intellectual clarity, and spiritual transcendence. The "cult 
of adjustment" does exist. It exists alongside the acceptance of 
traditional forms of organized religion (church, ordained personnel, 
ritual, dogma). Still another segment of the student population consists 
of those who seek, in what they regard as religion, intellectual clarity, 
rational belief, and ethical guidance and reinforcement.

Our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly 
orthodox and religiously involved. Upon second thought we were 
forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks 
against which we might compare the present situation, and that conclusions 
that present-day students are "more" or "less" religious 
could not be defended on the basis of our data. As we looked more intently 
at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation, 
we received the impression that many of the religious convictions 
expressed represented a conventional acceptance, of low intensity. 
But, here again, comparative benchmarks are lacking, and we do not 
know, in any case, what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect 
from healthy, young, secure and relatively inexperienced persons; 
after all, feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions 
of youth. Nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at 
all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country. 
Kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values 
during a period of years, primarily 1935-1955, but extending much farther 
back in some instances. A variety of data are assembled to bear 
upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality, work-success 
ethic, individualism, achievement, lessened emphasis on future-time 
orientation in favor of sociability, moral relativism, consideration and 
tolerance, conformity, hedonistic present-time orientation. Although 
he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion 
and the alleged increase in conformity, and thinks that "hedonistic" 
present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed 
to it, he does conclude that Americans increasingly enjoy leisure 
without guilt, do not stress achievement so much as formerly, are more 
accepting of group harmony as a goal, more tolerant of diversity and 
aware of other cultures.

From New Jersey, Morgan hastened to the headquarters of Washington 
at Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, arriving there on November 18th. 
There was much sickness in the corps, and the men were, in addition, 
without the clothing, shoes, and blankets needed for the winter weather. 
Morgan himself had sciatica again. Even on his tough constitution, 
the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest.

On the morning of November 17th, Cornwallis and 2,000 
men had left Philadelphia with the object of capturing Fort Mercer 
at Red Bank, New Jersey. In order to prevent this, Washington hastened 
to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort, including a force 
under the Marquis de Lafayette containing some 160 of Morgan's 
riflemen, all who were fit for duty at this time, the rest having no shoes. 
Although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of Cornwallis, 
Morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing 
at the redcoats. A picket guard of about 350, mostly Hessians, were 
attacked by the Americans under Lafayette, and driven back to their 
camp, some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire.

"I never saw men", Lafayette declared in regard to the 
riflemen, "so merry, so spirited, and so desirous to go on to the 
enemy, whatever force they might have, as that small party in this fight". 
Nathanael Greene told Washington that "Lafayette was charmed 
with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen". 
A few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an 
attack upon the American camp. The British general moved his forces 
north from Philadelphia to Chestnut Hill, near the right wing of 
the patriot encampment. Here the Pennsylvania militia skirmished with 
the British, but soon fled. Morgan was ordered to attack the enemy, 
who had meantime moved to Edge Hill on the left of the Americans. 
Similar orders were given to the Maryland militia. Morgan immediately 
disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait. 
A body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope, a tempting 
target for the riflemen, who threw a volley into their ranks and "messed 
up" the smart formation considerably. Now the riflemen and the 
Marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the British, 
giving them another telling round of fire. The redcoats ran like 
rabbits. But the Maryland militia had likewise fled, all too typical 
of this type of soldier during the Revolution, an experience which gave 
Morgan little confidence in militia in general, as he watched other 
instances of their breaking in hot engagements. The British, although 
suffering considerable losses, noted the defection of the Marylanders, 
made a stand, then turned and attacked Morgan who became greatly 
outnumbered and had to retire.   The Americans lost forty-four 
men, among them Major Joseph Morris of Morgan's regiment, an 
officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection, not only by his 
commander, but by Washington and Lafayette as well. The latter was 
so upset on learning of the death of Morris, that he wrote Morgan 
a letter, showing his own warmhearted generosity. After complimenting 
Morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to Congress, 
too, the ardent Frenchman added he felt that Congress should make 
some financial restitution to the widow and family of Morris, but that 
he 
knew Morgan realized how long such action usually required, if it was 
done at all. "As Mrs& Morris may be in some want before that 
time", Lafayette continued, "I am going to trouble you with a commission 
which I beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy. If 
she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of 
Congress, it would not become a stranger, unknown to her, to offer himself 
for that purpose. But you could (as from yourself) tell her that 
you had friends who, being with the army, don't know what to do with 
their money and **h would willingly let her have one or many thousand 
dollars". This was accordingly done, and the plight of the grateful 
Mrs& Morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan, 
the amount of which is not known.   Apparently still sensitive 
about the idea with which General Gates had approached him at Saratoga, 
namely, that George Washington be replaced, Morgan was vehement 
in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around 
Philadelphia. Richard Peters, Secretary of the Board of War, thought 
Morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying 
to pick a quarrel. Morgan hotly denied this and informed the Board 
of War that the men in camp linked the name of Peters with the plot 
against Washington. Peters insisted that this impression was a great 
misunderstanding, and evidently, from the quarrel, obtained an unfavorable 
impression of Morgan's judgment. Such a situation regarding 
the Board of War could hardly have helped Morgan's chances for 
promotion when that matter came before the group later on.   In 
late December, the American army moved from Whitemarsh to Valley 
Forge, and although the distance was only 13 miles, the journey took 
more than a week because of the bad weather, the barefooted and almost 
naked men. The position of the new camp was admirably selected and 
well fortified, its easily defensible nature being one good reason why 
Howe did not attack it. Besides helping to prevent the movement of 
the British to the west, Valley Forge also obstructed the trade between 
Howe's forces and the farmers, thus threatening the vital subsistence 
of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary 
supplies extremely hazardous. In order to see that this hindering 
situation remained effective, Washington detached several bodies of his 
troops to the periphery of the Philadelphia area.   Morgan and 
his corps were placed on the west side of the Schuylkill River, with 
instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and 
to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy. The headquarters 
of Morgan was on a farm, said to have been particularly well located 
so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the British, a 
practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for 
British gold rather than the virtually worthless Continental currency. 
In his dealings with offenders, however, Morgan was typically 
firm but just. For example, he captured some persons from York County, 
who with teams were taking to Philadelphia the furniture of a man 
who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife, 
and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household 
goods. Morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its 
thankful owners, but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free.

Morgan complained to Washington about the men detailed to him 
for scouting duty, most of them he said being useless. "They straggle 
at such a rate", he told the commander-in-chief, "that if the 
enemy were enterprising, they might get two from us, when we would take 
one of them, which makes me wish General Howe would go on, lest any 
incident happen to us".   If the hardships of the winter at 
Valley Forge were trying for healthy men, they were, of course, much 
more so for those not in good health. Daniel Morgan's rheumatic condition 
worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather. He 
had braved the elements and the enemy, but the strain, aided by the winter, 
was catching up with him at last. Also, he was now forty-three 
years old. The mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the 
troops at Valley Forge could be handled by a subordinate, he felt, 
so like Henry Knox, equally loyal to Washington, who went to Boston 
at this time, Morgan received permission to visit his home in Virginia 
for several weeks. In his absence, the rifle regiment was under 
the command of Major Thomas Posey, another able Virginian. 
But Morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a William 
Pickman in Salem, Massachusetts, apparently an acquaintance, praising 
Washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were 
"opposed by the general current of the people **h to exalt General 
Gates at the expense of General Washington was injurious to the latter. 
If there be a disinterested patriot in America, 'tis General 
Washington, and his bravery, none can question".   It is doubtful 
if Morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children, 
for his pay, as shown by the War Department Abstracts of early 
1778 was $75 a month as a colonel, and that apt to be delayed. He 
was shown a warm welcome regardless, and spent the time in Winchester 
recuperating from his ailment, enjoying his family and arranging his 
private affairs which were, of course, run down. His neighbors celebrated 
his return, even if it was only temporary, and Morgan was especially 
gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend, Isaac 
Lane, who told him, "A man that has so often left all that is dear 
to him, as thou hast, to serve thy country, must create a sympathetic 
feeling in every patriotic heart".   There must have been special 
feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of Daniel Morgan too, 
when the news was received on April 30th of the recognition by France 
of the independence of the United States. His fellow Virginian, 
George Washington, had stated, "I believe no event was ever received 
with more heartfelt joy". The dreary camp at Valley Forge 
was turned into an arena of rejoicing. Even the dignified Washington 
indulged in a game of wickets with some children. His soldiers on the 
whole did not celebrate so mildly. On May 6th, Morgan, who had returned, 
received from Washington orders to "send out patrols under 
vigilant officers" to keep near the enemy. "The reason for this", 
the orders said, "is that the enemy may think to take advantage of 
the celebration of this day. The troops must have more than the common 
quantity of liquor, and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness 
among them".   Apparently no serious disorders resulted from 
the celebration, and within a few days, Morgan joined the force of 
Lafayette who now had command of some 2,000 men at Barren Hill, not 
far above Philadelphia on the Schuylkill. The Frenchman had been 
ordered to approach the enemy's lines, harass them and get intelligence 
of their movements. Interestingly enough, the order transmitted 
to Morgan through Alexander Hamilton also informed him that "A party 
of Indians will join the party to be sent from your command at Whitemarsh, 
and act with them". These were Oneida Indians. 
Washington evidently was anxious for Morgan to be cautious as well 
as aggressive, for on May 17th, 18th and 20th he admonished the leader 
of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert. Obviously the commander-in-chief 
had confidence that Morgan would furnish him good intelligence 
too, for on the 23rd of May, he told Morgan that the British were 
prepared to move, perhaps in the night, and asked Morgan to have two 
of his best horses ready to dispatch to General Smallwood with the 
intelligence obtained. Meantime, however, this same General Smallwood 
seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American army. Colonel 
Benjamin Ford wrote to Morgan from Wilmington that he understood 
a Mrs& Sanderson from Maryland had obtained permission from Smallwood 
to visit Philadelphia, and would return on May 26th, escorted 
by several officers from Maryland "belonging to the new levies 
in the British service". Ford urged Morgan to capture these men, 
who, he thought, might be disguised as Quakers or peasants. Morgan took 
the suggested steps, but when Mrs& Sanderson appeared, there was 
nobody with her but her husband, whom he promptly sent to headquarters 
to be questioned. But Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence 
much more important to his commanding general. A letter of a 
few days later from Washington's aide to Morgan stated, "His Excellency 
is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion". 
For by now the original cause of the quarrel, Philip's seizure of 
Gascony, was only one strand in the spider web of French interests that 
overlay all western Europe and that had been so well and closely 
spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to 
the other. Even so, Edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen 
that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace 
was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that 
left England for Rome during that period had very little to do with 
it.   It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures 
on the pope. Nogaret is hardly an impartial witness, and even he 
did 
not make his charges against Boniface until the latter was dead, but 
there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say. 
It was not merely a hunger for "money, gold and precious objects" 
that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war 
to an end; the pope was playing a dangerous game, with so many balls 
in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears, 
and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage 
of every change in the delicate balance of European affairs. When the 
negotiations began, his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily 
in abeyance, and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there 
was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who, under 
Charles of Valois, 
the papal vicar of Tuscany, were so valuable in 
the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies. 
If his circumspection in regard to Philip's sensibilities went so 
far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of 
Amadee's daughter, Agnes, to the son of the dauphin of Vienne- 
a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas, for Savoy 
and Dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides- for fear 
that he might seem to be favoring the anti-French coalition, he would 
certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return 
of Gascony to Edward, even though, as he admitted to the English 
ambassadors, he had been advised that the original cession was invalid. 
On the other hand, he did not want to offend Edward either, and 
he found himself in a very difficult position. On the surface, the whole 
question was purely feudal. The French were now occupying Gascony 
and Flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited 
them by a breach of the feudal contract. But Edward was invading 
Scotland for precisely the same reason, and his insubordinate vassal 
was the ally of the king of France. Boniface had to uphold the sacredness 
of the feudal contract at all costs, for it was only as suzerain 
of Sicily and of the Patrimony of Peter that he had any justification 
for his Italian wars, but in the English-Scottish-French triangle 
it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one 
of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other 
two.   Because of these involvements in the matter at stake, Boniface 
lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification 
for the position of arbiter, and in retrospect that would 
seem to be 
sufficient reason why the English embassies to the Curia proved 
so fruitless. But when the situation was so complicated that even 
Nogaret, one of the principal actors in the drama, could misinterpret 
the pope's motives, it is possible that Othon and his companions, 
equally baffled, attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause. 
This was Boniface's monumental tactlessness. "Tact", by 
its very derivation, implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other 
people, but the author of <Clericis Laicos> and <Unam Sanctam>, 
the wielder of the two swords, the papal sun of which the imperial 
moon was but a dim reflection, the peer of Caesar and vice-regent 
of Christ, was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten 
what they were like. He was a learned and brilliant man, one of the 
best jurists in Europe and with flashes of penetrating insight, and yet 
in his dealings with other people, particularly when he tried to be 
ingratiating, he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come 
only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives.

This lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men 
as Pierre Flotte and his associates, that "brilliant group of mediocre 
men", as Powicke calls them, who provided the brains for the 
French embassy that came to Rome under the nominal leadership of the 
archbishop of Narbonne, the duke of Burgundy, and the count of St&-Pol. 
They had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence 
and astuteness, they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles 
like Othon or even the older generation of clerks like Hotham, and 
they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized. 
Boniface was later to explain to the English that Robert 
of Burgundy and Guy de St&-Pol were easy enough to do business with; 
it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say 
that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing 
with them he never knew whether he had to do with a Frenchman or 
with a devil. To the pope, head of the universal Church, to the duke 
of Burgundy, taking full advantage of his position on the borders 
of France and of the Empire, or to Othon, who found it quite natural 
that he should do homage to Edward for Tipperary and to the count 
of Savoy for Grandson, Flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely 
incomprehensible. And yet he made no pretense about it; when 
the pope, trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature, said to him, 
"You have already taken Normandy. Do you want to drive the king 
of England from all his overseas possessions"? the Frenchman's 
answer was a terse "Vous dites vrai". Loyal and unscrupulous, 
with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies, he 
outmatched the English diplomats time and time again until, by a kind 
of poetic justice, he fell at the battle of Courtrai, the victim of 
the equally nationalistic if less articulate Flemings.   The 
English, relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior 
diplomatic skill, were also hampered in their negotiations by the events 
that were taking place at home. The Scots had found a new leader 
in William Wallace, and Edward's yearly expeditions across the Border 
called for evermounting taxes, which only increased his difficulties 
with the barons and the clergy. He was unable to send any more 
help to his allies on the Continent, and during the next few years many 
of them, left to resist French pressure unaided, surrendered to the 
inevitable and made their peace with Philip. The defeat and death 
of Adolf 
of Nassau at the hands of Albert of Habsburg also worked to 
the disadvantage of the English, for all the efforts to revive the 
anti-French coalition came to nothing when Philip made an alliance with 
the new king of the Romans.   These shifts in alliance and 
allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the English 
embassy as a whole, but also directly involved the two Savoyards, Amadee 
and Othon. In spite of the armistice negotiated by Amadee two 
years earlier, the war between Bishop Guillaume of Lausanne and Louis 
of Savoy was still going on, and although little is known about 
it, that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle 
against French expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict. 
A second truce had been arbitrated in April, 1298, by Jean 
d'Arlay, lord of Chalon-sur-Saone, the most staunch of 
Edward's 
Burgundian allies, and these last were represented in the discussions 
at the Curia by Gautier de Montfaucon, Othon's neighbor and a 
member of the Vaudois coalition.   But although in many of these 
discussions Othon and Amadee might have been tempted to consider 
their own interests as well as those of the king, Edward's confidence 
in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders 
of the embassy. Amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship 
with the king, but Othon, who at sixty seems still to have been a simple 
knight, merited his position solely by his own character and ability. 
The younger men, Vere, and Pembroke, who was also Edward's 
cousin and whose Lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that 
caused Edward of Carnarvon's irreverent friend, Piers Gaveston, 
to nickname him "Joseph the Jew", were relatively new to the game 
of diplomacy, but Pontissara had been on missions to Rome before, 
and Hotham, a man of great learning, "jocund in speech, agreeable 
to meet, of honest religion, and pleasing in the eyes of all", and an 
archbishop to boot, was as reliable and experienced as Othon himself. 
But all the reports of this first embassy show that the two Savoyards 
were the heads of it, for they were the only ones who were empowered 
to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision 
and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably 
absent.   This also gave them the unpleasant duty of 
being spokesmen for the mission, and they could foresee that that would 
not be easy. Underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and 
papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys 
was the inescapable fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish 
allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain, 
the king of France, in return for being given an equally free hand 
with the insubordinate Scots. This was a doubly bitter blow to the 
king. In the eyes of those who still cared for such things, it was 
a reflection on his honor, and it gave further grounds for complaint to 
his overtaxed subjects, who were already grumbling- although probably 
not in Latin- "Non est lex sana Quod regi sit mea lana". 
Bad relations between England and Flanders brought hard times to the 
shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded 
Flemish cities, and while the English, so far, had done no more than 
grumble, Othon had seen what the discontent might lead to, for before 
he left the Low Countries the citizens of Ghent had risen in protest 
against the expense of supporting Edward and his troops, and the 
regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the 
nasty little riot that ensued.   In all the talk of feudal rights, 
the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers, nor was 
it easy to do so, for all along the road to Italy they passed the Florentine 
pack trains going home with their loads of raw wool from England 
and rough Flemish cloth, the former to be spun and woven by the 
Arte della Lana and the latter to be refined and dyed by the Arte 
della Calimala with the pigment recently discovered in Asia Minor 
by one of their members, Bernardo Rucellai, the secret of which they 
jealously kept for themselves. These chatty merchants made amusing and 
instructive traveling companions, for their business took them to all 
four corners of the globe, and Florentine gossip had already reached 
a high stage of development as even a cursory glance at the <Inferno> 
will prove. A northern ambassador, willing to keep his mouth shut 
and his ears open, could learn a lot that would stand him in good stead 
at the Curia.   They had other topics of conversation, besides 
their news from courts and fairs, which were of interest to Othon, 
the builder of castles in Wales and churches in his native country. 
Behind him lay the Low Countries, where men were still completing 
the cathedrals that a later Florentine would describe as "a malediction 
of little tabernacles, one on top of the other, with so many pyramids 
and spires and leaves that it is a wonder they stand up at all, 
for they look as though they were made of paper instead of stone or marble"; 
the Low Countries, where the Middle Ages were to last for 
another two centuries and die out only when Charles the Bold of Burgundy 
met his first defeat in the fields and forests below the walls 
of Grandson. 
It usually turned out well for him because either he liked the right 
people or there were only a few wrong people in the town. Alfred wanted 
to invest in my father's hotel and advance enough money to build 
a larger place. It was a very tempting offer. My father would have done 
it if it hadn't been for my mother, who had a fear of being in debt 
to anyone- even Alfred Alpert.   In spite of his being well 
liked there were a few people who were very careful about Alfred. 
They had my mother's 
opinion of him: that he was too sharp or a little 
too good to be true. One of the people who was afraid of Alfred 
was his own brother, Lew. I don't know how and I don't know why 
but the two stores, the one in Margaretville and the one in Fleischmanns 
that had been set up as a partnership, were dissolved, separated 
from each other. Everything was all very friendly, except when it came 
to Harry, the youngest brother. Alfred, who was a good deal older 
than Harry, had treated him like a son, and when Harry decided to stay 
in business with Lew instead of going with Alfred, Alfred looked 
on the decision as a betrayal. From that day on he never spoke to Harry 
or to Lew, or to Lew's two boys, Mort and Jimmy. The six 
miles between the towns became an ocean and the Alperts became a family 
of strangers.   Time went on and everybody got older. I became 
fifteen, sixteen, then twenty, and still Tessie Alpert sat on the 
porch with a rose in her hair, and Alfred got richer and sicker with 
diabetes. It was in the spring of the year when he took to his bed and 
Tessie and Alfred found out that they didn't know each other. They 
were like two strangers. The store was their marriage, and when 
Alfred had to leave it there was nothing to hold them together. Tessie, 
everybody thought, was a strong woman, but she was only strong because 
she had Alfred to lean on. And when Alfred was forced into his 
bed, Tessie left the front porch of the store and sat at home, rocking 
in her rocker in the living room, staring out the window- the rose 
still in her hair. Tessie could do nothing for Alfred. She couldn't 
cook or clean or make him comfortable. Instead she waited for Alfred 
to get better and take care of her.   Spring was life- and 
Alfred Alpert in his sickroom was death. Alfred knew that, too. 
I remember him pointing out of the window and saying that he wished he 
could live to see another spring but that he wouldn't.   Alfred 
began to put his affairs in order, and he went about it like a man 
putting his things into storage. My father, who liked Alfred very much, 
was a constant visitor. One day Alfred told him that he had decided 
to leave everything to me. My father, a wise man, asked him not 
to. He knew Alfred liked me; if he wanted to leave me something let 
it be a trinket, nothing else. By leaving me everything he wouldn't 
be doing me a favor, my father told him, and he didn't want to see 
his daughter involved in a lawsuit. He didn't want Alfred to leave 
me trouble because that's all it would be, and Alfred understood.

Alfred was getting too sick to stay in his own home. The doctor 
wanted him in a hospital; the nearest one was forty miles away 
in Kingston. The day Alfred left his home and Fleischmanns he gave 
up the convictions of a lifetime. He sent me for Meltzer the Butcher, 
whom he wanted not as a friend but as a rabbi.   Meltzer knew 
why I had come for him. Solemnly he walked me back to Alfred's 
house without a word passing between us. He entered the house in silence, 
walked into Alfred's room, and closed the door behind him. I 
sat down to wait, and I watched Tessie Alpert, who hadn't moved 
or said a word but kept staring out of the window.   For a few minutes 
there was nothing to hear. Then Meltzer's voice, quiet, calm, 
strong, started the Kaddish, the prayer for the dead. I could hear 
Alfred's voice a few words behind Meltzer's like a counterpoint, 
punctuated by sobs of sorrow and resignation. There was a finality 
in the rhythm of the prayer- it was the end of a life, the end of hope, 
and the wondering if there would ever be another beginning.

Meltzer stayed with Alfred, and when the door opened they both came 
out. Alfred was dressed for his trip to the hospital. The car was 
waiting for him. Alfred, leaning on Meltzer, stopped for a minute to 
look at Tessie. She didn't turn away from the window. Alfred nodded 
a little nod and went out through the door.   Outside, his brother 
Harry was waiting for him- he had come to say good-bye. Alfred 
walked past him without a word and got into the car. Harry ran to 
the side of the car where Alfred was sitting and looked at him, begging 
him to speak. Alfred looked straight ahead. The car began to move 
and Harry ran after it crying, "Alfred! Alfred! Speak to me". 
But the car moved off and Alfred just looked straight ahead. Harry 
followed the car until it reached the main road and turned towards 
Kingston. He stood there watching until it had gone from his sight.

I went to visit Alfred in the Kingston Hospital a few times. 
The first time I went there he asked me to bring him water from 
Flagler's well- water that reminded him of his first days in the 
mountains- and before I came the next time I filled a five-gallon 
jug for him and brought it to the hospital. I don't think he ever 
got to drink any of it.   The jug stayed at the hospital and the 
water- what can happen to water?- it evaporated, disappeared, and 
came back to the earth as rain- maybe for another well or another 
stream or another Alfred Alpert. 

#12 "WHERE IS IT WRITTEN"?# 

Mr& Banks was always called Banks the Butcher until he left 
town and the shop passed over to Meltzer the Scholar who then became 
automatically Meltzer the Butcher. Meltzer was a boarder with the 
Banks family. He came to Fleischmanns directly from the boat that 
brought him to America from Russia. He was a learned man and a very 
gentle soul. He was filled with knowledge of the Bible and the Talmud. 
He knew the whyfores and the wherefores but he was weak, very weak, 
on the therefores. Banks the Butcher took Meltzer the Scholar 
as an apprentice and he made it very clear that a man of learning must 
be able to do more than just quote the Commentaries of the Talmud in 
order to live. So Meltzer learned a new trade from Banks, who supplied 
the town and the hotels with meat.   Banks had a family- 
a wife, a daughter, and a son. The daughter, Lilly, was a very good 
friend of mine and I always had hopes that someday she and Meltzer would 
find each other. They lived in the same house and it didn't seem 
to be such a hard 
thing to do, but the sad realities of Lilly's life 
and the fact that Meltzer didn't love her never satisfied my wishful 
thinking.   Banks the Butcher was a hard master and a hard 
father, a man who didn't seem to know the difference between the living 
flesh of his family and the hanging carcasses of his stock in trade. 
He treated both with equal indifference and with equal contempt; 
perhaps he was a little more sympathetic to the sides of beef that 
hung silently from his hooks.   Lilly Banks and I became friends. 
She was the opposite of everything she should have been- a positive 
pole in a negative home, a living reaction of warmth and kindness 
to the harsh reality of her father. And Lilly's whole family seemed 
to be an apology for Mr& Banks. Her brother Karl was a very gentle 
soul, her mother was a quiet woman who said little but who had hard, 
probing eyes. For every rude word of Mr& Banks's the family 
had five in apology.   Every chance I got I left the hotel to 
visit Lilly. I was free but she was bound to her duties that not even 
the coming of Meltzer lightened. She had to clean the glass on the 
display cases in the butcher shop, help her brother scrub the cutting 
tables with wire brushes, mop the floors, put down new sawdust on the 
floors and help check the outgoing orders. When these chores were 
finished, only then, was she allowed whatever freedom she could find.

I helped Lilly in the store. To me it was a game, to her it 
was the deadly seriousness of life. I wanted to help so that we could 
find time to play. And Lilly allowed me to help so that she could 
have her few little hours of escape.   When the work was finished, 
we would walk. The road past the butcher shop took us along the side 
of a stream. It ran north, away from the town and the people, through 
woods and past the nothingness of a graveyard.   Lilly preferred 
the loneliness of that walk. I would have liked the town and the 
busyness of its people but I always followed Lilly into the peace of 
the silent and unstaring road.   It wasn't hard to understand. 
To me Lilly was a fine and lovely girl. To people who didn't know 
her she was a gawky, badly dressed kid whose arms were too long, whose 
legs were a little too bony. She had the hips of a boy and a loose-jointed 
walk that reminded me of a string of beads strolling down the 
street. And she had the kind of crossed eyes that shocked. It was 
unexpected, unexpected because Lilly walked with her head bent down, 
down, and her mark of friendship was to look into your face. I accepted 
her crossed eyes as she accepted my childishness; childishness compared 
to her grown-up understanding that life was a punishment for as 
yet undisclosed sins. We were almost the same age, she was fifteen, 
I was twelve, and where I felt there was a life to look forward to Lilly 
felt she had had as much of it as was necessary.   When we 
went for our walks Lilly's brother would come along every once in 
a while. Karl was an almost exact copy of his father physically and it 
was strange to see the expected become the unexpected. This huge hulk 
played the guitar and he would take it along on our walks and play 
for us as we sat alone in the woods or by the stream. Karl played well 
and his favorite song was a Schubert lullaby. He spoke no German 
but he could sing it and the words of the song were the only ones he knew 
in a foreign language. The song, he said, was called "The Stream's 
Lullaby", and when he sang, "Gute ruh, Gute ruh, Mach't 
die augen zu" there was such longing and such simple sadness that 
it frightened me. Later, when I was older, I found the song was part 
of Schubert's <Die Scho^ne Mu^llerin>. And even hearing 
it in a concert hall surrounded by hundreds of people the words and 
the melody would make me a little colder and I would reach out for my 
husband's hand.   The brother and sister seemed to be a sort 
of mutual-aid society, a little fortress of kindness for each other in 
a hard world. I felt very flattered to be included in the protection 
of their company even though I had nothing to be protected from.

The turn of the century, or to be more precise, the two decades 
preceeding and following it, marks a great change in the history of 
early English scholarship. At the bottom of this change were great strides 
forward in the technical equipment and technical standards of the 
historian. In archaeology, for example, the contributions of Frederick 
Haverfield and Reginald Smith to the various volumes of the Victoria 
County Histories raised the discipline from the status of an 
antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the 
early English historian. And with the publication of E& T& Leeds' 
<Archaeology of the Anglo-Saxon Settlements> the student 
was presented with an organized synthesis of the archaeological data 
then known.   What was true for archaeology was also true of place-name 
studies. The value of place-names in the reconstruction of early 
English history had long been recognized. Place-names, in fact, 
had been extensively utilized for this purpose from the time of Camden 
onwards. Without a precise knowledge of Germanic philology, however, 
it is debatable whether their use was not more often a source of confusion 
and error than anything else. Even in the nineteenth century 
such accomplished philologists as Kemble and Guest were led into what 
now seem ludicrous errors because of their failure to recognize that 
modern forms of place names are not necessarily the result of logical 
philological development. It was therefore not until the publication 
of J&H& Round's "The Settlement of the South and East 
Saxons", and W&H& Stevenson's "Dr& Guest and the English 
Conquest of South Britain", that a scientific basis for place-name 
studies was established.   Diplomatic is another area for 
which the dawn of the twentieth century marks the beginning of modern 
standards of scholarship. Although because of the important achievements 
of nineteenth century scholars in the field of textual criticism 
the advance is not so striking as it was in the case of archaeology 
and place-names, the editorial principles laid down by Stevenson in 
his great edition of Asser and in his <Crawford Charters> were a 
distinct improvement upon those of his predecessors and remain unimproved 
upon today.   In sum, it can be said that the techniques and 
standards of present day have their origin at the turn of the century. 
And it is this, particularly the establishment of archaeology and 
place-name studies on a scientific basis, which are immediately pertinent 
to the Saxon Shore.   Almost inevitably, the first result 
of this technological revolution was a reaction against the methods and 
in many cases the conclusions of the Oxford school of Stubbs, Freeman 
and (particularly) Green regarding the nature of the Anglo-Saxon 
conquest of Britain. Even before the century was out the tide of 
reaction had set in. Charles Plummer in the introduction and notes to 
his splendid edition of Bede voiced some early doubts concerning the 
"elaborate superstructure" they raised up over the slim foundations 
afforded by the traditional narratives of the conquest. It was Plummer, 
in fact, who coined the much quoted remark: "Mr& Green 
indeed writes as if he had been present at the landing of the Saxons 
and had watched every step of their subsequent progress". Sir Henry 
Howorth, writing in 1898, put himself firmly in the Lappenburg-Kemble 
tradition by attacking the veracity of the West Saxon annals.

Early in the present century, W& H& Stevenson continued 
the attack with a savage article against Guest. Following him in varying 
degrees of scepticism were T&W& Shore, H&M& Chadwick, 
Thomas Hodgkin and F& G& Beck. By 1913, Ferdinand Lot 
could begin an article subtitled "<La conquete de la Grande-Bretagne 
par les Saxons>" with the words, "<Il est difficile aujourd 
'hui d'entretenir des illusions sur la valeur du recit traditionnel 
de la conquete de la Grande-Bretagne> **h". It is also worthy 
of note that Lot cited both Kemble and Lappenberg with favor in 
that article. It would seem that the wheel had turned full circle.

In fact, modern scholarly opinion in the main has not retreated 
all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the 
nineteenth century. Although one meets with occasional extremists like 
Zachrisson or, very recently, Arthur Wade-Evans the majority of 
scholars have taken a middle position between the extremes of scepticism 
and gullibility. Most now admit that Bede, Gildas, Nennius and 
the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles cannot be the infallible guides to early 
English history that Guest, Freeman and Green thought them to be. 
As R&H& Hodgkin has remarked: "The critical methods of 
the nineteenth century shattered most of this picturesque narrative. 
On 
the other hand, the consensus of opinion is that, used with caution 
and in conjunction with other types of evidence, the native sources still 
provide a valid rough outline for the English settlement of southern 
Britain. As Sir Charles Oman once said, "it is no longer fashionable 
to declare that we can say nothing certain about Old English 
origins".   Therefore, in one way Kemble and Lappenberg 
have been vindicated. Their conclusions concerning the untrustworthiness 
of the West Saxon annals, the confused chronology of Bede, the 
unreliability of the early positions of the Anglo-Saxon genealogies 
and the mythological elements contained in Nennius are now mostly accepted. 
Nevertheless, in another way modern historians still labor in 
the vineyard of the Oxford school. For it is their catastrophic concept 
of the Anglo-Saxon invasions rather than Kemble's gradualist 
approach which dominates the field. Despite the rejection of the traditional 
accounts on many points of detail, as late as 1948 it was still 
possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden (beginning 
in ca& 450) influx of Germans as the type of invasions.   At 
this point, of course, the issue has become complicated by a development 
unforeseen by Lappenberg and Kemble. They, however much they were 
in disagreement with the late Victorians over the method by which 
Britain was Germanized, agreed with them that the end result was the 
complete extinction of the previous Celtic population and civilization. 
But beginning, for all practical purposes, with Frederick Seebohm's 
<English Village Community> scholars have had to reckon 
with a theory involving institutional and agrarian continuity between 
Roman and Anglo-Saxon times which is completely at odds with the reigning 
concept of the Anglo-Saxon invasions. Against Seebohm formidable 
foes have taken the field, notably F& W& Maitland, <whose 
Domesday Book and Beyond> was written expressly for this purpose, 
and Sir Paul Vinogradoff whose <The Growth of the Manor> had 
a similar aim. Largely due to their efforts the catastrophic invasion-theory 
has maintained its position although Seebohm has always found 
supporters. H&L& Gray in his <English Field Systems> and 
Zachrisson's <Romans, Kelts and Saxons> defended in part the 
Seebohm thesis while at the present time H&P&R& Finberg and 
Gordon Copley seem to fall into the Celtic survivalist camp. This 
is nevertheless a minority view. Most scholars, while willing to accept 
a survival (revival?) of Celtic art forms and a considerable proportion 
of the Celtic population, reject any institutional legacy from 
pre-Anglo-Saxon Britain.   Therefore, it is plain that the 
clear distinctions of the nineteenth century are no longer with us. 
In the main stream of historical thinking is a group of scholars, H&M& 
Chadwick, R&H& Hodgkin, Sir Frank Stenton et al& 
who are in varying degrees sceptical of the native traditions of the conquest 
but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggested by 
them. They, in effect, have compromised the opposing positions of the 
nineteenth century. On the other side are the Celtic survivalists who 
have taken a tack divergent from both these schools of nineteenth century 
thought. As a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual 
Germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of 
their work, e&g& Seebohm, Gray and Finberg, tends to obscure 
their sympathies. Those who do have occasion to deal with the invasions 
in a more general way, like T&W& Shore and Arthur Wade-Evans, 
are on the side of a gradual and often peaceful Germanic penetration 
into Britain. Wade-Evans, in fact, denies that there were any Anglo-Saxon 
invasions at all other than a minor Jutish foray in A&D& 
514.   Now omitting for a moment some recent developments 
we can say the Saxon Shore hypothesis of Lappenberg and Kemble has 
undergone virtual eclipse in this century. It is no longer possible 
to say that a sceptical attitude towards the received accounts of the 
invasions almost automatically produces a "shore occupied by" interpretation. 
Everyone is more or less sceptical and virtually no one has 
been willing to accept Lappenberg or Kemble's position on that 
point. One reason is, of course, that the new scepticism has been willing 
to maintain the general picture of the invasions as portrayed in 
the traditional sources. The few scholars who have adopted the "shore 
occupied by" interpretation, Howorth, Shore, and Wade-Evans, 
have all been Celtic survivalists. Moreover, they have done so in rather 
special circumstances.   The primary reason for the abandonment 
of the "shore occupied by" thesis has been the assimilation and 
accumulation of archaeological evidence, the most striking feature 
of early English studies in this century. Again omitting recent developments, 
E&T& 
Leeds' dictum of 1913 has stood unchallenged: "So far 
as archaeology is concerned, there is not the least warrant for the 
second (shore occupied by) of these theories". Even earlier Haverfield 
had come to the same conclusion. What they meant was that there 
was no evidence to show that the south and east coasts of Britain received 
Germanic settlers conspicuously earlier than some other parts of 
England. That is, there was no trace of Anglo-Saxons in Britain 
as early as the late third century, to which time the archaeological 
evidence for the erection of the Saxon Shore forts was beginning to 
point. In the face of a clear judgment from archaeology, therefore, it 
became impossible for a time for scholars to re-adopt the "shore settled 
by" theory.   In recent years, however, a wind of change 
seems to be blowing through early English historical circles. The 
great increase in the amount of archaeological activity, and therefore 
information, in the years immediately preceeding and following the Second 
World War has brought to light data which has changed the complection 
of the Saxon Shore dispute. Where there were none fifteen years 
ago, several scholars currently are edging their way cautiously towards 
the acceptance of the "shore occupied by" position. We must, 
therefore, have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine 
the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem. 
#@#

What exactly are we trying to prove? We know that the 
Saxon Shore was a phenonenon of late Roman defensive policy; in 
other words its existence belongs to the period of Roman Britain. So 
whenever the Romans finally withdrew from the island, the Saxon Shore 
disappeared in the first decade of the fifth century. We also know 
that the Saxon Shore as reflected in the <Notitia> was created 
as a part of the Theodosian reorganization of Britain (post-A&D& 
369). My argument is that there was no Saxon Shore prior to that 
time even though the forts had been in existence since the time of Carausius. 
Therefore, what we must prove or disprove is that there were 
Saxons, in the broad sense in which we must construe the word, in 
the area of the Saxon Shore at the time it was called the Saxon Shore. 
That is, we must find Saxons in East Anglia, Kent, Sussex and 
Hampshire in the last half of the fourth century.   The problem, 
in other words, is strictly a chronological one. In Gaul the Saxon 
element on its Saxon Shore was plainly visible because there the 
Saxons were an intrusive element in the population. In Britain, obviously, 
the archaeological and place-name characteristics of the Saxon 
Shore region are bound to be Saxon. It is a matter of trying to 
sort out an earlier fourth-century Saxon element from the later, fifth-century 
mainstream of Anglo-Saxon invasions. This, naturally, will 
be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence 
in this period, with some fortunate exceptions, is insufficient 
for precise chronological purposes.   It might be well to consider 
the literary evidence first because it can provide us with an answer 
to one important question; namely, is the idea that there were Saxon 
mercenaries in England at all reasonable? 
To do so, something was necessary beyond volunteering because there was 
little glamour or romance in the European war; it meant instead 
hardship, dirt, and death.   Baker gave Leonard Wood credit for 
the initiation of the draft of soldiers; from the General's idea 
a chain reaction occurred. Wood took the proposal to Chief of Staff 
Hugh L& Scott, who passed it on to Baker a month before the actual 
declaration of war against Germany. The Secretary of War gave 
his assent after studying the history of the draft in the American 
Civil War as well as the British volunteer system in World War /1,. 
He concluded that selective service would not only prevent the disorganization 
of essential war industries but would avoid the undesirable 
moral effects of the British reliance on enlistment only- "where 
the feeling of the people was whipped into a frenzy by girls pinning 
white feathers on reluctant young men, orators preaching hate of the 
Germans, and newspapers exaggerating enemy outrages to make men enlist 
out of motives of revenge and retaliation". Baker took the plan 
to Wilson who said: "Baker, this is plainly right on any ground. 
Start to prepare the necessary legislation so that if I am obliged 
to go to Congress the bills will be ready for immediate consideration". 
The result was that by secret agreement draft machinery was actually 
ready long before the country knew that the device was to take 
the place of the volunteering method which Theodore Roosevelt favored. 
Before the Draft Act was passed Baker had confidentially briefed 
governors, sheriffs, and prospective draft board members on the administration 
of the measure- and the confidence was kept so well that 
only one newspaper learned what was going on. It was Baker, working 
through Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder and Major Hugh S& ("Old 
Ironpants") Johnson, who arranged for a secret printing by the 
million of selective service blanks- again before the Act was passed- 
until corridors in the Government Printing Office were full 
and the basement of the Washington Post Office was stacked to the ceiling. 
General Crowder proposed that Regular Army officers select 
the draftees in cities and towns throughout the nation; it was Baker 
who thought of lessening the shock, which conscription always brings 
to a country, by substituting "Greetings from your neighbors" for 
the recruiting sergeant, and registration in familiar voting places 
rather than at military installations.   Even so, the Draft Act 
encountered rough sledding in its progress through the Congress. Democratic 
Speaker Champ Clark saw little difference between a conscript 
and a convict. Democrat Stanley H& Dent, Chairman of the 
House Military Affairs Committee, declined to introduce the bill. 
Democratic Floor Leader Claude Kitchin would have no part of the 
measure. In the judgment of Chief of Staff Scott it was ironic that 
the draft policy of a Democratic President, aimed at Germany, had 
to be pushed through the House of Representatives by the ranking minority 
member of the Military Affairs Committee- a Republican Jew 
born in Germany! He was Julius Kahn for whom the Chief of Staff 
thought no honor could be too great. After Kahn's death in 1924 
Scott wrote: "May he rest in peace with the eternal gratitude 
of his adopted country".   In spite of powerful opposition the 
Draft Act finally passed Congress on May 17, 1917. In early June 
ten million young men registered by name and number. The day passed 
without incident in spite of the warning of Senator James A& Reed 
of Missouri: "Baker, you will have the streets of our American 
cities running with blood on registration day". On July 20, the 
first drawing of numbers occurred in the Senate Office Building before 
a distinguished group of congressmen and high Army officers. Secretary 
of War Baker, blindfolded, put his hand into a large glass 
bowl and drew the initial number of those to be called. It was 258. 
A man in Mississippi wired: "Thanks for drawing 258- that's 
me". He was the first of 2,800,000 called to the Army through the 
selective service system. ##

It was one thing to call men to the 
colors; it was another to house, feed, and train them. The existing 
Army posts were wholly inadequate. In a matter of months the War 
Department built thirty-two camps, each one accommodating fifty thousand 
men- sixteen were under canvas in the South and sixteen with frame 
structures in the North. It was a gargantuan task; a typical 
cantonment in the North had twelve hundred buildings, an electric-sewer-water 
system, and twenty-five miles of roads. At Camp Taylor in Kentucky 
a barracks was built in an hour and a half from timber that had 
been standing in Mississippi forests one week before. The total 
operation 
was a construction project comparable in magnitude with the Panama 
Canal, but in 1917 time was in short supply; in three months 
the Army spent three-quarters as much as had been expended on the "big 
Ditch" in ten years.   In later years Josephus Danielswas 
to 
claim that World War /1, was the first in American history in which 
there was great concern for both the health and morals of our soldiers. 
It was the first American war in which the death rate from disease 
was lower than that from battle, due to the provision of trained 
medical personnel (of the 200,000 officers, 42,000 were physicians), compulsory 
vaccination, rigorous camp sanitation, and adequate hospital 
facilities. To the middle of September 1918, there had been fewer than 
10,000 deaths from disease in the new army. This enviable record 
would have been maintained but for a great and unexpected disaster which 
struck 
the world with murderous stealth. It was the influenza pandemic 
of 1918-19. The malady was popularly known as the "Spanish flu" 
from the alleged locale of its origin. The world-wide total of deaths 
from "Spanish flu" was around twenty million; in the United 
States 300,000 succumbed to it. In mid-September 1918, the influenza-pneumonia 
pandemic swept through every American military camp; during 
the eight-week blitz attack 25,000 soldiers died from the disease 
and the death rate (formerly 5 per year per 1,000 men) increased almost 
fifty times to 4 <per week> per 1,000 men. In spite of this catastrophe 
the final mortality figure from disease in the American Army 
during World War /1, was 15 per 1,000 per year, contrasted with 
110 per 1,000 per year in the Mexican War, and 65 in the American Civil 
War.   Both Secretary of War Baker and Secretary of Navy 
Daniels devoted much time and effort to the problem of providing 
reasonably normal and wholesome activities in camp for the millions of 
men who had been removed from their home environment. Their policy 
ran counter to the traditional idea that a good fighter was usually a 
libertine, and that in sex affairs "God-given passion" was a proof 
of manliness. Baker moved first; six days after war was declared 
he appointed Raymond Fosdick chairman of the Commission on Training 
Camp Activities (the ~CTCA). Fosdick, a brother of minister 
Harry Emerson Fosdick, was a graduate of Princeton, and a member of 
Phi Beta Kappa and the American Philosophical Association. His 
assignment was not a new one because Baker had sent him to the Mexican 
border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack 
of discipline, drunkenness, and venereal disease in American military 
camps. Fosdick had found the installations surrounded by a battery of 
saloons and houses of prostitution, with <filles de joie> from all 
over the country flocking to San Antonio, Laredo, and El Paso to 
"woman the cribs". He also ascertained that many officers were 
indifferent to the problem, including Commanding General Frederick 
Funston who gave Fosdick the nickname of "Reverend". On the basis 
of the long chronicle of military history Funston and his brethren 
assumed that the issue was insoluble and that anyone interested in a 
mission like Fosdick's was an impractical idealist or a do-gooder.

During the brief Mexican venture Fosdick's report to the 
Secretary recommended a definite stand by the War Department against 
the saloon and the excesses of prostitution. The problem involved military 
necessity as much as morality, for in pre-penicillin days venereal 
disease was a crippling disability. Fosdick insisted that a strong 
word was needed from Washington, and it was immediately forthcoming. 
Baker put the "cribs" and the saloons out of bounds, ordered the 
co-operation of military officers with local law authorities, and told 
communities that the troops would be moved unless wholesome conditions 
were restored. Both Baker and Fosdick knew that a substitute was 
necessary, that a <verboten> approach was not the real answer. They 
were aware that soldiers went to town, in more ways than one, because 
of the monotony of camp life, to find the only release available in 
the absence of movies, reading rooms, and playing fields with adequate 
athletic equipment. Both knew that when trains stopped at Texan crossroads 
bored soldiers would sometimes enter to ask the passengers if 
they had any reading material to spare, even a newspaper. There was 
no time in the short Mexican encounter to evolve a solution but the 
area provided a proving ground for new departures in the near future.

When the United States entered the First World War Baker 
made certain that the Draft Act of 1917 prohibited the sale of liquor 
to men in uniform and that it provided for broad zones around the camps 
in which prostitution was outlawed. Even so Fosdick, as the new 
Chairman of the Commission on Training Camp Activities, encountered 
strong and vociferous opposition. New Orleans had a notorious red-light 
district extending over twenty-eight city blocks, and the business-minded 
mayor of the city journeyed to Washington to present the 
case for "the God-given right of men to be men". In Europe, Premier 
Clemenceau, showing his animal proclivities as the "Tiger of 
France", asked Pershing by letter for the creation of special houses 
where the sexual desires of American men could be satisfied. When 
Fosdick showed the letter to Baker his negative response was: "For 
God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the President or 
he'll stop the war". Ultimately Fosdick's "Fit to fight" 
slogan swept across the country and every well-known red-light district 
in the United States was closed, a hundred and ten of them. The 
result was that the rate of venereal disease in the American Army 
was the lowest in our military history.   This was the negative 
side of the situation. Affirmatively Baker worked on the premise that 
"young men spontaneously prefer to be decent, and that opportunities 
for wholesome recreation are the best possible cure for irregularities 
in conduct which arise from idleness and the baser temptations". 
The wholesome activities were to be provided by many organizations including 
the ~YMCA, the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare 
Board, the American Library Association, and the Playground and 
Recreation Association- private societies which voluntarily performed 
the job that was taken over almost entirely by the Special Services 
Division of the Army itself in World War /2,. Over these 
voluntary agencies, in 1917-18, the ~CTCA served as a co-ordinating 
body in carrying out what <Survey> called "the most stupendous 
piece of social work in modern times". Under Fosdick the first 
executive officer of the ~CTCA was Richard Byrd, whose name in 
later years was to become synonymous with activities at the polar antipodes. 
From the point of view of popularity the best-known member of 
the Commission was Walter Camp, the Yale athlete whose sobriquet 
was "the father of American football". He was placed in charge of 
athletics, and among other things adapted the type of calisthenics known 
as the daily dozen. The ~CTCA program of activities was profuse: 
William Farnum and Mary Pickford on the screen, Elsie Janis 
and Harry Lauder on the stage, books provided by the American 
Library Association, full equipment for games and sports- except that 
no "bones" were furnished for the all-time favorite pastime played 
on any floor and known as "African golf". The ~CTCA distributed 
a khaki-bound songbook that provided the impetus for spirited 
renditions of the selections found therein, plus a number of others 
whose lyrics were more earthy- from "Johnny Get Your Gun" to 
"Keep the Home Fires Burning" to "Mademoiselle from Armentieres". 
In the imagination of the nineteenth century the Greek tragedians and 
Shakespeare stand side by side, their affinity transcending all the 
immense contrarieties of historical circumstance, religious belief, and 
poetic form.   We no longer use the particular terms of Lessing 
and Victor Hugo. But we abide by their insight. The word "tragedy" 
encloses for us in a single span both the Greek and the Elizabethan 
example. The sense of relationship overreaches the historical 
truth that Shakespeare may have known next to nothing of the actual 
works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. It transcends the 
glaring fact that the Elizabethans mixed tragedy and comedy whereas 
the Greeks kept the two modes severely distinct. It overcomes our emphatic 
awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the 
two languages and styles of dramatic presentation. The intimations of 
a related spirit and ordering of human values are stronger than any 
sense of disparity. Comparable visions of life are at work in <Antigone> 
and <Romeo and Juliet>. We see at once what Victor Hugo 
means when he calls Macbeth a northern scion of the house of Atreus. 
Elsinore seems to lie in a range of Mycenae, and the fate of Orestes 
resounds in that of Hamlet. The hounds of hell search out their 
quarry in Apollo's sanctuary as they do in the tent of Richard /3,. 
Oedipus and Lear attain similar insights by virtue of similar blindness. 
It it not between Euripides and Shakespeare that the western 
mind turns away from the ancient tragic sense of life. It is after 
the late seventeenth century. I say the late seventeenth century because 
Racine (whom Lessing did not really know) stands on the far side 
of the chasm. The image of man which enters into force with Aeschylus 
is still vital in <Phedre> and <Athalie>.   It is the 
triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysics which marks the point 
of no return. Shakespeare is closer to Sophocles than he is to Pope 
and Voltaire. To say this is to set aside the realness of time. But 
it is true, nevertheless. The modes of the imagination implicit in 
Athenian tragedy continued to shape the life of the mind until the age 
of Descartes and Newton. It is only then that the ancient habits 
of feeling and the classic orderings of material and psychological experience 
were abandoned. With the <Discours de la methode> and the 
<Principia> the things undreamt of in Horatio's philosophy seem 
to pass from the world.   In Greek tragedy as in Shakespeare, 
mortal actions are encompassed by forces which transcend man. The reality 
of Orestes entails that of the Furies; the Weird Sisters wait 
for the soul of Macbeth. We cannot conceive of Oedipus without a 
Sphinx, nor of Hamlet without a Ghost. The shadows cast by the personages 
of Greek and Shakespearean drama lengthen into a greater darkness. 
And the entirety of the natural world is party to the action. 
The thunderclaps over the sacred wood at Colonus and the storms in 
<King Lear> are caused by more than weather. In tragedy, lightning 
is a messenger. But it can no longer be so once Benjamin Franklin 
(the incarnation of the new rational man) has flown a kite to it. The 
tragic stage is a platform extending precariously between heaven and 
hell. Those who walk on it may encounter at any turn ministers of grace 
or damnation. <Oedipus> and <Lear> instruct us how little of 
the world belongs to man. Mortality is the pacing of a brief and dangerous 
watch, and to all sentinels, whether at Elsinore or on the battlements 
at Mycenae, the coming of dawn has its breath of miracle. It 
banishes the night wanderers to fire or repose. But at the touch of 
Hume and Voltaire the noble or hideous visitations which had haunted 
the mind since Agamemnon's blood cried out for vengeance, disappeared 
altogether or took tawdry refuge among the gaslights of melodrama. 
Modern roosters have lost the art of crowing restless spirits back to 
Purgatory.   In Athens, in Shakespeare's England, and at 
Versailles, the hierarchies of worldly power were stable and manifest. 
The wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre. 
From it, spokes of order and degree led to the outward rim of the 
common man. Tragedy presumes such a configuration. Its sphere is that 
of royal courts, dynastic quarrels, and vaulting ambitions. The same 
metaphors of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to Oedipus 
and Macbeth because they applied also to Alcibiades and Essex. And 
the fate of such men has tragic relevance because it is public. Agamemnon, 
Creon, and Medea perform their tragic actions before the eyes 
of the <polis>. Similarly the sufferings of Hamlet, Othello, 
or Phedre engage the fortunes of the state. They are enacted at the 
heart of the body politic. Hence the natural setting of tragedy is the 
palace gate, the public square, or the court chamber. Greek and Elizabethan 
life and, to a certain extent, the life of Versailles shared 
this character of intense "publicity". Princes and factions clashed 
in the open street and died on the open scaffold.   With the 
rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affairs 
shifted from the public to the private. The art of Defoe and Richardson 
is founded on an awareness of this great change. Heretofore 
an action had possessed the breadth of tragedy only if it involved high 
personages and if it occurred in the public view. Behind the tragic 
hero stands the chorus, the crowd, or the observant courtier. In the 
eighteenth century there emerges for the first time the notion of a 
private tragedy (or nearly for the first time, there having been a small 
number of Elizabethan domestic tragedies such as the famous <Arden 
of Feversham>). In <La Nouvelle-Heloi^se> and <Werther> 
tragedy is made intimate. And private tragedy became the chosen ground 
not of drama, but of the new, unfolding art of the novel. 
The novel was not only the presenter of the new, secular, rationalistic, 
private world of the middle class. It served also as a literary form 
exactly appropriate to the fragmented audience of modern urban culture. 
I have said before how difficult it is to make any precise statements 
with regard to the character of the Greek and Elizabethan public. 
But one major fact seems undeniable. Until the advent of rational 
empiricism the controlling habits of the western mind were symbolic 
and allegoric. Available evidence regarding the natural world, the 
course of history, and the varieties of human action were translated 
into imaginative designs or mythologies. Classic mythology and Christianity 
are such architectures of the imagination. They order the manifold 
levels of reality and moral value along an axis of being which 
extends from brute matter to the immaculate stars. There had not yet 
supervened between understanding and expression the new languages of 
mathematics and scientific formulas. The poet was by definition a realist, 
his imaginings and parables being natural organizations of reality. 
And in these organizations certain primal notions played a radiant 
part, radiant both in the sense of giving light and of being a pole 
toward which all perspectives converge. I mean such concepts as the presence 
of the supernatural in human affairs, the sacraments of grace 
and divine retribution, the idea of preordainment (the oracle over Oedipus, 
the prophecy of the witches to Macbeth, or God's covenant with 
His people in <Athalie>). I refer to the notion that the structure 
of society is a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history 
conforms to patterns of justice and chastisement as if it were a morality 
play set in motion by the gods for our instruction.   These 
conceptions and the manner in which they were transposed into poetry or 
engendered by poetic form are intrinsic to western life from the time 
of Aeschylus to that of Shakespeare. And although they were, as I 
have indicated, under increasing strain at the time of Racine, they 
are still alive in his theatre. They are the essential force behind 
the conventions of tragedy. They are as decisively present in the <Oresteia> 
and <Oedipus> as in <Macbeth, King Lear>, and <Phedre>.

After the seventeenth century the audience ceased to 
be an organic community to which these ideas and their attendant habits 
of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar. Concepts 
such as grace, damnation, purgation, blasphemy, or the chain of 
being, which are everywhere implicit in classic and Shakespearean tragedy, 
lose their vitality. They become philosophic abstractions of 
a private and problematic relevance, or mere catchwords in religious customs 
which had in them a diminishing part of active belief. After Shakespeare 
the master spirits of western consciousness are no longer 
the blind seers, the poets, or Orpheus performing his art in the face 
of hell. They are Descartes, Newton, and Voltaire. And their chroniclers 
are not the dramatic poets but the prose novelists.   The 
romantics were the immediate inheritors of this tremendous change. 
They were not yet prepared to accept it as irremediable. Rousseau's 
primitivism, the anti-Newtonian mythology of Blake, Coleridge's 
organic metaphysics, Victor Hugo's image of the poets as the Magi, 
and Shelley's "unacknowledged legislators" are related elements 
in the rear-guard action fought by the romantics against the new 
scientific rationalism. From this action sprang the idea of somehow uniting 
Greek and Shakespearean drama into a new total form, capable 
of restoring to life the ancient moral and poetic responses. The dream 
of achieving a synthesis between the Sophoclean and the Shakespearean 
genius inspired the ambitions of poets and composers from the time 
of Shelley and Victor Hugo to that of Bayreuth. It could not really 
be fulfilled. The conventions into which the romantics tried to breath 
life no longer corresponded to the realities of thought and feeling. 
But the attempt itself produced a number of brilliant works, and 
these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age 
of Ibsen and Chekhov. ##

The wedding of the Hellenic to the northern 
genius was one of the dominant motifs in Goethe's thought. His 
Italian journey was a poet's version of those perennial thrusts 
across the Alps of the German emperors of the Middle Ages. The dream 
of a descent into the gardens of the south always drew German ambitions 
toward Rome and Sicily. Goethe asks in <Wilhelm Meister> 
whether we know the land where the lemon trees flower, and the light 
of the Mediterranean glows through <Torquato Tasso> and the <Roman 
Elegies>. Goethe believed that the Germanic spirit, with its 
grave strength but flagrant streaks of brutality and intolerance, should 
be tempered with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the Hellenic. 
On the narrower ground of poetic form, he felt that in the drama 
of the future the Greek conception of tragic fate should be joined to 
the Shakespearean vision of tragic will. The wager between God and 
Satan brings on the destiny of Faust, but Faust assumes his role 
voluntarily.   The third Act of <Faust> /2, is a formal celebration 
of the union between the Germanic and the classic, between 
the spirit of Euripides and that of romantic drama. The motif of Faust's 
love for Helen of Troy goes back to the sources of the Faustian 
legend. It tells us of the ancient human desire to see the highest 
wisdom joined to the highest sensual beauty. There can be no greater 
magic than to wrest from death her in whom the flesh was all, in whom 
beauty was entirely pure because it was entirely corruptible. It is 
thus that the brightness of Helen passes through Marlowe's <Faustus>. 
Goethe used the fable to more elaborate ends. Faust rescuing 
Helen from Menelaus' vengeance is the genius of renaissance Europe 
restoring to life the classic tradition. The necromantic change from 
the palace at Sparta to Faust's Gothic castle directs us to the 
aesthetic meaning of the myth- the translation of antique drama into 
Shakespearean and romantic guise.   This translation, or rather 
the fusion of the two ideals, creates the <Gesamtkunstwerk>, 
the "total art form". 
The Bishop of Gloucester described the elder Thomas in 1577 as the 
richest recusant in his diocese, worth five hundred pounds a year in 
lands and goods. When Quiney and William Parsons wrote to Greville 
in 1593 asking his consent in the election for bailiff, they sent the 
letter to Mr& William Sawnders, attendant on the worshipful Mr& 
Thomas Bushell at Marston. Mr& Bushell was mentioned in 1602 
in the will of Joyce Hobday, widow of a Stratford glover. Thomas 
the elder married twice, had seventeen children, and died in 1615. His 
daughter Elinor married Quiney's son Adrian in 1613, and his son 
Henry married Mary Lane of Stratford in 1609. His son Thomas, 
aged fifteen when he entered Oxford in 1582, married as his first wife 
Margaret, sister of Sir Edward Greville. Bridges, a son by his 
second wife, was christened at Pebworth in 1607, but Thomas the younger 
was living at Packwood two years later and sold Broad Marston 
manor in 1622. A third Thomas Bushell (1594-1674), "much loved" 
by Bacon, called himself "the Superlative Prodigall" in <The 
First Part of Youths Errors> (1628) and became an expert on silver 
mines and on the art of running into debt.   Edward Greville, 
born about 1565, had inherited Milcote on the execution of his father 
Lodowick for murder in 1589. He refused his consent to the election 
of Quiney as bailiff in 1592, but gave it at the request of the 
recorder, his cousin Sir Fulke Greville. The corporation entertained 
him for dinner at Quiney's house in 1596/7, with wine and sugar 
sent by the bailiff, Sturley. At Milcote on November 3, 1597, the 
aldermen asked him to support their petition for a new charter. Sturley 
wrote to Quiney that Sir Edward "gave his allowance and liking 
thereof, and affied unto us his best endeavour, so that his rights be 
preserved", and that "Sir Edward saith we shall not be at any 
fault for money for prosecuting the cause, for himself will procure it 
and lay it down for us for the time". Greville proposed Quiney as 
the fittest man "for the following of the cause and to attend him in 
the matter", and at his suggestion the corporation allowed Quiney 
two shillings a day. "If you can firmly make the good knight sure 
to pleasure our Corporation", Sturley wrote, "besides that ordinary 
allowance for your diet you shall have @20 for recompence".

In his letter mentioning Shakespeare on January 24, 1597/8, Sturley 
asked Quiney especially that "theare might [be] bi Sir Ed& 
Grev& some meanes made to the Knightes of the Parliament for 
an ease and discharge of such taxes and subsedies wherewith our towne 
is like to be charged, and I assure u I am in great feare and doubte 
bi no meanes hable to paie. Sir Ed& Gre& is gonne to Brestowe 
and from thence to Lond& as I heare, who verie well knoweth our estates 
and wil be willinge to do us ani good". The knights for Warwickshire 
in this parliament, which ended its session on February 9, 
were Fulke Greville (the poet) and William Combe of Warwick, as Fulke 
Greville and Edward Greville had been in 1593. The corporation 
voted on September 27, 1598, that Quiney should ride to London about 
the suit to Sir John Fortescue, chancellor of the Exchequer, 
for discharging of the tax and subsidy. He had been in London for several 
weeks when he wrote to Shakespeare on October 25. Sturley on 
November 4 answered a letter from Quiney written on October 25 which 
imported, wrote Sturley, "that our countriman **f **f Shak& would 
procure us monei: which I will like of as I shall heare when wheare 
+ howe: and I prai let not go that occasion if it mai sort to 
ani indifferent condicions. Allso that if monei might be had for 30 
or **f a lease +c& might be procured". Sturley quoted Quiney as 
having written on November 1 that if he had "more monei presente much 
might be done to obtaine our Charter enlargd, ij& faires more, with 
tole of corne, bestes, and sheepe, and a matter of more valewe then 
all that". Sturley thought that this matter might be "the rest 
of the tithes and the College houses and landes in our towne". He 
suggested offering half to Sir Edward, fearing lest "he shall thinke 
it to good for us and procure it for himselfe, as he served us the 
last time". This refers to what had happened after the Earl of Warwick 
died in 1590, when the town petitioned Burghley for the right to 
name the vicar and schoolmaster and other privileges but Greville bought 
the lordship for himself. Sturley's allusion probably explains 
why Greville took out the patent in the names of Best and Wells, 
for Sir Anthony Ashley described Best as "a scrivener within Temple 
Bar, that deals in many matters for my L& Essex" through Sir 
Gelly Merrick, especially in "causes that he would not be known 
of".   Adrian Quiney wrote to his son Richard on October 
29 and again perhaps the next day, since the bearer of the letter, the 
bailiff, was expected to reach London on November 1. In his second 
letter the old mercer advised his son "to bye some such warys as yow 
may selle presentlye with profet. yff yow bargen with **f sha **h 
[so in the ~MS] or Receave money ther or brynge your money home 
yow maye see howe knite stockynges be sold ther ys gret byinge of them 
at Aysshom **h. wherefore I thynke yow maye doo good yff yow can have 
money". This seems to refer, not to the loan Richard had asked 
for, but to a proposed bargain with Shakespeare.   Richard Quiney 
the younger, a schoolboy of eleven, wrote a letter in Latin asking 
his father to buy copybooks ("<chartaceos libellos>") for him 
and his brother. His mother Bess, who could not write herself, reminded 
her husband through Sturley to buy the apron he had promised her 
and "a suite of hattes for 5 boies the yongst lined + trimmed with silke" 
(for John, only a year old). A letter signed "Isabell Bardall" 
entreated "Good Cozen" Quiney to find her stepson Adrian, 
son of George Bardell, a place in London with some handicraftsman. 
William Parsons and William Walford, drapers, asked Quiney to 
see to business matters in London. Daniel Baker deluged his "Unckle 
Quyne" with requests to pay money for him to drapers in Watling 
Street and at the Two Cats in Canning Street. His letter of 
October 26 named two of the men about whom Quiney had written to Shakespeare 
the day before. Baker wrote: "I tooke order with **f E& 
Grevile for the payment of Ceartaine monei beefore his going towardes 
London. + synce I did write unto him to dessier him to paie **f 
for mee which standeth mee greatly uppon to have paide. + **f more 
**f peeter Rowswell 
tooke order with his master to paie for mee". He 
asked Quiney to find out whether the money had been paid and, if not, 
to send to the lodging of Sir Edward and entreat him to pay what 
he owed. Baker added: "I pray you delivre these inclosed Letters 
And Comend mee to **f Rychard mytton whoe I know will ffreind 
mee for the payment of this monei". Further letters in November mention 
that Sir Edward paid forty pounds.   Stratford's petition 
to the queen declared that two great fires had burnt two hundred 
houses in the town, with household goods, to the value of twelve thousand 
pounds. The chancellor of the Exchequer wrote on the petition: 
"in myn opinion it is very resonable and conscionable for hir ma<ies>tie 
to graunt in relief of this towne twise afflicted and almost wasted 
by fire". The queen agreed on December 17, a warrant was signed 
on January 27, and the Exchequer paid Quiney his expenses on February 
27, 1598/9. He listed what he had spent for "My own diet in 
London eighteen weeks, in which I was sick a month; my mare at coming 
up 14 days; another I bought there to bring me home 7 weeks; 
and I was six days going thither and coming homewards; all which 
cost me at the least @20". He was allowed forty-four pounds in all, 
including fees to the masters of requests, Mr& Fanshawe of the 
Exchequer, the solicitor general, and other officials and their clerks. 
If he borrowed money from Shakespeare or with his help, he would 
now have been able to repay the loan.   Since more is known about 
Quiney than about any other acquaintance of Shakespeare in Stratford, 
his career may be followed to its sudden end in 1602. During 1598 
and 1599 he made "manye Guiftes of myne owne provision bestowed uppon 
Cowrtiers + others for the better effectinge of our suites in hande". 
He was in London "searching records for our town's causes" 
in 1600 with young Henry Sturley, the assistant schoolmaster. When 
Sir Edward Greville enclosed the town commons on the Bancroft, 
Quiney and others leveled his hedges on January 21, 1600/1, and were 
charged with riot by Sir Edward. He also sued them for taking toll 
of grain at their market. Accompanied by "Master Greene our solicitor" 
(Thomas Greene of the Middle Temple, Shakespeare's "cousin"), 
Quiney tried to consult Sir Edward Coke, attorney general, 
and gave money to a clerk and a doorkeeper "that we might have 
access to their master for his counsel **h butt colde nott have him 
att Leasure by the reason of thees trobles" (the Essex rising on February 
8). He set down that "I gave **f Greene a pynte of muskadell 
and a roll of bread that last morning I went to have his company 
to Master Attorney". After returning to Stratford he drew up a 
defense 
of the town's right to toll corn and the office of collecting it, 
and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and Shakespeare's 
father. No one, he wrote, took any corn of Greville's, for 
his bailiff of husbandry "swore a greate oathe thatt who soe came 
to put hys hande into hys sackes for anye corne shuld leave hys hande 
be hynde hym". Quiney was in London again in June, 1601, and in 
November, when he rode up, as Shakespeare must often have done, by way 
of Oxford, High Wycombe, and Uxbridge, and home through Aylesbury 
and Banbury.   After Quiney was elected bailiff in September, 
1601, without Greville's approval, Greene wrote him that Coke 
had promised to be of counsel for Stratford and had advised "that 
the office of bayly may be exercised as it is taken upon you, (**f Edwardes 
his consent not beinge hadd to the swearinge of you)". Asked 
by 
the townsmen to cease his suit, Greville had answered that "hytt 
shulde coste hym **f first + sayed it must be tried ether before my Lorde 
Anderson in the countrey or his uncle ffortescue in the exchequer 
with whom he colde more prevaile then we". The corporation proposed 
Chief Justice Anderson for an arbiter, sending him a gift of sack 
and claret. Lady Greville, daughter of the late Lord Chancellor 
Bromley and niece of Sir John Fortescue, was offered twenty pounds 
by the townsmen to make peace; she "labored + thought she shuld 
effecte" it but her husband said that "we shuld wynne it by the sworde". 
His servant Robin Whitney threatened Quiney, who had Whitney 
bound to "the good abaringe" to keep the peace. A report of 
**f Edw: Grevyles minaces to the Baileefe Aldermen + Burgesses 
of Stratforde" tells how Quiney was injured by Greville's men: 
"in the tyme **f Ryc' Quyney was bayleefe ther came some of 
them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher 
thei druncke + drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste: att a faier tyme the 
Baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order + comminge by 
in 
**f hurley Burley. came into the howse + commawnded the peace to be 
kept butt colde nott prevayle + in hys endevor to sticle the brawle had 
his heade grevouselye brooken by one of hys [Greville's] men whom 
nether hym selfe [Greville] punnished nor wolde suffer to be punnished 
but with a shewe to turne them awaye + enterteyned agayne". 
The fall of Rome, the discovery of precious metals, and the Protestant 
Reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood 
by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed.

Often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct 
by those individuals or nations which he is studying. Unconsciously, 
governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking 
without fully realizing why they are doing so. They react in obedience 
to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural 
law. A court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling 
that the law is inimical to the numerical majority. A nation may 
go to war on some trifling pretext, when in reality it may have been 
guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake. When 
the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible 
cause and effect sequence, he should be alert to intuition and unconscious 
instinct as possible guides.   Adams firmly contended 
that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical 
environment on history. Here was another indispensable tool. Indeed, 
he concluded that "geographical conditions have exercised a great, 
possibly a preponderating, influence over man's destiny". The failure 
of Greece to reach the imperial destiny that Periclean Athens 
had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical 
conformation. All areas of history were either favorably or adversely 
affected by the geographical environment, and no respectable historian 
could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of 
geography.   Brooks Adams was consistent in his admonishments 
to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess. 
However, as a practicing historian, he, himself, has left few clues 
to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing 
history. In fact, if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness 
of his historicism, they must be based on scanty evidence. What evidence 
is available would seem to indicate that Brooks, unlike his older 
brother Henry, had most of the methodological vices usually found 
in the amateur. A credulousness, a distaste for documentation, an uncritical 
reliance on contemporary accounts, and a proneness to assume 
a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences 
of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate 
the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public. This 
is not to assume that his work was without merit, but the validity 
of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be 
considered against this background of an unprofessional approach.

His credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to <The 
Emancipation of Massachusetts>, which purports to examine the 
trials of Moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the Israelite 
exodus from Egypt and the leadership of the Puritan clergy in 
colonial New England. Much criticism has been leveled at this rather 
forced analogy, but what is equally significant is Adams' complete 
acceptance of the Biblical record as "good and trustworthy history". 
In light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher 
criticism this is a most remarkable statement, particularly coming 
from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views. The desire 
to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique 
smacks more of 
the propagandist than the historian.   A similar amateurish 
characteristic is revealed in Adams' failure to check the 
accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources. If he found data 
that fitted his general plan, he used it and counted his sources trustworthy. 
Conversely, if statistics were uncovered which contradicted 
a cherished theory, the sources were denounced as faulty. Such manipulations 
are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression 
of the monasteries during the English reformation. Adams depended largely 
on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in England, 
claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because 
there were no newspapers. This is certainly an irrational dogmatism, 
in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth 
century on twentieth-century terms. Moreover, he rejects the 
contemporary accounts of Englishmen, casually adjudging them to be distorted 
by prejudice because "the opinions of Englishmen are of no 
great value". What is exposited by this observation is not the inherent 
prejudices of Englishmen but the Anglophobia of Brooks Adams.

In all fairness it must be admitted that Adams made no pretense 
at being an impartial historian. Impartiality to him meant an unwillingness 
to generalize and to search for a synthesis. He deplored the 
impact of German historiography on the writing of history, terming 
it a "dismal monster". Ranke and his disciples had reduced history 
to a profession of dullness; Brooks Adams preferred the chronicles 
of Froissart or the style and theorizing of Edward Gibbon, for 
at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote. He wrote 
eloquently to William James that impartial history was not only 
impossible but undesirable. If the historian was convinced of his own 
correctness, then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by 
disturbing facts. It was history that must be in error, not the historian. 
It was this basic trait that separated Adams from the ranks 
of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what 
was his most serious offense against the historical method- namely, 
the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting 
it to the test of facts.   All of Adams' work reflects this 
dogmatic characteristic. No page seems to be complete without the statement 
of at least one unproved generalization. One example of this 
was his assertion that "**h all servile revolts must be dealt with by 
physical force". There is no explanation of terms nor a qualification 
that most such revolts have been dealt with by force- only a bald 
dogmatism that they must, because of some undefined compulsion, be 
so repelled. On matters of race he was similarly inflexible: "Most 
of the modern Latin races seem to have inherited **h the rigidity 
of the Roman mind". He cites the French Revolution as typifying 
this rigidity but makes no mention of the Italians, who have been able 
to 
adapt to all types of circumstances. He pontificates that "one 
of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value 
of women in men's eyes". It made no difference that most evidence 
points to an opposite conclusion. For Adams had made up his mind before 
all the facts were available.   All critics of Adams and 
his methods have observed this particular deficiency. J& T& Shotwell 
was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the 
fall of the Carolingian empire to the woolen trade, and he urged Adams 
to "transform his essay into a real history, embodying not merely 
those facts which fit into his theory, but also the modifications 
and exceptions". A& M& Wergeland called the Adams method literally 
antihistorical, while Clive Day maintained that the assumptions 
were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight 
factual evidence. Moreover, stated Day, "He always omits 
facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis". Even D& A& Wasson, 
who compared <The Emancipation of Massachusetts> to the lifting 
of a fog from ancient landscapes, was also forced to admit the methodological 
deficiencies of the author.   In summary, Brooks Adams 
felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered 
was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature. 
Moreover, he believed that most professional historians lacked some 
of the essential instruments for a proper study of history. However, 
despite the insight of many of his observations, his own conclusions 
are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the 
correct research methods. This should not prejudice an evaluation of 
his findings, but they were not the findings of a completely impartial 
investigator. What was perhaps more important than his concept of 
the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which 
shaped the direction of his thought. In the final analysis his contribution 
to American historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights 
into religion, economics, and Darwinism, the three factors which 
conditioned his search for a law of history. 

#RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERNATURALISM# 

Brooks Adams considered religion as an extremely significant 
manifestation of man's fear of the unknown. But it was nothing 
more than that. Religion and the churches were institutions which 
had been created by man, not God. He did not deny God; he simply 
did not believe that a Creator intervened or interfered in human 
affairs. The historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems 
suggested by religion. There was no evidence, either of a positive 
or negative type, of the actions of a Divine Being in this world; 
and, since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial 
activity, his research should eliminate the supernatural. Furthermore, 
he must regard religion as the expression of human forces. 
Certainly, he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its 
influence on the flow of history, but he must not confuse the natural 
and the mundane with the divine.   Adams was not breaking new ground 
when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality 
a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment. Students 
of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that 
there was, indeed, a direct connection. But Adams was one of the first 
to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor 
behind religion. It was this fear which explained the development 
of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease 
the angry deities. To keep themselves entrenched in power, the 
priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle. 
It was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business. 
The German barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example:

"The Germans in the fourth century were a very simple 
race, who comprehended little of natural laws, and who therefore referred 
phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention. 
This intervention could only be controlled by priests, and thus the 
invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class. The 
power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the 
miracle, and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as 
did Elijah".   Adams contended that once such a special class 
had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain 
itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between 
God and man. Thus, the Church was born and because of its intrinsic 
character was soon identified as a conservative institution, determined 
to resist the forces of change, to identify itself with the political 
rulers, and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses. 
Doctrine was not only mysterious; it was also sacred, "and no 
believer in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons examined 
as we should examine human laws". These basic ideas concerning the 
nature of religion were, Adams believed, some of the major keys to 
the understanding of history and the movement of society. The dark views 
about the Puritans found in <The Emancipation of Massachusetts> 
were never altered.   Despite their adherence to the <status 
quo>, the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments 
as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge. In <The 
Law of Civilization and Decay> Brooks Adams traced this evolution, 
always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more 
rational, the substance remained unchanged. The relic worship and monasticism 
of the Middle Ages were more advanced forms than were primitive 
fetish worship and nature myths. Yet, the idea imbedded in each 
was identical: to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that 
class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of God. 
To Adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire 
culture of the race was one of imagination, and it is largely the 
admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar 
religiosity- a sentiment he would have probably denied. 
Stephens had written his classic "incidents of travel" about these 
regions a hundred years before, and Catherwood, who had studied Piranesi 
in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece, had drawn 
the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text. Catherwood, an 
architect in New York, had been forgotten, like Stephens, and Victor 
reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs, for a museum, a dinosaur 
from two or three petrified bones. He had unearthed Stephens's 
letters in a New Jersey farmhouse and he discovered Stephens's 
unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of New York, where 
the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic. 
Victor had been stirred by my account of him in <Makers and Finders,> 
for Stephens was one of the lost writers whom Melville had seen 
in his childhood and whom I was bent on resurrecting.   Victor 
had led an adventurous life. His <metier> was the American tropics, 
and he had lived all over Latin America and among the primitive 
tribes on the Amazon river. Well he knew the sleepless nights, the howling 
sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages of the 
Kofanes and Huitotoes. He had not yet undertaken the great exploit 
of his later years, the rediscovery of the ancient Inca highway, the 
route of Pizarro in Peru, but he had climbed to the original El Dorado, 
the Andean lake of Guatemala, and he had scaled the southern Sierra 
Nevada with its Tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald 
mines of Muzo. As a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters 
of the Amazon, he had collected specimens for Mexican museums, 
and he had taken to the London zoo a live quetzal, the sacred bird of 
the old Mayans. In fact, he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in 
the forest of Ecuador. Moreover, he had spent six months on the Galapagos 
islands, among the great turtles that Captain Cook had found 
there, and now and then he would disappear into some small island of 
the West Indies. Victor's book on John Lloyd Stephens was largely 
written in my study in the house at Weston.   I had had my 
name taken out of the telephone book, and this was partly because of 
a convict who had been discharged from Sing Sing and who called me night 
after night. He said he was a friend of Heywood Broun who had 
run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression, 
but the generous Broun to whom I wrote did not know his name and I 
somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling 
round the house. But one day came the voice of a man I had known 
when he was a boy, and I later remembered that this boy, thirty years 
before, had struck me as coming to no good. There had been something 
sinister about him that warned me against him,- I had never felt 
that way about any other boy,- but when he uttered his name on the 
telephone I had forgotten this and I was glad to do what he asked of 
me. He was a captain, he said, in the army, and on the train to New 
York his purse and all his money had been stolen, and would I lend 
him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the General Delivery window? 
Never hearing from him again, I remembered the little boy of whom 
I had had such doubts when he was ten years old. We lived for a 
while in a movie melodrama with a German cook and her son who turned 
out to be Nazis. Finally we got them out of the house, after the boy 
had run away four times looking for other Nazis, threatening to murder 
village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next Fu^hrer. 
Then he began to have epileptic fits. We found that a charitable 
society in New York had a long case-history of the two; and 
they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody 
else's soup.   To the Weston house came once William Allen 
Neilson, the president of Smith College who had been one of my old 
professors and who still called me "Boy" when I was sixty. It 
reminded me of my other professor, Edward Kennard Rand, of whom I 
had been so fond when I was at Harvard, the great mediaevalist and 
classical scholar who had asked me to call him "Ken", saying, "Age 
counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life <sub 
specie aeternitatis">. I had always thought of that lovable man 
as many years older than myself, although he was perhaps only twenty 
years older, and he confirmed my feeling, along with the feeling of both 
my sons, that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing. I 
must have written to say how much I had enjoyed his fine book <The 
Building 
of Eternal Rome>, and I found he had not regretted giving 
me the highest mark in his old course on the later Latin poets, although 
in my final examination I had ignored the questions and filled the 
bluebook with a comparison of Propertius and Coleridge. He had written 
to me about a dinner he had had with the Benedictine monks at St& 
Anselm's Priory in Washington. There had been reading at table, 
especially from two books, Pope Gregory the Great's account 
of St& Scholastica in his <Dialogues> and my own <The World 
of Washington Irving>. He said, "Some have criticized your book 
as 
being neither literary criticism nor history. Of course it was not 
meant to be. Some have felt that Washington Irving comes out rather 
slimly, but let them look at the title of the book". He felt as 
I felt about this best of all my books, that it was "really tops".

Two or three times, C& C& Burlingham came to lunch with 
us in Weston, that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred 
years old and whose birthplace had been my Wall Street suburb. His 
reading ranged from Agatha Christie to the Book of Job and he had 
an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures, while his letters were 
full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom 
he had been intimately thrown six decades before. I could never forget 
the gaiety with which, when he was both blind and deaf, he let me 
lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures; and once 
when he came to see us in New York he walked away in a rainstorm, 
unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella, although he was at the 
time ninety years old. There were several men of ninety or more whom 
I knew first or last, all of whom were still productive and most of 
whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex 
of their lives. I never met John Dewey, whose style was a sort 
of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to Mexico with him 
when he was investigating the cause of Trotsky; but I liked to think 
of him at ninety swimming and working at Key West long after Hemingway 
had moved to Cuba. At Lee Simonson's house, I had dined 
with Edith Hamilton, the nonogenarian rationalist and the charming scholar 
who had a great popular success with <The Greek Way>. Then 
there was Mark Howe and there was Henry Dwight Sedgwick, an accomplished 
man of letters who wrote in the spirit of Montaigne and produced 
in the end a formidable body of work. I saw Sedgwick often before 
his death at ninety-five,- he had remarried at the age of ninety,- 
and he asked me, when once I returned from Rome, if I knew the 
Cavallinis in the church of St& Cecilia in Trastevere. I had to 
confess that I had missed these frescoes, recently discovered, that 
he had studied in his eighties. Sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy 
of Epicurus whom, with his followers, Dante put in hell; but 
he defended the doctrine in <The Art of Happiness>, and what indeed 
could be said against the Epicurean virtues, health, frugality, 
privacy, culture and friendship? Of Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe 
the philosopher Whitehead said the Earth's first visitors to Mars 
should be persons likely to make a good impression, and when he was 
asked, "Whom would you send"? he replied, "My first choice 
would be Mark Howe". This friend of many years came once to visit 
us in the house at Weston. Then I spoke at the ninetieth birthday 
party of W& E& Burghardt Du Bois, who embarked on a fictional 
trilogy at eighty-nine and who, with <The Crisis>, had created a 
Negro intelligentsia that had never existed in America before him. As 
their interpreter and guide, he had broken with Tuskegee and become 
a spokesman of the coloured people of the world.   Mr& Burlingham,- 
"C&C&B&"- wrote to me once about an old friend 
of mine, S& K& Ratcliffe, whom I had first met in London in 
1914 and who also came out for a week-end in Weston. "Did you ever 
know a man with greater zest for information? And his memory, like 
an elephant's, stored with precise knowledge of men and things and 
happenings". His wife, Katie, "as gay as a lark and as lively 
as a gazelle",- she was then seventy-six,- had a "a sense of humour 
that has been denied S&K&, but neither has any aesthetic perceptions. 
People and books are enough for them". S&K& was visiting 
C&C&B& and, not waiting for breakfast, he was off to 
the University Club, where he spent hours writing obituaries of living 
Americans for the <Manchester guardian> or the <Glasgow Herald>. 
Later, rising ninety, he was beset by publishers for the story 
of his life and miracles, as he put it, but, calling himself the Needy 
Knife-grinder, he had spent his time writing short articles and long 
letters and could not get even a small popular book done. Then, all 
but blind, he said there was nothing in <Back to Methuselah>,- 
"G&B&S& ought to have known that",- and "I look at my 
bookshelves despairingly, knowing that I can have nothing more to do 
with them". However, at eighty-five, he had still been busy writing 
articles, reviewing and speaking, and I had never before known an 
Englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the United 
States. Finally, colleges and clubs took the line that speakers 
from England were not wanted any longer, even speakers like S&K&, 
so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the Americans 
for many years. With their facile generalizations about the United 
States, these mediocrities, as they often were, had been great successes. 
While S&K& did not like Dylan Thomas, I liked his poems 
very much, but I made the mistake of telling Dylan Thomas so, whereupon 
he said to me, "I suppose you think you know all about me". 
I should have replied, "I probably know something about the best 
part of you". But I only thought of that in the middle of the night.

Many years later I went to see S&K& in England, where 
he was living at Whiteleaf, near Aylesbury, and he showed me beside 
his cottage there the remains of the road on which Boadicea is supposed 
to have travelled. He was convinced that George Orwell's <1984> 
was nearly all wrong as it applied to England, which was "driving 
forward into uncharted waters", with the danger of a new tyranny 
ahead. "But however we go, whatever our doom, it will not take the 
Orwellian shape". With facts mainly in his mind, he was often acute 
in the matter of style, and he said, "The young who have as yet 
nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines. 
But put them before a situation which they are forced to depict",- 
he was speaking of the Spanish civil war,- "and they have no hesitation; 
they merely do their best to make it real for others". 
He looked at her as she spoke, then got up as she was speaking still, 
and, simply and wordlessly, walked out. And that was the end. Or nearly.

He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken. 
Would he meet him in Baltimore in Drawing Room ~A, Car Three 
on the train leaving Washington at nine o'clock next morning? 
They would go to New York together, where parties would be piled on 
weariness and on misery. But not for long. Both Alfred Harcourt and 
Donald Brace had written him enthusiastic praise of <Elmer Gantry> 
(any changes could be made in proof, which was already coming from 
the printer) and they had ordered 140,000 copies- the largest first 
printing of any book in history. But none of this could soothe the 
exacerbated nerves. On New Year's Eve, Alfred Harcourt drove 
him up the Hudson to Bill Brown's Training Camp, a well-known establishment 
for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who 
could no longer help themselves. But, in departing, Lewis begged 
Breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the Grosvenor on 
his return, and he took with him the first thirty galleys of <Elmer 
Gantry>.   On January 4, with the boys back at school and college, 
Mrs& Lewis wrote Harcourt to say that she was "thro, quite 
thro". "This whole Washington venture was my last gesture, 
and it has failed. Physically as well as mentally I have reached the 
limit of my endurance. My last gift to him is complete silence until 
the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down. For him to 
divorce God and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity. I am 
really ill at the present moment, and I will go to some sort of a sanitarium 
to normalize myself". And she withdrew then to Cromwell 
Hall, in Cromwell, Connecticut.   Harcourt replied: "I do 
really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time. Of course 
I hope Hal can also, but those hopes are much more faint".

ON JANUARY 8, 1927, he returned to the Grosvenor in high 
spirits, and looking fit. He had been, he wrote Mencken at once, "in 
the country", a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly 
changed him. Charles Breasted remembers that, before unpacking his bag, 
he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order, and almost at 
once "the familiar procession of people began milling through our living 
room at any hour between two P&M& and three A&M&". 
They were strays of every kind- university students and journalists, 
Village hangers-on and barflies, taxi drivers and editors and unknown 
poets, as well as friends like Elinor Wylie and William Rose Benet, 
the Van Dorens and Nathan, Rebecca West and Hugh Walpole 
and Osbert Sitwell, Laurence Stallings, Lewis Browne, William Seabrook, 
Arthur Hopkins, the Woodwards. When he came home from his 
office at the end of the afternoon, Breasted never knew what gathering 
he should expect to find, but there almost always was one. 
He did not neglect his wife in Cromwell Hall, but telephoned her and 
wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish 
to "stand behind" her in their separation and of his hope that there 
would be no bitterness between them. She was occupying herself in 
an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they 
had rented abroad. He was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go 
abroad when the <Gantry> galleys were finished. For a time, urging 
Breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing 
instead, he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research 
for the labor novel; if Breasted agreed, they would get a car and tour 
the country, visiting every kind of industrial center. When Breasted 
insisted that this was impossible for him, Lewis decided to go abroad.

He telephoned L& M& Birkhead and asked him and his 
wife to come to Europe as his guests, but Birkhead declined on the 
grounds that one of them must be in the United States when <Elmer 
Gantry> was published. Lewis was spending his mornings, with the 
help of two secretaries, on the galleys of that long novel, making considerable 
revisions, and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity 
exhausted him once more, so that he was compelled to spend three days 
in the Harbor Sanatorium in the last week of January. Before he 
made that retreat, he telephoned Earl Blackman in Kansas City and 
asked him to come to Europe with him. Blackman was to be in New York 
by February 2, because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning. 
Lewis told him what clothes he should bring along, and enjoined him 
not to buy anything that he did not already own, they would do that 
in New York. Blackman arrived a day or two early, and Lewis took him 
to a department store immediately and outfitted him, luggage and all, 
and then he took him to a party at the Woodwards that went on until 
four in the morning.   On the evening that they were to sail, 
Lewis himself gave a party, but he was too indisposed to appear at it. 
Woodward took occasion to warn Blackman about Lewis's drinking 
and urged him to "try to keep him sober". After a dinner party for 
which she had come down to New York, Mrs& Lewis and Casanova 
arrived to see them off, and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that 
indicated that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to 
be about the real nature of their separation. Nevertheless, Mrs& 
Lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let him do as he wished, 
let him sleep with chambermaids if he must, but, she begged Blackman, 
try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in 
good health. As they stood at the first-class rail, waving down to his 
wife and Casanova below, Lewis said, "Earl, there is Gracie's 
future husband". And when questioned by ship's reporters about 
the separation, she said, "I adore him, and he adores me". 
Blackman had brought news from Kansas City. Before his departure, 
a group of his friends, the Reverend Stidger among them, had given 
him a luncheon, and Stidger had seen advance sheets of <Elmer Gantry>. 
He was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered 
fifty technical errors in its account of church practices. L& M& 
Birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent. But his rancor 
did not cease, and presently, on March 13, when he preached a sermon 
on the text, "And Ben-hadad Was Drunk", he told his congregation 
how disappointed he was in Mr& Lewis, how he regretted having 
had him in his house, and how he should have been warned by the fact 
that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the 
book. But that sermon, like those of hundreds of other ministers, was 
yet to be delivered.   In London Lewis took the usual suite 
in Bury Street. To the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life, 
about his wish to be a newspaperman once more, about the prevalence of 
American slang in British speech, about the loquacity of the English 
and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage, about 
his plans to wander for two years "unless stopped and made to write 
another book". The <Manchester Guardian> wondered how anyone 
in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to Mr& Lewis, 
since it was well known that Mr& Lewis always did all of the talking. 
His English friends, it said, had gone into training to keep 
up with him vocally and with his "allegro movements around the luncheon 
table". The New York <Times> editorialist wondered just who 
would stop Mr& Lewis and make him write a book.   Lewis's 
remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce American 
reporters to invade the offices of Harcourt, Brace + Company for 
information, to pursue Mrs& Lewis to Cromwell Hall, and, after 
she had returned to New York, to ferret her out at the Stanhope on 
upper Fifth Avenue where she had taken an apartment. There, to the 
<Evening Post,> she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained 
that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son, 
which henceforth would be strictly American. These rumors of permanent 
separation started up a whole crop of stories about her. One had 
it that a friend, protesting her snobbery, said, "But, Gracie, 
you are an American, aren't you"? and she replied, "I was born 
in America, <but> I was <conceived> in <Vienna">. Lewis 
himself furthered these tales. He is said to have reported that once, 
when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation, 
and the friend protested that it had been "nothing", she replied, 
"Well, it was your healthy American peasant blood that pulled 
you through". With these and similar tales he was entertaining his 
English friends, all of whom he was seeing when he was not showing 
Blackman the sights of London and its environs.   At once upon 
his arrival, he telephoned Lady Sybil Colefax who invited them to 
tea, and then Lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding 
up his friends. He invited Lady Sybil, Lord Thomson, Bechhofer 
Roberts, and a half dozen others. It was a dinner party, Lewis had 
been drinking during the afternoon, and long before the party really 
got under way, he was quite drunk, with the result that the party broke 
up even before dinner was over. Lewis, at the head of the table, would 
leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks 
that, when not highly offensive, were at least highly inappropriate, 
and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed.   When 
Blackman emerged from the bedroom, everyone was gone except the tolerant 
Lord Thomson, who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour, 
and then Blackman lay awake most of that night, despairing of what he 
must expect on the Continent. Finally, at dawn, he fell asleep, and 
when he awoke and came into the living room, he found Lewis in his pajamas 
before the fire, smoking a cigarette. Blackman said that he wanted 
to apologize for not having prevented Lewis from making that horrible 
spectacle of himself, that he should have seized him by the neck 
at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom. Lewis warned him never 
to lay a hand on him, and then Blackman asked for his fare back 
to the United States. Lewis looked at him and began to cry, and then, 
saying that he was going to make a promise, he asked Blackman to call 
the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did 
not want. "And from now on, for the rest of this trip, I will only 
drink what you agree that I should drink". Blackman called the porter 
and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy, and after 
that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner, or, on one of their 
walking trips, beer, or, in France and Italy, wine in moderation.

Lewis gave him a guidebook tour of London and, motoring and 
walking, took him to Stratford, but the London stay was for only ten 
days, and on the twentieth they took the train for Southampton, where 
they spent the night for an early morning Channel crossing. Near 
Southampton, in a considerable establishment, lived Homer Vachell, 
a well-known pulp writer, and his brother, Horace- both friends of 
Lewis's. He suggested that they call on these brothers, who received 
them pleasantly. Then they returned to their hotel and got ready 
for bed. It was late, and Blackman was ready to go to sleep, but Lewis 
was not. He said, "We had a good time tonight, didn't we, Earl"? 
Earl agreed, and Lewis said that it would have been very different 
if his wife had been with him. Then he kept Blackman awake 
for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife 
and himself in which, discussing the evening, he was continually berated. 
He began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does 
not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming, 
and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries. 
From 1613 on, if the lists exist, they contain between twenty to thirty 
names. As the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was, according 
to Masson (<Life>, 1:218 and ~n), two hundred fifty-nine, 
the twenty-four names listed in the <ordo senioritatis> for that 
year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors 
who then incepted. There were four from St& John's and 
four from Christ's, three from Pembroke, and two from each of the 
colleges, Jesus, Peterhouse, Queens', and Trinity, with Caius, 
Clare, King's, Magdalene, and Sidney supplying one each in the <ordo 
senioritatis>. The list was headed by [Henry] Hutton of St& 
John's who was matriculated from St& John's at Easter, 
1625. He became a fellow of Jesus in 1629, proceeded M&A& from 
Jesus in 1632, and was proctor in 1639-40. The second name was [Edward] 
Kempe, matriculated from Queens' College at Easter, 1625. 
He proceeded M&A& in 1632, and B&D& in 1639, being made 
fellow in 1632. He was ordained deacon 16 June and priest 22 December 
1633. The third name was [John] Ravencroft, who was admitted 
to the Inner Temple in November 1631. The fourth name was [John] 
Milton of Christ's College, followed by [Richard] Manningham 
of Peterhouse, who matriculated 16 October 1624. Venn gave his B&A& 
as 1624, a mistake for 1629. Manningham also proceeded M&A& 
in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year. [John] 
Boutflower of Christ's was twelfth in the list, coming from Perse 
School under Mr& Lovering as pensioner 20 April 1625 under Mr& 
Alsop. The fourteenth name was [Richard] Buckenham, written 
Buckman, admitted to Christ's College under Scott 2 July 1625. 
The fifteenth name was [Thomas] Baldwin, admitted to Christ's 
4 March 1625 under Alsop. Christ's College was well represented 
that year in the <ordo>, and the name highest on the list from that 
college was Milton's, fourth in the entire university. Small wonder 
that Milton later boasted of how well his work had been received 
there, since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher 
than that of any other inceptor from Christ's of that year.

It is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby 
these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they 
contained assumed the order in which we find them. The process usually 
began with a tutor boasting about a boy, as Chappell had boasted about 
Lightfoot, to the higher officers of the college and university. 
Then the various officers of the college might take up the case. It 
would, however, reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the 
public-school performances of the incepting bachelors, and the place 
that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported 
himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was 
incepting. Of course the higher officials could add or place a name 
on the list wherever they wished. Milton's name being fourth is neither 
too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of 
vice-chancellor, proctor, master, or other mighty hand. He evidently 
earned the place assigned him. 

#RECAPITULATION OF MILTON'S UNDERGRADUATE 
CAREER#

Looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years 
of Milton's undergraduate days, certain phases of his college 
career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us. Of 
course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of 
education he received. It differed from what an undergraduate receives 
today from any American college or university mainly in the certainty 
of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely 
scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates. Milton 
was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge 
of Latin grammar, logic-rhetoric, ethics, physics or natural philosophy, 
metaphysics, and Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He had also 
sampled various special fields of learning, being unable to miss some 
study of divinity, Justinian (law), and Galen (medicine). Above all, 
he had learned to write formal Latin prose and verse to a remarkable 
degree of artistry. He had learned to dispute devastatingly, both formally 
and informally in Latin, and according to the rules on any topic, 
pro or con, drawn from almost any subject, more especially from Aristotle's 
works. He could produce carefully constructed orations, 
set and formal speeches, artfully and prayerfully made by writing and 
rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide, and then 
delivered verbatim from memory. He had also learned to dispute extempore 
remarkably well, the main evidence for which of course is the presence 
of his name in the honors list of 1628/29. He also displayed 
the ability to write Latin verse on almost any topic of dispute, the 
verses, of course, to be delivered from memory. Then we have surviving 
at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in <Naturam non 
Pati Senium>, and perhaps also the <De Idea Platonica>. But 
his greatest achievement, in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues 
and teachers, was his amazing ability to produce literary Latin 
pieces, and he was often called on to do so. These were his public 
academic activities, <domi forisque>, in the college and in the university. 
And his performances attracted much attention, as the frequency 
of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his 
undergraduate activities testifies.   His other activities are 
not so easily recovered. His statements about sports and exercises of 
a physical nature are suggestive, but inconclusive. His later boastings 
of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and 
practice devoted to the use of that weapon. Venn and others have dealt 
with sports and pastimes at Cambridge in Milton's day with not very 
specific results. Milton himself, uncommunicative as he is about 
his lesser and nonliterary activities, at least gives us some evidence 
that he was a great walker, under any and all conditions. His early 
poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city 
and the neighboring country that may be extended to Cambridge and its 
surrounding countryside. The town itself and the "reedy Cam" he 
often visited, as did all in the university. The churches, the taverns, 
and the various other places of the town must have known his figure 
well as he roved to and about them. The tiny hamlet of Chesterton 
to the north, with the fens and marshes lying on down the Ouse River, 
may have attracted him often, as it did many other youths of the time. 
The Gog Magog Hills to the southeast afforded him and all other 
students a vantage point from which to view the town and university 
of their dwelling. The country about Cambridge is flat and not particularly 
spectacular in its scenery, though it offers easy going to the 
foot traveler. Ball games, especially football, required some attention, 
and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant 
or spectator. He smoked, as did everybody, and imbibed the various alcoholic 
beverages of that day, although his protestations while at Cambridge 
and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence 
from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and, we 
must add, of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers.

What manner of person does Milton appear to have been 
when as an undergraduate he resided at Christ's College? He was 
then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance, medium stature, 
and handsome face. Graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had 
taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight, wiry 
frame, he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college, 
to which he himself referred in <Prolusion /6,: A quibusdam, 
audivi nuper Domina>. That is, if we can trust that most specious 
of prolusions, packed as it is with wit and persiflage. The <Domina> 
sounds real enough, if we could only trust the conditions under 
which we learn of its use; but anyone who would put much trust in any 
phase of <Prolusion /6,> except its illusive allusiveness deserves 
whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously 
stilted banter. In short, the traditional epithet for Milton of 'Lady 
of Christ's', while eminently fitting, rests only on this 
baffling passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of writing 
Milton left us. Aubrey's mention of it (2:67, and Bodleian ~MS 
Aubr& 8, f& 63) comes from this prolusion, through Christopher 
Milton or Edward Phillips. It is not a question of truth or falsity; 
the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the 
epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that 
almost nothing in it can be accepted as true- or discarded as false. 
The entire exercise, Latin and English, is most suggestive of the 
kind of person Milton had become at Christ's during his undergraduate 
career; the mere fact that he was selected, though as a substitute, 
to act as interlocutor or moderator for it, or perhaps we should say 
with Buck as 'father of the act', is in itself a difficult phase 
of his development to grasp. Milton was to act as the archfool, the 
supreme wit, the lightly bantering <pater, Pater Liber,> who could 
at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment, or could 
at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering, and 
with words alone. From an exercise involving merely raucous, rough-and-tumble 
comedy, in his hands the performance turned into a revel of 
wit and word play, indecent at times, but always learned, pointed, and 
carefully aimed at some individuals present, and at the whole assembly. 
To do this successfully required great skill and a special talent 
for both solemn and ribald raillery, a talent not bestowed on many persons, 
but one with which Milton was marked as being endowed and in which, 
at least in this performance, he obviously reveled. It may be thought 
unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform, 
if again we may trust the opening of the <oratio>, for it marks 
the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play 
that even in this Latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of 
viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an 
adversary. But the real beginnings of this development in him go back 
to the opposing of grammar school, and probably if it had not been this 
occasion and these Latin lines it would have been some others, such 
as the first prolusion, that set off this streak in him of unbridled 
and scathing verbal attack on an enemy. All western Europe would hear 
and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century.

But these prolusions that we have surviving from the Christ's 
College days are only one phase of his existence then. Perhaps 
his most important private activity was the combination of reading, 
discussion with a few- if we can trust his writings to Diodati and 
the younger Gill, very few- congenial companions. Lines 23-36 of <Lycidas> 
later point to a friendship with Edward King, who entered 
Christ's College 9 June 1626. No other names among the young men 
in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by Milton 
as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted. But that scarcely 
means that he was the aloof, forbidding type of student who shared 
few if any activities with his fellows, the banter of the surviving 
prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this. Apparently he was 
not a participant in the college or university theatricals, which he 
once attacked as utterly unworthy performances (see <Apology,> 3:300); 
but even in that famous passage, Milton was aiming not at the 
theatricals as such but at their performance by 'persons either enter'd, 
or presently to enter into the ministry'. The fact that he 
nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of 
the boys later in his hypothetical academy (1644) should not be taken 
too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances. 
Perhaps, in that short piece or letter written to Hartlib in 
which he sketched his scheme for educating young men, he merely overlooked 
that phase of their exercises. 
Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions 
that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe 
and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot. On 
the other hand, the bright vision of the future has been directly stated 
in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies- science 
fiction, of course, is related, if sometimes distantly, to that 
utopian literature optimistic about science, literature whose period 
of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
produced Edward Bellamy's <Looking Backward> and H& G& 
Wells's <A Modern Utopia>. In Arthur Clarke's <Childhood's 
End> (1953), though written after the present flood of dystopias 
began, we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly 
defined.   <Childhood's End>- apparently indebted to Kurd 
Lasswitz's utopian romance, <Auf Zwei Planeten> (1897), and 
also to Wells's histories of the future, especially <The World Set 
Free> (1914) and <The Shape of Things to Come> (1933)- 
describes 
the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords, vastly superior 
creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for 
its next stage of development, an eventual merging with the composite 
mind of the universe. Arriving just in time to stop men from turning 
their planet into a radioactive wasteland, the Overlords unite earth 
into one world in which justice, order, and benevolence prevail and 
ignorance, poverty, and fear have ceased to exist. Under their rule, 
earth becomes a technological utopia. Both abolition of war and new 
techniques of production, particularly robot factories, greatly increase 
the world's wealth, a situation described in the following passage, 
which has the true utopian ring: "Everything was so cheap that 
the necessities of life were free, provided as a public service by 
the community, as roads, water, street lighting and drainage had once 
been. A man could travel anywhere he pleased, eat whatever he fancied- 
without handing over any money". With destructive tensions and 
pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human 
life- rebuilding entire cities, expanding facilities for entertainment, 
providing unlimited opportunities for education- indeed, for 
the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the 
fullest. Mankind, as a result, attains previously undreamed of levels 
of civilization and culture, a golden age which the Overlords, a very 
evident symbol of science, have helped produce by introducing reason 
and the scientific method into human activities. Thus science is the 
savior of mankind, and in this respect <Childhood's End> only 
blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which, though not 
always so directly stated, 
has nevertheless been present in the minds 
of most science-fiction writers.   Considering then the optimism 
which has permeated science fiction for so long, what is really remarkable 
is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers 
have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future, 
have attacked the <Childhood's End> kind of faith that science 
and technology will inevitably better the human condition. And they 
have done this on a very large scale, with a veritable flood of novels 
and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure 
with dystopian elements. Because of the means of publication- science-fiction 
magazines and cheap paperbacks- and because dystopian science 
fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent 
of this phenomenon can hardly be known, though one fact is evident: 
the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations. 
Among the dystopias, for example, Isaac Asimov's <The 
Caves of Steel> (1954) portrays the deadly effects on human life 
of the super-city of the future; James Blish's <A Case of Conscience> 
(1958) describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction 
in underground shelters; Ray Bradbury's <Fahrenheit 
451> (1954) presents a book-burning society in which wall television 
and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds; Walter M& Miller, 
Jr&'s, <A Canticle for Leibowitz> (1959) finds men, after 
the great atomic disaster, stumbling back to their previous level of 
civilization and another catastrophe; Frederick Pohl's "The Midas 
Touch" (1954) predicts an economy of abundance which, in order 
to remain prosperous, must set its robots to consuming surplus production; 
Clifford D& Simak's "How-2" (1954) tells of a future 
when robots have taken over, leaving men nothing to do; and Robert 
Sheckley's <The Status Civilization> (1960) describes a world 
which, frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it, 
becomes static and conformist. A more complete list would also include 
Bradbury's "The Pedestrian" (1951), Philip K& 
Dick's 
<Solar Lottery> (1955), David Karp's <One> (1953), Wilson 
Tucker's <The Long Loud Silence> (1952), Jack Vance's 
<To Live Forever> 
(1956), Gore Vidal's <Messiah> (1954), and 
Bernard Wolfe's <Limbo> (1952), as well as the three perhaps most 
outstanding dystopias, Frederik Pohl and C& M& Kornbluth's 
<The Space Merchants> (1953), Kurt Vonnegut's <Player 
Piano> (1952), and John Wyndham's <Re-Birth> (1953), works which 
we will later examine in detail. The novels and stories like Pohl's 
<Drunkard's Walk> (1960), with the focus on adventure and 
with the dystopian elements only a dim background- in this case an 
uneasy, overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting 
routine jobs while a carefully selected, university-trained elite 
runs everything- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias.

There is, of course, nothing new about dystopias, for they belong 
to a literary tradition which, including also the closely related satiric 
utopias, stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century 
and Swift's <Gulliver's Travels> to the twentieth century 
and Zamiatin's <We,> Capek's <War with the Newts,> Huxley's 
<Brave New World,> E& M& Forster's "The Machine 
Stops", C& S& Lewis's <That Hideous Strength,> 
and Orwell's <Nineteen Eighty-Four,> and which in science fiction 
is represented 
before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy, <The 
Time Machine,> "A Story of the Days to Come", and <When 
the Sleeper Wakes,> and as recently as Jack Williamson's "With 
Folded Hands" (1947), the classic story of men replaced by their 
own robots. What makes the current phenomenon unique is that so 
many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing 
works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life. 
Since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the 
last twelve years, it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief 
impetus was the 1949 publication of <Nineteen Eighty-Four,> an assumption 
which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as 
Room 101, along with education by conditioning from <Brave New World,> 
a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned 
with new interest after reading the more powerful Orwell dystopia.

Not all recent science fiction, however, is dystopian, for the 
optimistic strain is still very much alive in <Mission of Gravity> 
and <Childhood's End,> as we have seen, as well as in many other 
recent popular novels and stories like Fred Hoyle's <The Black 
Cloud> (1957); and among works of dystopian science fiction, not 
all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature- 
but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction. 
In addition, there are many areas of the human situation besides 
the impact of science and technology which are examined, for science-fiction 
dystopias often extrapolate political, social, economic tendencies 
only indirectly related to science and technology. Nevertheless, 
with all these qualifications and exceptions, the current dystopian 
phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology, 
instead of bringing utopia, may well enslave, dehumanize, and even 
destroy men. How effectively these warnings can be presented is seen 
in Pohl and Kornbluth's <The Space Merchants,> Vonnegut's 
<Player Piano> and Wyndham's <Re-Birth>.   Easily 
the best known of these three novels is <The Space Merchants,> a 
good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more 
than the impact of science on human life, though its most important 
warning is in this area, namely as to the use to which discoveries in 
the behavioral sciences may be put. The novel, which is not merely dystopian 
but also brilliantly satiric, describes a future America where 
one-sixteenth of the population, the men who run advertising agencies 
and big corporations, control the rest of the people, the submerged 
fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers, with the government 
being no more than "a clearing house for pressures". Like 
ours, the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order 
to survive, and, like ours, it is based on the principle of "ever 
increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption". 
The consequences, of course, have been dreadful: reckless expansion 
has led to overpopulation, pollution of the earth and depletion 
of its natural resources. For example, even the most successful executive 
lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in 
the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night; soyaburgers 
have replaced meat, and wood has become so precious that it is 
saved for expensive jewelry; and the atmosphere is so befouled that 
no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs.

While <The Space Merchants> indicates, as Kingsley Amis has 
correctly observed, some of the "impending consequences of the growth 
of industrial and commercial power" and satirizes "existing habits 
in the advertising profession", its warning and analysis penetrate 
much deeper. What is wrong with advertising is not only that it is 
an "outrage, an assault on people's mental privacy" or that it 
is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains 
a coercive tendency (which is closer to the point). Rather what Kornbluth 
and Pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent 
in perfecting "a science of man and his motives". <The Space 
Merchants,> like such humanist documents as Joseph Wood Krutch's 
<The Measure of Man> and C& S& Lewis's <The Abolition 
of Man,> considers what may result from the scientific study 
of human nature. If man is actually the product of his environment 
and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which 
environment determines what people do, then someone- a someone 
probably standing outside traditional systems of values- can turn around 
and develop completely efficient means for controlling people. Thus 
we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners, 
and the controlled. And this, of course, is exactly what Madison Avenue 
has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way, with its "hidden 
persuaders" and what the space merchants accomplish with much 
greater sophistication and precision.   Pohl and Kornbluth's 
ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques 
of advertising which tie in with "every basic trauma and neurosis 
in American life", which work on the libido of consumers, which 
are linked to the "great prime motivations of the human spirit". 
As the hero, Mitchell Courtenay, explains before his conversion, 
the job of advertising is "to convince people without letting them 
know that they're being convinced". And to do this requires first 
of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the 
scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research, who, for 
example, tell Courtenay that three days is the "optimum priming period 
for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase"- 
which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send 
an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine 
it. And the second requirement for convincing people without 
their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which 
persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered. 
Thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the 
person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet, the person "capable 
of putting together words that stir and move and sing". As 
Courtenay explains, "Here in this profession we reach into the souls 
of men and women. And we do it by taking talent- and redirecting 
it".   Now the basic question to be asked in this situation 
is what motivates the manipulators, that is, what are their values?- 
since, as Courtenay says, "Nobody should play with lives the way 
we do unless he's motivated by the highest ideals". But the only 
ideal he can think of is "Sales"! Indeed, again and again, the 
space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners 
and behavioral scientists, once they have seen through human 
nature, will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide 
them.

We often say of a person that he "looks young for his age" 
or "old for his age". Yet even in the more extreme of such cases 
we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is. And 
this means, I suppose, that almost invariably age reveals itself by 
easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind. "Young 
for his age" means only the presence of some minor characteristic 
not quite usual. Stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless 
there. An assumption of youth, or the presence of a few youthful 
characteristics, deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed 
hair. "Looking young for your age" means "for your age" and 
it means no more.   A mind expressing itself in words may reveal 
itself a little less obviously as old or young. Its surface loses its 
bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious 
than the body does. Youth may be, and often is, skeptical, cynical or 
despairing; age may be idealistic, believing and much given to professions 
of optimism. But there is, nevertheless, always a subtle difference 
in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held. The 
pessimism of the young is defiant, anxious to confess or even exaggerate 
its ostensible gloom, and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that 
it regards 
its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate 
for the awfulness of that truth. Similarly the optimism of age 
protests too much. If it proclaims that the best is yet to be, it always 
arouses, at least in the young, either a suspicious question or perhaps 
the exclamation of the Negro youth who saw on a tombstone the 
inscription, "I am not dead but sleeping". "Boy, you ain't fooling 
nobody but yourself".   We may say of some unfortunates 
that they were never young. We cannot truthfully say of anyone who has 
succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old. 
Those famous lines of the Greek Anthology with which a fading beauty 
dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude: 
"Venus take my votive glass, Since I am not what I was, What 
from this day I shall be, Venus, let me never see".   No 
good can come of contemplating the sad, inevitable fact that once youth 
has passed "a worse and worse time still succeeds the former". 
But there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's <mind> 
in even a cracked mirror. One is that there sometimes are real although 
inadequate compensations in growing old. Serenity, if one is fortunate 
enough to achieve it, is not so good as joy, but it is something. 
Even to be "from hope and fear set free" is at least better than 
to have lost the first without having got rid of the second. The other 
reason (and the one with which I am here concerned) is that one thus 
becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion, or change of opinion, 
whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of 
the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all 
too obvious physical differences. One may be exasperatingly aware 
that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of 
one's own age. But at least the question has been raised. Many readers 
of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for 
the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately, even if they 
have never actually been told, what my age is. At least I should like 
them to know that I know these discounts are being made. ##

Let 
me then (and in public) glance into the mirror. I have known some 
men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember 
seem utter strangers to them now; that their remote past is as 
discontinuous with their present selves, as lacking in any conscious 
likeness to their mature personality, as the self of a butterfly may be 
imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was. For 
my part I find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs. I 
have changed and I have reversed opinions; but I am so aware of an 
uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that I see only as absurd 
the tendency of some psychologists from Heraclitus to Pirandello 
and Proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which 
nothing remains unchanged. So far as I am concerned, the child is 
unmistakably father to the man, despite the obvious fact that child and 
father differ greatly- sometimes for the better and sometimes for 
the worse.   Fundamental values, temperament and the way in which 
one approaches a conviction change less, of course, than specific opinions. 
That fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many 
present-day intellectuals who were Communists or near-Communists in 
their youth and are now so extremely conservative (or reactionary, as 
many would say) that they can define no important political conviction 
that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make 
the distinction between Mr& Nixon and Mr& Khrushchev for them 
hardly worth noting. But in ways more fundamental than specific political 
opinions they are still what they always were: passionate, sure 
without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of, capable 
of seeing black and white only and, therefore, committed to the 
logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to.

To those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally, or 
politically, or sociologically antiquated (and I have reason to know 
that there are some such), I would like to say what I have already 
hinted, namely, that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some 
discount on the simple ground that I am no longer young and therefore 
incapable of being youthful of mind. But I will also remind them that 
I have always been inclined to skepticism, to a kind of Laodicean 
lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned; so that, 
although not as eager as I once was to be disapproved of, I can still 
resist prevailing opinions.   At about the age of twelve I became 
a Spencerian liberal, and I have always considered myself a liberal 
of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since 
Spencer became a reactionary. Several times in my youth I voted 
the Socialist ticket, but less because I was Socialist than because 
I was not either a Republican or a Democrat, and I voted for 
Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate. Yet during the years 
when I was on the staff of the <Nation,> I tried to the limit 
the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when I was permitted 
to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social 
question.   Never once during the trying thirties did I come so 
close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant Russian 
communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums "an interesting 
experiment". There are few things of which I am prouder than 
of that unblemished record. Many of my friends at the time thought that 
I had received a well-deserved condemnation when Lincoln Steffens 
denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of 
the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead 
past. But he, as I can now retort, was the man who could see so 
short a distance ahead that after a visit to Russia he gave voice to 
the famous exclamation: "I have seen the future and it works".

The favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval 
of communism is that they did not know how things would develop. With 
this excuse I have never been much impressed. There was, it seems 
to me, enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of Russian 
leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait 
to see how it would turn out.   Once many years ago I sat at dinner 
next to Arthur Train, and the subject of the <Nation> came 
up. He asked me suddenly, "What are <your> political opinions"? 
"Well", I replied, "some of my colleagues on the paper regard 
me as a rank reactionary". After a moment's thought he replied, 
"That still leaves you a lot of latitude". And I suppose it 
did.   I never have been, and am not now, any kind of utopian. When 
I first came across Samuel Johnson's pronouncement, "the remedy 
for the ills of life is palliative rather than radical", it seemed 
to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths. It 
will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any 
other phrase or principle could. ##

Why did I choose to fill these 
pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous 
reflections and autobiography? The reason is, I think, my awareness 
that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm 
the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets 
us nowhere, and that I am simply too old to hope. I would, however, 
like to suggest that, wrong though I may be, the tendency to see 
dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which I have been a victim ever 
since I can remember, and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon. 
I know that one must act. But one need not always be sure that the 
action is either wise or conclusive.   Apropos of what some would 
call cynicism, I remember an anecdote the source of which I forget. 
It concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object 
lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside 
his church door. Not only his parishioners, but the whole town and, 
ultimately, the whole county were enormously impressed by this object 
lesson. One day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators 
who wanted to know his secret. "How on earth do you manage it? 
What is the trick"? "Why", he replied, "it is perfectly simple; 
there is no trick involved. All you have to do is put in a fresh 
lamb from time to time". Cynical? Blasphemous? Not really, 
it seems to me. The promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down 
together was given in the future tense. It is not something that can 
be expected to happen now. ##

Without really changing the general 
subject, I take this opportunity to confess that I am troubled by 
doubts, not only about pacifism, but also when asked to join in the protest 
against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane 
and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous; namely, the law 
that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no 
extenuating circumstances. It is not that I am unaware of the force 
of their strongest contention. Life, they say, should be regarded as 
sacred and, therefore, as something that neither an individual nor his 
society has a right to take away. In fact I cannot imagine myself 
condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if I had to take, 
as an individual, the responsibility for his death. Just as I know 
I would make a bad soldier even though I cannot sincerely call myself 
a pacifist, so too I would not be either a hangman by profession or, 
if I could avoid it, even a member of a hanging jury. Despite these 
facts the question "Should no murderer ever be executed"? seems 
to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a 
simple negative answer.   Punishment of the wrongdoer, so liberals 
are inclined to say, can have only three possible justifications: 
revenge, reformation or deterrent example. 
For here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to 
counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to 
the tarnished image of the species Man, or, as Malraux himself puts 
it, "to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves".

Andre Malraux's <The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> 
was written in the early years of the second World War, during 
a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the Germans 
after the fall of France. The manuscript, presumably after being 
smuggled out of the country, was published in Switzerland in 1943. 
The work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that 
time- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called 
<La Lutte avec l'Ange;> and this first section was somehow preserved 
(there are always these annoying little mysteries about the actual 
facts of Malraux's life) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest. 
If we are to believe the list of titles printed in Malraux's latest 
book, <La Metamorphose des Dieux,> Vol& /1, (1957), he is 
still 
engaged in writing a large novel under his original title. But as he 
remarks in his preface to <The Walnut Trees,> "a novel can hardly 
ever be rewritten", and "when this one appears in its final form, 
the form of the first part **h will no doubt be radically changed". 
Malraux pretends, perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty, 
that his fragmentary work will accordingly "appeal only to the 
curiosity of bibliophiles" 
and "to connoisseurs of what might have 
been". Even in its present form, however, the first part of Malraux's 
unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth 
century literature; and it should be far better known than it is.

The theme of <The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> is most closely 
related to its immediate predecessor in Malraux's array of novels: 
<Man's Hope> (1937). This magnificent but greatly underestimated 
book, which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time 
as no other comparable creation, has suffered severely from having 
been written about an historical event- the Spanish Civil War- 
that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political 
feuds. Even so apparently impartial a critic as W& H& Frohock 
has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece 
of Loyalist propaganda; and has then gone on to argue, with unimpeachable 
consistency, that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects 
of the book are simply inadvertent "contradictions".   Nothing, 
however, could be farther from the truth. The whole purpose of 
<Man's Hope> is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and 
ends inherent in all organized political violence- and even when such 
violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty, justice 
and human dignity. Nowhere before in Malraux's pages have we 
met such impassioned defenders of a "quality of man" which transcends 
the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether- 
both the action of Malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like Perken 
and Garine, and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated Communists 
like Kyo Gisors and Katow in <Man's Fate>. "Man engages 
only a small part of himself in an action" says old Alvear the art-historian; 
"and the more the action claims to be total, the smaller 
is the part of man engaged". These lines never cease to haunt 
the book amidst all the exaltations of combat, and to make an appeal for 
a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal 
necessities of war.   It is this larger theme of the "quality 
of man", a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into 
"the human", which now forms the pulsating heart of Malraux's 
artistic universe. Malraux, to be sure, does not abandon the world 
of violence, combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as 
a creative artist, and which is the only world, apparently, in which 
his imagination can flame into life. <The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> 
includes not one war but two, and throws in a Turkish revolution 
along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure. But 
while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that Malraux wishes 
to express, these values are no longer linked with the triumph or 
defeat of any cause- whether that of an individual assertion of the 
will-to-power, or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation 
of oppression- as their necessary condition. On the contrary, the 
frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the 
sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance 
of a Caravaggio. #/2,#

<The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> 
is composed in the form of a triptych, with the two small side panels 
framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel. This 
central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period 
from the beginning of the present century up to the first World War. 
The framing scenes, on the other hand, both take place in the late 
Spring of 1940, just at the moment of the defeat of France in the 
second great world conflict. The narrator is an Alsatian serving with 
the French Army, and he has the same name (Berger) that Malraux 
himself was later to use in the Resistance; like Malraux he was also 
serving in the tank corps before being captured, and we learn as well 
that in civilian life he had been a writer. These biographical analogies 
are obvious, and far too much time has been spent speculating 
on their possible implications.   Much more important is to grasp 
the feelings of the narrator (whose full name is never given) as he 
becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of French prisoners 
clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral 
of Chartres. For as his companions gradually dissolve back 
into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity, as they 
lose all the appanage of their acquired culture, he is overcome by 
the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind. 
"As a writer, by what have I been obsessed these last ten 
years, if not by mankind? Here I am face to face with the primeval 
stuff".   The intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening 
pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of 
the text; and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been 
done. What does the narrator see and what does he feel? A good many 
pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged 
determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families- 
even when it becomes clear that the Germans are simply allowing 
the letters to blow away in the wind. Awkwardly and laboriously, in stiff, 
unemotional phrases, the soldiers continue to bridge the distance 
between themselves and those they love; they instinctively struggle 
to keep open a road to the future in their hearts. And by a skillful 
and unobtrusive use of imagery (the enclosure is called a "Roman-camp 
stockade", the hastily erected lean-to is a "Babylonian hovel", 
the men begin to look like "Peruvian mummies" and to acquire 
"Gothic faces"), Malraux projects a fresco of human endurance- 
which is also the endurance of the human- stretching backward into 
the dark abyss of time. The narrator feels himself catching a glimpse 
of pre-history, learning of man's "age-old familiarity with misfortune", 
as well as his "equally age-old ingenuity, his secret 
faith in endurance, however crammed with catastrophes, the same faith 
perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine". 
This new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied 
by a re-vision of his previous view. "I thought I knew more than 
my education had taught me" notes the narrator, "because I had encountered 
the militant mobs of a political or religious faith". Is 
this not Malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with 
the ideological? But now he knows "that an intellectual is not only 
a man to whom books are necessary, he is any man whose reasoning, 
however elementary it may be, affects and directs his life". From this 
point of view the "militant mobs" of the past, stirred into action 
by one ideology or another, were all composed of "intellectuals"- 
and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be 
discovered. The men around him, observes the narrator, "have been 
living from day to day for thousands of years". The human is deeper 
than a mass ideology, certainly deeper than the isolated individual; 
and the narrator recalls the words of his father, Vincent Berger: 
"It is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one 
finally comes down to mankind".   The entire middle section 
of <The Walnut Trees> is taken up with the life of Vincent Berger 
himself, whose fragmentary notes on his "encounters with mankind" 
are now conveyed by his son. "He was not much older than myself" 
writes the narrator, "when he began to feel the impact of that human 
mystery which now obsesses me, and which makes me begin, perhaps, 
to understand him". For the figure of Vincent Berger Malraux has 
obviously drawn on his studies of T& E& Lawrence (though Berger 
fights on the side of the Turks instead of against them), and like 
both Lawrence and Malraux himself he is a fervent admirer of Nietzsche. 
A professor at the University of Constantinople, where his first 
course of lectures was on Nietzsche and the "philosophy of action", 
Vincent Berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the 
German Embassy in Turkey. As an Alsatian before the first World 
War he was of course of German nationality; but he quickly involves 
himself in the Young Turk revolutionary movement to such an extent 
that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism. And, after becoming 
the right-hand man of Enver Pasha, he is sent by the latter 
to pave the way for a new Turkish Empire embracing "the union of all 
Turks throughout Central Asia from Adrianople to the Chinese oases 
on the Silk Trade Route".   Vincent Berger's mission 
is a failure because the Ottoman nationalism on which Enver Pasha 
counted does not exist. Central Asia is sunk in a somnolence from which 
nothing can awaken it; and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing 
human any longer seemed to survive, Vincent Berger begins to dream 
of the Occident. "Oh for the green of Europe! Trains whistling 
in the night, the rattle and clatter of cabs **h". Finally, after 
almost being beaten to death by a madman- he could not fight back 
because madmen are sacred to Islam- he throws up his mission and 
returns to Europe. This has been his first encounter with mankind, and, 
although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular European 
press, it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied. Despite Berger's 
report, Enver Pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a Turkish Blood 
Alliance; and Vincent Berger learns that political ambition 
is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men. But as he discovers 
shortly, on returning among intellectuals obsessed by <le culte 
du moi,> his experience of action had also taught him a more positive 
lesson. "For six years my father had had to do too much commanding 
and convincing" writes the narrator, "not to understand that man 
begins with 'the other'".   And when Vincent Berger returns 
to Europe, this first result of his encounters with mankind is 
considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation. For a dawning 
sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which, 
as so often in Malraux, suddenly confront a character with the existential 
question of the nature and value of human life. One such event 
is the landing in Europe itself, when the mingled familiarity and strangeness 
of the Occident, after the blank immensities of Asia, shocks 
the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite <possibilities> 
of human life. 
In a pessimistic assessment of the cold war, Eden declared: "There 
must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective 
negotiation with the East". Ordinary methods of diplomacy within 
the free world are inadequate, said the former Prime Minister. 
"Something much more thorough is required". Citing the experience 
of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War /2,, Eden said 
that all would have been confusion and disarray without them. "This", 
he said, "is exactly what has been happening between the politically 
free nations in the postwar world. We need joint chiefs of a political 
general staff". Citing the advances of Communist power in 
recent years, Sir Anthony observed: "This very grave state of 
affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality 
of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources 
to meet it".   While I fully agree with Sir Anthony's 
contention, I think that we must carry the analysis farther, bearing 
in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our <need>, 
the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the 
measure of our <capacity>.   While it is hazardous to project 
the trend of history, it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully 
emerging in the Western world, particularly among the countries 
of Western Europe. At the end of World War /2,, free Europe was 
ready for a new beginning. The excesses of nationalism had brought 
down upon Europe a generation of tyranny and war, and a return to the 
old order of things seemed unthinkable. Under these conditions a new 
generation of Europeans began to discover the bonds of long association 
and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist 
xenophobia. A slow and painful trend toward unification has taken 
hold, a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which 
may also lead to a binding federation of Europe. It may well be 
that the unification of Europe will prove inadequate, that the survival 
of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of 
the entire Western world.   The movement toward European unity 
has been expressed in two currents: federalism and functionalism, 
one looking to the constitution of a United States of Europe, the 
other building on wartime precedents of practical coo^peration for the 
solution of specific problems. Thus far the advances made have been 
almost entirely along functional lines.   Many factors contributed 
to the growth of the European movement. In 1946 Sir Winston Churchill, 
who had spoken often of European union during the war, advocated 
the formation of "a kind of United States of Europe". Had 
Churchill been returned to office in 1945, it is just possible that 
Britain, instead of standing fearfully aloof, would have <led> Europe 
toward union.   In 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive 
coo^rdinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation 
of the Organization for European Economic Coo^peration to supervise 
and coo^rdinate the uses of American aid under the Marshall 
Plan. The United States might well have exploited the opportunity 
provided by the European Recovery Program to push the hesitant European 
nations toward political federation as well as economic coo^peration, 
but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the United 
States Government at the time.   Another powerful factor in 
the European movement was the threat of Soviet aggression. The Communist 
coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately by the 
conclusion of the Brussels Treaty, a 50-year alliance among Britain, 
France and the Benelux countries. And of course the Soviet threat 
was responsible for ~NATO, the grand alliance of the Atlantic 
nations.   New organs of unification proliferated in the decade 
following the conclusion of the ~NATO alliance. In 1949 the Council 
of Europe came into existence, a purely consultative parliamentary 
body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity. 
In 1952, the European Coal and Steel Community was launched, 
placing the coal and steel production of France, West Germany, Italy 
and Benelux under a supranational High Authority. For a time it 
appeared that a common European army might be created, but the project 
for a European Defense Community was rejected by the French National 
Assembly in 1954. In 1957 the social-economic approach to European 
integration was capped by the formation among "the Six" of 
a tariff-free European Common Market, and Euratom for coo^peration 
in the development of atomic energy.   The "overseas" democracies 
have generally encouraged the European unification movement 
without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation 
in a broader Atlantic community. The United States and Canada 
belong only to ~NATO and the new O&E&C&D&. Britain 
until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of 
the groom at a shotgun wedding. In other areas it held back, pleading 
its Commonwealth bonds. Now Britain has decided to seek admission 
to the European Economic Community and it seems certain that she will 
be joined by some of her partners in the loose Free Trade Area 
of the "Outer Seven". Besides its historical significance as a 
break with the centuries-old tradition of British insularity, Britain's 
move, if successful, will constitute an historic landmark of the 
first importance in the movement toward the unification of Europe and 
the Western world.   If a broader Atlantic community is to 
be formed- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both 
our needs and our capacity- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand 
in the ~NATO alliance. The time is now ripe, indeed overdue, 
for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities, for 
its development as an instrument of Atlantic community. What is required 
is the full implementation of Article 2 of the Treaty, which 
provides: "The Parties will contribute toward the further development 
of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening 
their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of 
the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting 
conditions of stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate 
conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage 
economic collaboration between any and all of them". As Lester 
Pearson wrote in 1955: "~NATO cannot live on fear alone. It 
cannot become the source of a real Atlantic community if it remains 
organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought 
it into being".   The problem of ~NATO is not one of machinery, 
of which there is an abundance, but of the will to use it. The 
~NATO Council is available as an executive agency, the Standing 
Group as a high military authority. The unofficial Conference of 
Parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority. 
This machinery will not become the instrument of an Atlantic community 
by fiat, but only when that community evolves from potentiality to 
reality. The existence of a community is a state of mind- a conviction 
that goals and values are widely shared, that effective communication 
is possible, that mutual trust is reasonably assured.   An 
equally promising avenue toward Atlantic community may lie through the 
development and expansion of the O&E&C&D& Conceived as 
an organ of economic coo^peration, there is no reason why O&E&C&D& 
cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members 
so desire. Indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than ~NATO 
for the development of a parliamentary organ of the Atlantic 
nations, because it could encompass <all> of the members of the Atlantic 
community including those, like Sweden and Switzerland, who 
are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like 
~NATO.   Underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a 
conviction that the nations of the North Atlantic area do indeed form 
a community, at least a potential community. There is nothing new 
in this; what is new and compelling is that the West is now but one 
of several powerful civilizations, or "systems", and that one or 
more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the West. For centuries 
the North Atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they 
did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other. That time 
is now past and the Atlantic nations, if they are to survive, must develop 
a full-fledged community, and they must also look beyond the frontiers 
of "Western civilization" toward a world-wide "concert of 
free nations". #/6,#

The burden of these reflections is that 
a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs. 
And if we do not aspire to too much, it is also within our capacity. 
A realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization 
on the one hand, and our capacity to achieve them on the other, 
must be approached through the concept of "community". History 
has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on 
the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external 
danger ceases to be dramatically urgent. Only when a concert of 
nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values 
is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy. It follows 
that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is 
only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation 
and coo^rdination. It is very much a matter of building 
the foundations of community.   It is for these reasons that proposals 
for a "new world order", through radical overhaul of the United 
Nations or through some sort of world federation, are utterly 
fatuous. In a recent book called "World Peace Through World Law", 
two distinguished lawyers, Grenville Clark and Louis Sohn, call 
for just such an overhaul of the U&N&, basing their case on 
the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust. I believe that these proposals, 
however meritorious in terms of world needs, go far beyond our 
capacity to realize them. Such proposals look to an apocalyptic act, 
a kind of Lockian "social contract" on a world-wide scale. The 
defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their 
assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible.

A working concept of the organic evolution of community 
must lead us in a different direction. The failures of the U&N& 
and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond 
what was internationally feasible. Our problem, therefore, is to 
devise processes more modest in their aspirations, adjusted to the real 
world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities. 
The history of the U&N& demonstrates that in a pluralistic 
world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than 
coercion. It is possible that international organization will ultimately 
supplant the multi-state system, but its proper function for the 
immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to 
render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world. 
New machinery of coo^rdination should not be our primary objective 
in 
the foreseeable future- though perhaps the "political general staff" 
of Western leaders proposed by Sir Anthony Eden would serve 
a useful purpose. Generally, however, there is an abundance of available 
machinery of coo^rdination- in ~NATO, in O&E&C&D&, 
in the U&N& and elsewhere. The trouble with this machinery 
is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence 
of a conscious sense of community among the free nations.

Our proper objective, then, is the development of a new spirit, the 
realization of a potential community. A "concert of free nations" 
should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century 
Concert of Europe with its common values and accepted "rules 
of the game". Constitutions of and by themselves mean little; the 
history of both the League of Nations and the United Nations demonstrates 
that. But a powerful sense of community, even with little 
or no machinery, means a great deal. That is the lesson of the nineteenth 
century.   A realistic "concert of free nations" might 
be expected to consist of an "inner community" of the North Atlantic 
nations and an "outer community" embracing much or all of the 
non-Communist world.

THE recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement 
seen by some as part of the "San Francisco Renaissance" have 
been as popular as they are notorious. "It might well start a craze 
like swallowing goldfish or pee wee golf", wrote Kenneth Rexroth 
in an explanatory note in the <Evergreen Review>, and he may have 
been right.   Under the general heading "poetry-and-jazz" widely 
divergent experiments have been carried out. Lawrence Ferlenghetti 
and Bruce Lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry 
for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical 
forms of jazz, and the vocabulary of the musician. Even musicians themselves 
have taken to writing poetry. (Judy Tristano now has poems 
as well as ballads written for her.)   But the best known exploiters 
of the new medium are Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen. Rexroth 
and Patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments. 
Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff, a name-dropper of jazz heroes, 
and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz. In San Francisco 
he has worked with Brew Moore, Charlie Mingus, and other 
"swinging" musicians of secure reputation, thus placing himself within 
established jazz traditions, in addition to being a part of the 
San Francisco "School".   Although Patchen has given previous 
evidence of an interest in jazz, the musical group that he works 
with, the Chamber Jazz Sextet, is often ignored by jazz critics. (<Downbeat> 
did not mention the Los Angeles appearance of Patchen 
and the Sextet, although the engagement lasted over two months.) The 
stated goal of the ~CJS is the synthesis of jazz and "serious" 
music. Patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles, 
and Patchen himself has remained outside the San Francisco poetry 
group, maintaining a self-imposed isolation, even though his conversion 
to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first 
appear. He had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951, and 
his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with 
the form and presentation of his poetry. However, his subject matter 
and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent, and these, together 
with certain key poetic images, may be traced through all his 
work, including the new jazz experiments.   From the beginning of 
his career, Patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry. 
His first book, <Before the Brave> (1936), is a collection 
of poems that are almost all Communistic, but after publication of this 
book he rejected 
Communism, and advocated a pacifistic anarchy, though 
retaining his revolutionary idiom. He spoke for a "proletariat" 
that included "all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth". Patchen 
believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and 
money-hungry people. Running counter to the destroying forces in the 
world are all the virtues that are innate in man, the capacity for love 
and brotherhood, the ability to appreciate beauty. Beauty as well 
as love is redemptive, and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation. 
This salvation does not take the form of a Christian Heaven. In 
Patchen's eyes, organized churches are as odious as organized governments, 
and Christian symbols, having been taken over by the moneyed 
classes, are now agents of corruption. Patchen envisions a Dark Kingdom 
which "stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger 
from his own kind". The Dark Kingdom sends Angels of Death 
and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness. Actually 
Heaven and the Dark Kingdom overlap; they form two aspects of 
heavenly life after death.   Patchen has almost never used strict 
poetic forms; he has experimented instead with personal myth-making. 
Much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a "pseudo-anthropological" 
myth reference, which is concerned with imaginary places 
and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language.

These early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying 
to Patchen. Beginning in <Cloth of the Tempest> (1943) he experimented 
in merging poetry and visual art, using drawings to carry long 
narrative segments of a story, as in <Sleepers Awake>, and constructing 
elaborate "poems-in-drawing-and-type" in which it is impossible 
to distinguish between 
the "art" and the poetry. Art "makings" 
or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of Patchen's requirements 
for a poetic frame of reference. Many of his poems purported 
to be exactly contemporary and political; so during the period approximately 
from 1941 to 1946, Patchen often used private detective stories 
as a myth reference, and the "private eye" as a myth hero. Speaking 
in terms of sociological stereotype, the "private eye" might 
appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons. The private 
detective (at least in the minds of listeners and readers all over 
the country) is an individual hero fighting injustice. He is usually 
something of an underdog, he must battle the organized police force as 
well as recognized criminals. The private detective must rely, as the 
Youngest Son or Trickster Hero does in primitive myth, on his wits. 
The private detective is militant against injustice, a humorous 
and ironic explorer of the underworld; most important to Patchen, he 
was a non-literary hero, and very contemporary. In 1945, probably almost 
every American not only knew who Sam Spade was, but had some 
kind of emotional feeling about him. In <The Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer> 
(1945) Patchen exploited this national sentiment by making 
his hero, Albert Budd, a private detective.   But since 1945, 
Sam Spade has undergone a metamorphosis; he has become Friday 
on <Dragnet>, a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority. He has, 
like so many other secular and religious culture symbols, gone over to 
the side of the ruling classes. Obviously, the "private eye" can 
have no more appeal for Patchen. To fill the job of contemporary hero 
in 1955, Patchen needed someone else.   It was logical that 
he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician. The revolution 
in jazz that took place around 1949, the evolution from the "bebop" 
school of Dizzy Gillespie to the "cool" sound of Miles 
Davis and Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz, and the whole legend of 
Charlie Parker, had made an impression on many academic and literary 
men. The differentiation between the East Coast and West Coast schools 
of jazz, the differences between the "hard bop" school of Rollins, 
and the "cerebral" experiments of Tristano, Konitz and 
Marsh, the general differences in the mores of white and negro musicians, 
all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public. 
The immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger 
generation must have impressed him, and he began working toward the 
merger of jazz and poetry, as he had previously attempted the union 
of graphic art and poetry. In addition to his experiments in reading 
poetry to jazz, Patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern 
jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the 
private detective a decade ago. In this respect, his approach to poetry-and-jazz 
is in marked contrast to Kenneth Rexroth's. Rexroth 
uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz, including many of 
his Chinese and Japanese translations; he usually draws some kind 
of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading- 
for instance, he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an Oriental 
courtesan waiting for the man she loves, and who never comes, 
and the old blues chants of Ma Rainy and other Negro singers- but 
usually the comparison is specious. Rexroth may sometimes achieve an 
effective juxtaposition, but he rarely makes any effort to capture any 
jazz "feeling" in the text of his poems, relying on his very competent 
musicians to supply this feeling.   Patchen does read some 
of his earlier works to music, but he has written an entire book of 
short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz. 
These new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians, 
but they show changes in Patchen's approach to his poetry, 
for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude 
of the jazz musician.   It is difficult to draw the line between 
stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician. Everyone knows that 
private detectives in real life are not like Sam Spade and Pat Novak, 
but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked. Seen 
by the public, the musician is the underdog <par excellence>. He 
is forced to play for little money, and must often take another job to 
live. His approach to music is highly individualistic; the accent 
is on improvisation rather than arrangements. While he is worldly, the 
musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment 
and naivete. The musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal; he 
is far from being a literary hero, yet is a creative artist. Many of 
these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective, 
but where the detective is active and militant, the jazz musician 
is passive, almost a victim of society. In order to write with authority 
either about musicians, or as a musician, Patchen would have to soft 
pedal his characteristically outspoken anger, and change (at least 
for the purposes of this poetry) from a revolutionary to a victim. He 
must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world, but 
who declines doing anything about it.   This involves a shift in 
Patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz 
poetry. He has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest 
symbols and devices to the new work, and the fact that he has kept a 
body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected 
continuity to his poetry. Perhaps tracing some of these more important 
symbols through the body of his work will show that Patchen's 
new poetry is well thought out, and remains within the mainstream 
of his work, while being suited to a new form.   Henry Miller characterized 
Patchen as a "man of anger and light". His revolutionary 
anger is apparent in most of his early poems. The following passage 
from "The Hangman's Great Hands" illustrates the directness 
of this anger. "Anger won't help. I was born angry. Angry 
that my father was being burnt alive in the mills; Angry that none 
of us knew anything but filth and poverty. Angry because I was that 
very one somebody was supposed To be fighting for".   This 
angry and exasperated stance which Patchen has maintained in his poetry 
for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind 
of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval 
of the modern world. In his recent book, <Hurray for Anything> 
(1957), one of the most important short poems- and it is the title 
poem for one of the long jazz arrangements- is written for recital 
with jazz. Although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues 
to be sung, the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling. "I 
WENT TO THE CITY And there I did Weep, Men a-crowing likes asses, 
And living like sheep. <Oh, can't hold the han' of my love! 
Can't hold her little white han!> Yes, I went to the city, And 
there I did bitterly cry, Men out of touch with the earth, And 
with never a glance at the sky. <Oh, can't hold the han' of my love! 
Can't hold her pure little han'!>" Patchen is still 
the rebel, but he writes in a doleful, mournful tone. Neither of these 
poems is an aberration; each is so typical that it represents a prominent 
trend in the poet's development.   Patchen is repeatedly 
preoccupied with death. In many of his poems, death comes by train: 
a strongly evocative visual image. Perhaps Patchen was once involved 
in a train accident, and this passage from <First Will and Testament> 
may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he 
first saw it- if he did: "  Lord love us, look at all the 
disconnected limbs floating hereabouts, like bloody feathers at that- 
and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the 
tongue are in all the cheek **h".

Let us see just how typical Krim is. He is New York-born 
and Jewish. He spent one year at the University of North Carolina 
because Thomas Wolfe went there. He returned to New York to work 
for <The New Yorker,> to edit a Western pulp, to "duck the war 
in the ~OWI", to write publicity for Paramount Pictures and 
commentary for a newsreel, then he began his career as critic for various 
magazines. Now he has abandoned all that to be A Writer. I do 
not want to quibble about typicality; in a certain sense, one manner 
of experience will be typical of any given group while another will 
not. 
But I've got news for Krim: he's not typical, he's pretty special. 
His may typify a certain kind of postwar New York experience, 
but his experience is certainly not typical of his "generation's". 
In any case, who ever thought that New York is typical of anything?

Men of Krim's age, aspirations, and level of sophistication 
were typically involved in politics before the war. They did 
not "duck the war" but they fought in it, however reluctantly; 
they sweated out some kind of formal education; they read widely and 
eclectically; 
they did not fall into pseudo-glamorous jobs on pseudo-glamorous 
magazines, but they did whatever nasty thing they could get 
in order to eat; they found out who they were and what they could do, 
then within the limits of their talent they did it. They did not worry 
about "experience", because experience thrust itself upon them. 
And they traveled out of New York. Only a native New Yorker could 
believe that New York is now or ever was a literary center. It 
is a publishing and public relations center, but these very facts prevent 
it from being a literary center because writers dislike provincialism 
and untruth. Krim's typicality consists only in his New Yorker's 
view that New York is the world; he displays what outlanders 
call the New York mind, a state that the subject is necessarily unable 
to perceive in himself. The New York mind is two parts abstraction 
and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact 
the world. In his fulminating against the literary world, Krim is 
really struggling with the New Yorker in himself, but it's a losing 
battle.   Closely related to his illusions about his typicality 
is Krim's complicated feeling about his Jewishness. He writes, 
"Most of my friends and I were Jewish; we were also literary; 
the combination of the Jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility 
needed to be a writer created in my circle the most potent and 
incredible intellectual-literary ambition I have ever seen or could ever 
have imagined. Within themselves, just as people, my friends were 
often tortured and unappeasably bitter about being the offspring of this 
unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed; their reading and thinking 
gave 
an extension to their normal blushes about appearing 'Jewish' 
in subway, bus, racetrack, movie house, any of the public places that 
used to make the Jew of my generation self-conscious (heavy thinkers 
walking across Seventh Avenue without their glasses on, willing to 
dare the trucks as long as they didn't look like the ikey-kikey caricature 
of the Yiddish intellectual) **h". At other points in his 
narrative, Krim associates Jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition, 
with abstraction, with his personal turning aside from the good, 
the true, and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of James T& 
Farrell to the international, the false, and the inflated. 
Krim says, in short, that he is a suffering Jew. The only possible 
answer to that is, I am a suffering Franco-Irishman. We all love 
to suffer, but some of us love to suffer more than others. Had Krim 
gone 
farther from New York than Chapel Hill, he might have discovered 
that large numbers of American Jews do not find his New York version 
of the Jews' lot remotely recognizable. More important is the 
simple human point that all men suffer, and that it is a kind of 
anthropological-religious 
pride on the part of the Jew to believe that his suffering 
is more poignant than mine or anyone else's. This is not to 
deny the existence of pogroms and ghettos, but only to assert that these 
horrors 
have had an effect on the nerves of people who did not experience 
them, that among the various side effects is the local hysteria 
of Jewish writers and intellectuals who cry out from confusion, which 
they call oppression and pain. In their stupidity and arrogance they 
believe they are called upon to remind the gentile continually of pogroms 
and ghettos. Some of us have imagination and sensibility too. 
Finally, there is the undeniable fact that some of the finest American 
fiction is being written by Jews, but it is not <Jewish> fiction; 
Saul Bellow and Bernard Malamud, through intellectual toughness, 
perception, through experience in fact, have obviously liberated 
themselves from any sentimental Krim self-indulgence they might have 
been tempted to.   Krim's main attack is upon the aesthetic and 
the publishing apparatus of American literary culture in our day. 
Krim was able to get an advance for a novel, and time and opportunity 
to write at Yaddo, but it was no good. "I had natural sock", he 
says, 'as a storyteller and was precociously good at description, dialogue, 
and most of the other staples of the fiction-writer's trade 
but I was bugged by a mammoth complex of thoughts and feelings that 
prevented me from doing more than just diddling the surface of sustained 
fiction-writing". And again, "how can you write when you haven't 
yet read 'Bartleby the Scrivener'"? Krim came to believe 
that "the novel as a form had outlived its vital meaning". His 
"articulate Jewish friends" convinced him that education (read "reading") 
was "a must". He moved in a "highly intellectual" 
group in Greenwich Village in the late forties, becoming "internationalized" 
overnight. Then followed a period in which he wrote reviews 
for <The New York Times Book Review, The Commonweal, Commentary,> 
had a small piece in <Partisan Review,> and moved on 
to <Hudson, The Village Voice,> and <Exodus>. The work for 
<Commonweal> 
was more satisfying than work for <Commentary> "because 
of the staff's tiptoeing fear of making a booboo". <Commentary> 
was a mere suburb of <Partisan Review,> the arch-enemy. Both 
magazines were "rigid with <reactionary> what-will-T& S& Eliot-or-Martin 
Buber-think? fear **h". <Partisan> has failed, 
Krim says, for being "snob-clannish, overcerebral, Europeanish, aristocratically 
alienated" from the U&S&. It was "the creation 
of a monstrous historical period wherein it thought it had to synthesize 
literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with 
its writers crazily trying to outdo each other in Spenglerian inclusiveness 
**h". <Kenyon, Sewanee,> and <Hudson> operated in an "Anglo-Protestant 
New Critical chill"; their example caused Krim 
and his friends to put on "Englishy airs, affect all sorts of 
impressive 
scholarship and social-register unnaturalness **h in order to 
slip through their narrow transoms and get into their pages". <Qui 
s'excuse s'accuse,> as the French Jewish intellectuals used 
to say.   Through all this raving, Krim is performing a traditional 
and by now boring rite, the attack on intelligence, upon the largely 
successful attempt of the magazines he castigates to liberate American 
writing from local color and other varieties of romantic corn. God 
knows that <Partisan> and the rest often were, and remain, guilty 
of intellectual flatulence. Sociological jargon, Germano-Slavic 
approximations to English, third-rate but modish fiction, and outrages 
to common sense have often disfigured <Partisan,> and in lesser degree, 
the other magazines on the list. What Krim ignores, in his contempt 
for history and for accuracy, is that these magazines, <Partisan> 
foremost, brought about a genuine revolution in the American mind 
from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950. The most obvious characteristic 
of contemporary American writing, apart from the beat nonsense, 
is its cosmopolitanism.   The process of cosmopolitanism 
had begun in earnest about 1912, but the First War and the depression 
virtually stalled that process in its tracks. Without the good magazines, 
without their book reviews, their hospitality to European writers, 
without above all their awareness of literary standards, we might 
very well have had a generation of Krim's heroes- Wolfes, Farrells, 
Dreisers, and I might add, Sandburgs and Frosts and MacLeishes 
in verse- and then where would we be? Screwed, stewed, and tattooed, 
as Krim might say after reading a book about sailors. When 
<Partisan> and <Kenyon> set up shop, Mencken was still accepted 
as an arbiter of taste (remember Hergesheimer?), George Jean Nathan 
and Alexander Woollcott were honored in odd quarters, and the whole 
Booth Tarkington, Willa Catheter (<sic>), Pearl Buck, Amy 
Lowell, William Lyon Phelps atmosphere lay thick as Los Angeles 
smog over the country.   Politics, economics, sociology- the 
entire area of life that lies between literature and what Krim calls 
"experience"- urgently needed to be dug into. The universities 
certainly were not doing it, nor were the popular magazines of the day. 
This <Partisan> above all did; if it had never printed a word 
of literature its contribution to the politico-sociological area would 
still be historic. But it did print good verse and good fiction. If 
the editors sometimes dozed and printed pretentious, New York-mind 
dross, they also printed Malraux, Silone, Chiaromonte, Gide, Bellow, 
Robert Lowell, Francis Fergusson, Mary McCarthy, Delmore 
Schwartz, Mailer, Elizabeth Hardwick, Eleanor Clark, and a host 
of other good writers. <Partisan Review> and the other literary magazines 
helped to educate, in the best sense, an entire generation. That 
these magazines also deluded the Krims of the world is unfortunate 
but inevitable. It is a fact of life that magazines are edited by 
groups: they have to be or they wouldn't be published at all. And 
it is also a fact of life that there will always be youngish half-educated 
people around who will be dazzled by the glitter of what looks like 
a literary movement. (There are no literary movements, there are 
only writers doing their work. Literary movements are the creation of 
pimps who live off writers.) When Krim says "mine was as severe a 
critical-intellectual environment as can be imagined", he is off his 
rocker. He indicates that he has none of the disciplines that criticism 
requires, including education; the result was his inevitable bedazzlement 
through ignorance. He wasn't being educated in those Village 
bull-sessions, as he claims. No one was ever educated through bull-sessions 
in anything other than, to quote him again, "perfumed bullshit". 
Only a New York hick would expect to find the literary 
life in Greenwich Village at any point later than Walt Whitman's 
day. The "highly intellectual **h minds" that Krim says he encountered 
in the Village did their work in spite of, not because of, any 
Village atmosphere. But Krim's complaint is important because not 
only in New York, but in other cities and in universities throughout 
this country, young and not so young men at this moment are being 
bedazzled by half-digested ideas. Those who have quality will outgrow 
the experience; the rest will turn beat, or into dentists, or into 
beat dentists.   For the sad truth is that while one might write 
well without having read "Bartleby the Scrivener", one is more 
likely to write well if one has read it, and much else. The most appalling 
aspect of Krim's piece is his reflection of the beat aesthetic. 
He mentions the beats only once, when he refers to their having "revived 
through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to commit 
death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression 
and actual experience **h", but the entire narrative is written 
in the tiresome vocabulary of that lost and dying cause, and in the 
sprung syntax that is supposed to supplant our mother tongue. Krim's 
aesthetic combines anti-intellectualism, conscious and unconscious 
nai^vete, and a winsome reliance upon the "natural" and upon "experience". 
Ideas are the "thruway to nowhere". "My touchstones 
**h had been strictly literature and, humanly enough, <American> 
literature (because that was what I wanted to write)". He alludes 
to something called "direct writing", and he finds that criticism 
gets in the way of his "truer, realer, imaginative bounce". 
There had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and 
defacing of the bust of Lauro di Bosis near the Villa Lante and in 
the Gianicolo.   Something was happening all right, slowly it 
is true, but you could feel it. The Italians felt it. Little things. 
An Italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around 
the area of Quirinal Palace, the first time since the war. At least 
they hadn't stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated, flat, 
dialect mispronunciation of Mussolini's home district- <Dogumenti, 
per favore>. But, who knew, that might be coming one of these days. 
There were other Italians who still bore scars they had earned 
in police station basements, resisting. They laughed and, true to national 
form and manners, never talked long or solemnly on any subject 
at 
all, but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts.

We saw Giuseppe Berto at a party once in a while, tall, lean, 
nervous and handsome, and, in our opinion, the best novelist of them 
all except Pavese, and Pavese is dead. Berto's <The Sky Is 
Red> had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book 
to come out of the war. Now he was married to a beautiful girl, had 
a small son, and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the 
movies. On his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of 
<The Count of Monte Cristo>. On his bookshelves were some of 
the latest American novels, including Bellow's <Seize the Day,> 
but he hadn't read them (they were sent by American publishers) and 
wasn't especially interested in what the American writers were up 
to. He was interested in Robert Musil's <The Man without Qualities>. 
So were a lot of other people. He was interested in Italo 
Svevo. He was thinking his way into a new novel, a big one, one that 
people had been waiting for. It was going to be hard going all the 
way because he hadn't written seriously for a while, except for a few 
stories, was tired of the old method of <realismo> he had so successfully 
used in <The Sky Is Red>. This one was going to be different. 
He had bought a little piece of property down along the coast 
of the hard country of Calabria that he knew so well. He was going 
to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all, leave Rome 
and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life, go back to Calabria.

Berto seemed worried, too. He knew all about it and had put 
it down in journal form in <The War in a Black Shirt>, a wonderful 
book not, for some strange reason, published in the U&S&. He 
knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor, 
southern, peasant boy. He knew all about the infection and the fever, 
and, too, the moment of realization when he saw for himself, threw up 
his hands and quit, ended the war as a prisoner in Texas. Berto knew 
all about Fascism. So did his friend, the young novelist Rimanelli. 
Rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous, says what he 
thinks. He had put it down in a war novel, <The Day of the Lion>. 
These people were not talking much about it, but you, a foreigner, 
sensed their apprehension and disappointment.   So there we were 
talking around and about it. The English lady said she had to go 
to Vienna for a while. It was a pity because she had planned to lay 
a wreath at the foot of the Garibaldi statue, towering over Rome in 
spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the Gianicolo. Around 
that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos 
and there is a glowing view of the whole city, in that park are the 
rows of marble busts of Garibaldi's fallen men, the ones who one 
day rushed out of the Porta San Pancrazio and, under fire all the way, 
up the long, straight narrow lane to take, then lose the high ground 
of the Villa Doria Pamphili. When they lost it, the French artillery 
moved in, and that was the end for Garibaldi that time, on 30 
April 1849. Once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow 
lane. We had walked it many times and shivered, figuring what a 
fish barrel it had been for the French. Now the park is filled with 
marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and 
proper names of the men who fell.   We were at a party once and 
heard an idealistic young European call that awful charge <glorious>. 
Our companion was a huge, plain-spoken American sculptor who had 
been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across France in 1944. He said 
it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that, no 
matter who gave the order and what for.   "Oh, it would be butchery 
all right", 
the European said. "We would see it that way, but 
it was glorious <then>. It was the last time in history anybody could 
do something gloriously like that".   I thought: Who is 
older now? Old world and new world.   The sculptor looked at 
him, bugeyed and amazed, angry. He had made an assault once with 180 
men. It was a picked assault company. They went up against an ~SS 
unit of comparable size, over a little rise of ground, over an open 
field. Object- a village crossroads. They made it, killed every last 
one of the Krauts, took the village on schedule. When it was over, 
eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded. The 
whole thing, from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks, 
spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight 
rise of ground and then jumped off, took maybe between twenty and 
thirty minutes. The sculptor looked at him, let the color drain out 
of his face, grinned, and looked down into his drink, a bad Martini 
made with raw Italian gin.   "Bullshit", he said softly.

"Excuse me", the European said. "I am not familiar with 
the expression".   The apartment where we were talking that afternoon 
in March faced onto the street Garibaldi's men had charged 
up and along. Across the way from the apartment building is a ruined 
house, shot to hell that day in 1849, and left that way as a memorial. 
There is a bronze wreath on the wall. Like everything else in Rome, 
ruins and monuments alike, that house is lived in. I have seen diapers 
strung across the ruined roof.   The English lady really 
wanted to put a wreath on the Garibaldi monument on the 30th of April. 
She had her reasons for this. For one thing, there wasn't going 
to be any ceremony at all this year. There were a few reasons for that, 
too: Garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the Communists 
nowadays. Therefore the government wanted no part of him. (It is 
sort of as if our government should decide to disown Washington or Lincoln 
for the same reason.) And then there were ecclesiastical matters, 
the matter of Garibaldi's anti-clericalism. There was a new Pope 
and the Vatican was making itself heard and felt these days. As 
it happens the English lady is a good Catholic herself, but of more 
liberal political persuasion. Nothing was going to be done this year 
to celebrate Garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of Rome. All 
that the English lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument 
and lay a wreath at its base. This would show that somebody, even a foreigner 
living in Rome, cared. And then there were other things. Some 
of the marble busts in the park are of young Englishmen who fought 
and died for Garibaldi. She also mentioned leaving a little bunch 
of flowers at the bust of Lauro di Bosis.   It is hard for me 
to know how I feel about Lauro di Bosis. I suffer from mixed feelings. 
He was a well-to-do, handsome, and sensitive young poet. His bust 
shows an intense, mustached, fine-featured face. He flew over Rome 
one day during the early days of Mussolini and scattered leaflets over 
the city, denouncing the Fascists. He was never heard of again. 
He is thought either to have been killed by the Fascists as soon as 
he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing 
his plane. He was, thus, an early and spectacular victim. And there 
is something so wonderfully romantic about it all. He really didn't 
know how to fly. He had crashed on take off once before. Gossip had 
it (for gossip is the soul of Rome) that a famous American dancer 
of the time had paid for both the planes. It was absurd and dramatic. 
It is remembered and has been commemorated by a bust in a park and a 
square in the city which was renamed Piazzo Lauro di Bosis after the 
war. Most Romans, even some postmen, know it by the old name.

Faced with a gesture like Di Bosis', I find usually that my 
sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend. The things that 
happened in police station basements were dirty, grubby, and most often 
anonymous. No poetry, no airplanes, no dancers. That is how the real 
routine of resistance goes on, and its strength is directly proportionate 
to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be 
taken to pieces, piece by piece, without quitting. It is an ugly business 
and there are few, if any, wreaths for them. I keep thinking 
of a young woman I knew during the Occupation in Austria. She was 
from Prague. She had been picked up by the Russians, questioned in 
connection with some pamphlets, sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage. 
She escaped, crawled through the usual mine fields, under barbed 
wire, was shot at, swam a river, and we finally picked her up in Linz. 
She showed us what had happened to her. No airplanes, no Nathan 
Hale statements. Just no spot, not even a dimesize spot, on her whole 
body that wasn't bruised, bruise on top of bruise, from beatings. 
I understand very well about Lauro di Bosis and how his action 
is symbolic. The trouble is that like many symbols it doesn't seem 
a very realistic one.   The English lady wanted to pay tribute 
to Garibaldi and to Lauro di Bosis, but she wasn't going to be here 
to do it. Were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for 
her, by proxy so to speak? There was a pretty thorough silence at 
that point. My spoon stirring coffee, banging against the side of the 
cup, sounded as loud as a bell. I thought: What the hell? Why 
not? I said I would do it for her.   I had some reasons, too. 
I admire the English lady. I hate embarrassing silences and have 
been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one. I also 
had and have feelings about Garibaldi. Like every Southerner I can't 
escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats, forlorn lost causes. 
Though Garibaldi's fight was small shakes compared to Pickett's 
Charge- which, like all Southerners, I view in almost Miltonic 
terms, fallen angels, etc&- I associated the two. And to top 
it all I am often sentimental on purpose, trying to prove to myself 
that I am not <afraid of sentiment>. So much for all that. 
The English lady was pleased and enthusiastic. She gave me the names 
of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even 
march up to the monument with me. The idea of the march pleased her. 
Maybe twenty, thirty, fifty. **h Maybe I could call Rimanelli 
at the magazine <Rottosei> where he worked.

#TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY#

The Small Business Administration 
(~SBA) provides guidance and advice on sources of technical 
information relating to small business management and research 
and development of products. _SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT_ Practical 
management problems and their suggested solutions are dealt with in 
a series of ~SBA publications. These publications, written especially 
for the managers or owners of small businesses, indirectly aid in 
community development programs. They are written by specialists in 
numerous types of business enterprises, cover a wide range of subjects, 
and are directed to the needs and interests of the small firm.

~SBA offers Administrative Management Courses, which are designed 
to improve the management efficiency and "know-how" of small 
business concerns within a community. ~SBA cosponsors these courses 
with educational institutions and community groups.   Through 
the ~SBA's Management Counseling Program, practical, personalized 
advice on sound management principles is available upon request 
to both prospective and established businessmen in a community. One-day 
conferences covering some specific phase of business management, 
also part of the continuing activities of the Small Business Administration, 
aid community economic development programs. These short, "streamlined" 
meetings usually are sponsored by local banks, Chambers 
of Commerce, trade associations, or other civic organizations. _PRODUCT 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_ Production specialists in ~SBA 
regional offices are available to help individual small business concerns 
with technical production problems. Guidance and advice are available 
on new product research and development; new product potential; 
processing methods; product and market developments; new industrial 
uses for raw, semi-processed and waste, materials; and industrial 
uses 
for agricultural products.   ~SBA serves also as a clearing 
house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable 
for exploitation by small firms. This may be helpful in improving the 
competitive position of established firms through diversification and 
expansion or through more economical utilization of plant capacity. 
_PRODUCTION ASSISTANCE_ Production specialists are available in 
~SBA regional offices to help individual small business concerns 
with technical production problems. These problems frequently arise 
where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the 
lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications 
require operations that the firm did not understand when it 
undertook the contract. Production assistance often takes the form of 
locating tools or materials which are urgently needed. Advice is given 
also on problems of plant location and plant space. _PROPERTY SALES 
ASSISTANCE_ The property sales assistance program is designed to 
assist small business concerns that may wish to buy property offered 
for sale by the Federal Government. Under this program, property sales 
specialists in the Small Business Administration regional offices 
help small business concerns to locate Federal property for sale and 
insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for 
surplus personal and real property and certain natural resources, including 
timber from the national forests.   ~SBA works closely 
with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal 
Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those 
types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be 
interested in purchasing. Proposed property sales of general interest 
to small business concerns are publicized through ~SBA regional 
news releases, and by "flyers" directed to the small business concerns. 
Each ~SBA regional office also maintains a "want" list 
of surplus property, principally machinery and equipment, desired by 
small business concerns in its area. When suitable equipment is located 
by the ~SBA representative, the small business concern is contacted 
and advised on when, where, and how to bid on such property. 
_FACILITIES INVENTORY_ Section 8 (~b) (2) of the Small Business 
Act, as amended, authorizes the ~SBA to make a complete inventory 
of the productive facilities of small business concerns. The Administration 
maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business 
industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered. It is kept 
in each Regional office for the small firms within the region. Purpose 
of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities 
in ~SBA's facilities register so that the small business concerns 
may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized 
by the Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration. 
These services include procurement and technical assistance and 
notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts 
for products and services within the registrants' field of operations. 
~SBA can make complete facilities inventories of all small business 
concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and staff limitations.

Office, Washington 25, D&C&. 

#LOANS#

_TO SMALL BUSINESS_ 
~SBA makes loans to individual small business firms, providing 
them with financing when it is not otherwise available through private 
lending sources on reasonable terms. Many such loans have been made 
to establish small concerns or to aid in their growth, thereby contributing 
substantially to community development programs. _LOAN POLICIES._ 
~SBA loans, which may be made to small manufacturers, small 
business pools, wholesalers, retailers, service establishments and 
other small businesses (when financing is not otherwise available to them 
on reasonable terms), are to finance business construction, conversion, 
or expansion; the purchase of equipment, facilities, machinery, 
supplies, or materials; or to supply working capital. Evidence that 
other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided. _TYPES 
OF LOANS._ ~SBA business loans are of two types: "participation" 
and "direct". Participation loans are those made jointly 
by the ~SBA and banks or other private lending institutions. Direct 
loans are those made by ~SBA alone. To qualify for either 
type of loan, an applicant must be a small business or approved small 
business "pool" and must meet certain credit requirements. A small 
business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated 
and which is not dominant in its field. In addition, the ~SBA 
uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar volume of the business. 
_CREDIT REQUIREMENTS._ The credit requirements stipulate that 
the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully 
and have enough capital in the business so that, with loan assistance 
from the ~SBA, it will be able to operate on a sound financial 
basis. A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently 
secured so as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment. The record 
of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the 
ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income. _LOAN 
AMOUNT._ The amount which may be borrowed from the ~SBA 
depends on how much is required to carry out the intended purpose of the 
loan. The maximum loan which ~SBA may make to any one borrower 
is $350,000. Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments- 
usually monthly, including interest at the rate of 5-1/2 percent 
per annum on the unpaid balance- and have a maximum maturity 
of 10 years; the term of loans for working capital is 6 years. _CONTACT_

The Farm Credit Administration, an independent agency 
located within the Department of Agriculture, supervises and coordinates 
a cooperative credit system for agriculture. The system is composed 
of three credit services, Federal Land Banks and National Farm 
Loan Associations, Federal Intermediate (short-term) Credit Banks, 
and Banks for Cooperatives. This system provides long- and short-term 
credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing, purchasing, 
and business service organizations.   As a source of investment 
capital, the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages 
the development of industries in rural areas. The credit provdied 
by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for 
general agricultural purposes. The third credit service, Banks for 
Cooperatives, exists under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933. 
The Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent 
source of credit on a sound basis for farmers' cooperatives. _TYPES 
OF LOANS._ Three distinct classes of loans are made available 
to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives: Commodity 
loans, operating capital loans, and facility loans. _ELIGIBILITY._ 
To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives, a cooperative 
must be an association in which farmers act together in processing 
and marketing farm products, purchasing farm supplies, or furnishing 
farm business services, and must meet the requirements set forth 
in the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended. _INTEREST RATES._ 
Interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with 
the approval of the Farm Credit Administration. _CONTACT_ For 
further information, contact the Bank for Cooperatives serving the 
region, or the Farm Credit Administration, Research and Information 
Division, Washington 25, D&C&. _PRINTED MATERIAL_ Available,

in Rural Development> (Circular No& 44), and <The Cooperative 
Farm Credit System> (Circular No& 36-~A). 

#MINERALS 
EXPLORATION#

To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals, 
the Office of Minerals Exploration (~OME) of the U&S& 
Department of the Interior offers financial assistance to firms 
and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 
1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the ~OME regulations. 
_REQUIREMENTS_ This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily 
would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or 
circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds 
from commercial sources on reasonable terms. Each applicant is required 
to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored. 
The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up 
to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses. 
The applicant pays the rest of the cost, but his own time spent on the 
work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied 
toward his share of the cost. _REPAYMENT_ Funds contributed by 
the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property. 
If nothing is produced, there is no obligation to repay. A 5-percent 
royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract 
is in effect; if the Government certifies that production may be 
possible from the property, the royalty obligation continues for the 
10-year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government's 
contribution is repaid with interest. The royalty applies to 
both principal and interest, but it never exceeds 5 percent. _CONTACT_ 
Information, application forms, and assistance in filing may be 
obtained from the Office of Minerals Exploration, U&S& Department 
of the Interior, Washington 25, D&C&, or from the appropriate 
regional office listed below:

In most of the less developed countries, however, such programing 
is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent. Only a very few of 
the more advanced ones, such as India and Pakistan, have developed 
systematic techniques of programing.   Others have so-called development 
plans, but some of these are little more than lists of projects 
collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals 
without analysis of the actions required to attain them. Only rarely 
is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation. _WE 
CAN HELP IN THE PLANNING PROCESS_ Neither growth nor a development 
program can be imposed on a country; it must express the nation's 
own will and goal. Nevertheless, we can administer an aid program 
in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing.

<First>, we can encourage responsibility by establishing 
as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the 
definition of objectives and the assessment of costs.   <Second>, 
we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on 
the consistency of such projects with the program.   <Third>, 
we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development 
which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources. This 
includes assistance in- **h assembling the basic economic, financial, 
technological, and educational information on which programing depends; 
**h surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad 
sectors of the economy, such as transport, agriculture, communication, 
industry, and power; **h designing the financial mechanisms of the 
economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation; and **h 
administrative practices which will make possible the more effective 
review and implementation of programs once established. _WE MUST USE 
COMMON SENSE IN APPLYING CONDITIONS_ The application of conditions 
in the allocation 
of aid funds cannot, of course, be mechanical. It must 
be recognized that countries at different stages of development have 
very different capabilities of meeting such conditions. To insist 
on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond 
the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration 
of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage 
more rapid growth.   In the more primitive areas, where the capacity 
to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited, some activities 
may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them 
before a well worked out program is available. Thus, we might provide 
limited assistance in such fields as education, essential transport, 
communications, and agricultural improvement despite the absence of 
acceptable country programs. In such a case, however, we would encourage 
the recipient country to get on with its programing task, supply 
it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task, and 
make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance 
to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress 
being made.   At the other end of the spectrum, where the 
more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through 
decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program, we should 
be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval 
as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support, 
in cooperation with other developed countries, of the essential 
foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program. 

#D. ENCOURAGING SELF-HELP#

_1. THE REASONS FOR STRESSING SELF-HELP_ 
A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing 
is one important kind of self-help. There are many others. It is vitally 
important that the new U&S& aid program should encourage all 
of them, since the main thrust for development must come from the less 
developed countries themselves. External aid can only be marginal, 
although the margin, as in the case of the Marshall plan, can be decisive. 
External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help. 
U&S& aid, therefore, should increasingly be designed to 
provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves 
can take. _AID ADVICE IS NOT INTERFERENCE_ In establishing 
conditions of self-help, it is important that we not expect countries 
to remake themselves in our image. Open societies can take many forms, 
and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their 
own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals. 
On the other hand, it is no interference with sovereignty to point 
out defects where they exist, such as that a plan calls for factories 
without power to run them, or for institutions without trained personnel 
to staff them. Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned 
with a country's development potential, we can be blunt in suggesting 
the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur. 
_2. THE RANGE OF SELF-HELP_ The major areas of self-help 
are the following: _(A) THE EFFECTIVE MOBILIZING OF RESOURCES._ 
This includes not only development programing, but also establishing 
tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment; 
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation; 
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial 
resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury 
consumption by a few. _(B) THE REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL 
SOURCES._ This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises, 
with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting 
realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports. 
It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate 
projects after they are completed. _(C) TAPPING THE ENERGIES OF 
THE ENTIRE POPULATION._ For both economic and political reasons 
all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth 
of a country. Otherwise, development will not lead to longrun stability. 
_(D) HONESTY IN GOVERNMENT._ In many societies, what we 
regard as corruption, favoritism, and personal influence are so accepted 
as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part 
of 
routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination 
will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted 
but unfriendly. Yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources 
if dishonesty, corruption, and favoritism are widespread. Moreover, 
tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion 
of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American 
sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest. Some 
of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support 
can be traced to the identification- correct or not- of Communist 
regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption. 
A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically 
uncomfortable in the short run, but it is politically essential 
in the long run. _3. U&S& POSITION ON SELF-HELP_ The United 
States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with 
aid on a sustained basis, tailored to priority needs, to those countries 
making serious efforts in self-help.   In many instances it 
can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such 
efforts.   There are other countries where, with skillful diplomacy, 
we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups 
in government which would like to press forward with economic and social 
reform measures to promote growth. Governments are rarely monolithic.

But there will be still other countries where, despite 
the inadequacy of the level of self-help, we shall deem it wise, for political 
or military reasons, to give substantial economic assistance. 
Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that 
our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to 
termination. 

#E. ENCOURAGING A LONG-TERM APPROACH#

_1. DEVELOPMENT 
REQUIRES A LONG-TERM APPROACH_ The most fundamental concept of 
the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention, our 
resources, and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and 
social development of the less developed countries. This is not a short-run 
goal. To have any success in this effort, we must ourselves view 
it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years, 
and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same 
fashion. _MOST OF OUR AID WILL GO TO THOSE NEARING SELF-SUFFICIENCY_ 
How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort 
will vary greatly from country to country. In several significant cases, 
such as India, a decade of concentrated effort can launch these 
countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic 
and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance. 
These cases in which light is already visible at the other 
end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb 
the bulk of our capital assistance. _GRADUALLY OTHERS WILL MOVE UP TO 
THE SAME LEVEL_ The number of countries thus favorably situated is 
small, but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the 
underdeveloped world. Meantime, over the decade of the sixties, we 
can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big 
push into self-sustaining growth. In still others which are barely on 
the threshold of the transition into modernity, the decade can bring 
significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their 
human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded 
range of developmental activities is possible. _AID IS A LONG-TERM 
PROCESS_ The whole program must be conceived of as an effort, stretching 
over a considerable number of years, to alter the basic social 
and economic conditions in the less developed world. It must be recognized 
as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military 
crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba. It is 
not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted. _2. 
THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR A LONG-TERM APPROACH_ _(A) THE NEED TO 
BUDGET A PERIOD OF YEARS._ Many of the individual projects for 
which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy 
periods. Dams, river development schemes, transportation networks, 
educational systems require years to construct. Moreover, on complex 
projects, design work must be completed and orders for machinery 
and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence. 
Thus, as a development program is being launched, commitments and 
obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by 
twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year. The 
capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting 
and the same is true of country development programs. _(B) THE NEED 
TO PLAN INVESTMENT PROGRAMS._ More importantly, several of 
the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through 
experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for 
at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than 
that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities 
involved are all to take place in the proper sequence. Without such 
forward planning, investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities 
are completed before there is power to operate them or before 
there is transport to service them; or a skilled labor force is trained 
before there are plants available in which they can be employed. 
_(C) THE NEED TO ALLOCATE COUNTRY RESOURCES._ Most important 
of all, the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary 
steps to allocate and commit their own resources. They must 
be induced to establish the necessary tax, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory 
policies. They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help 
measures which are described in the preceding section. The taking 
of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions. Moreover, 
once these steps are taken, they may require years to make themselves 
felt. They must, therefore, be related to long-range development 
plans. _3. PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE_ If the less developed countries 
are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach, the United States, 
as the principal supplier of external aid, must be prepared to give 
long-term commitments. In this, as in so many aspects of our development 
assistance activities, the incentive effects of the posture we take 
are the most important ones. The extent to which we can persuade 
the less developed countries to appraise their own resources, to set targets 
toward which they should be working, to establish in the light 
of this forward 
perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate 
attention, and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves, 
all on a realistic long-term basis, will depend importantly 
on the incentives we place before them. If they feel that we are taking 
a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into 
reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities, 
they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required. 
Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear 
evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we 
have responded with long-term commitments.

You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 
50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and 
the Hitlers and the Mussolinis, the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs, 
come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation 
that mankind has ever known. Then I have seen the pride of country 
well in the eyes of these young people.   So, I say, Mr& Speaker, 
God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body 
but for the United States of America and the free world. You remember 
the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago, when someone 
asked him when he was in Canada, and Dean Rusk was in Europe, and 
Vice President JOHNSON was in Asia, "Who is running the 
store"? and he said "The same fellow who has been running it, SAM 
RAYBURN". 

#GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND#

_MR& MCCORMACK._ 
Mr& Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire 
to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the RECORD; 
and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend 
their remarks. _THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE._ Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was 
no objection. 

#REMARKS OF HON& JOSEPH P& ADDABBO OF NEW YORK# 

_MR& ADDABBO._ It is notably significant that so many Members 
from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for 
our beloved Speaker, the Honorable SAM RAYBURN. I purposely 
refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from 
the State of Texas. I did so because I agree with so many here 
today, that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United 
States. For the dignity, the influence, and the power of the legislative 
branch of our Government- it is a privilege for us to do honor 
to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all 
the people of our country. To honor him is to honor ourselves.

In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced 
many memorable moments. Many of these experiences are so important 
that they will be cherished forever by me. And, like many of you here 
present, I hold as the highlight of all, the occasion of my first meeting 
with the honorable Speaker of the House. At that time, he afforded 
me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need, 
to speak about my background, my hopes, my views on various national 
and local topics, and any problems that I may have been vexed with 
at the time. He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me 
and tremendously wise in his counsel. In conclusion, he wished me well- 
and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express 
himself, he asked to be remembered to my wife and children.   In 
my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise 
than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle. He is most effective 
in the ordinary business of the House, and in the legislative 
accomplishments of this session, he easily rose to great occasion- even 
at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle- 
and as the Nation witnessed these contests, he rose, even as admitted 
by those who differed with him, to the proportions of a hero and a 
noble partisan.   I am highly privileged today to commemorate the 
brilliant career of this parliamentary giant. He will ever be my example 
as a true statesman; one who is thoroughly human, who affects 
no dignity, and who is endowed with real ability, genuine worth, and 
sterling honesty- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the 
country he has loved and served so long. May the Divine Speaker in 
Heaven bless this country with SAM RAYBURN'S continued service 
here for years to come. 

#REMARKS OF HON& WAYNE L& HAYS OF OHIO# 

_MR& HAYS._ It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for 
me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues 
in this paean of praise, respect, and affection for Speaker SAM 
RAYBURN. In this hour of crisis, the wisdom, the dedication, the 
stabilizing force that he represents in current American government 
is an almost indispensable source of strength. He has become in this 
half century the grand old man of American history. It seems to me 
that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition 
to Providence that SAM RAYBURN'S vigor and his life remain 
undiminished through the coming decades.   Here briefly in this 
humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation 
that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country. 
But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress 
in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions SAM 
RAYBURN has made as an individual, as a legislator, as a statesman 
and as a leader and conciliator, to the majestic progress of this 
Nation. It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel 
deeply about the needs, the aspirations, the interests of my district 
and my State. What SAM RAYBURN'S life proves to us all is 
the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and 
with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests 
of one's own community, one's own district, one's own State, 
and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of 
the problems of this the greatest nation of all time.   For SAM 
RAYBURN never forgot Bonham, his home community, and he never 
forgot Texas. In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as 
legislators to our community, our district, our State. And, if we 
follow the RAYBURN pattern, as consciously or by an instinctual 
political sense I like to think I have followed it, then the very nature 
of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected 
in the devotion of our services to our country. For what SAM 
RAYBURN'S life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character 
are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your 
country and neglecting your district. There is no such thing as being 
diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs. The 
two are as one. This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes 
close to being the greatest lesson SAM RAYBURN'S career, up to 
this hour, teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political 
life under our processes of government.   More than that, 
SAM RAYBURN is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity 
so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count 
some of his best friends in the opposition. Through the most rancorous 
battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national 
and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example 
of dignity and honesty, forthrightness and nobility. SAM RAYBURN 
has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and 
ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political 
manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions. This means much to 
the American tradition. It is an answer in its way, individual and 
highly dramatic, to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily 
vicious in its campaign characteristics. And the name RAYBURN 
is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for 
the last half century.   It is, I insist, hard to define the 
RAYBURN contribution to our political civilization because it is 
so massive and so widespread and so complicated, and because it goes 
so deep. But this we know: Here is a great life that in every area 
of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride 
and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities 
of honor, decency, and self-respect. I pray to God that he may 
be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United 
States and the whole world can ill afford to lose. 

#REMARKS 
OF HON& MELVIN PRICE OF ILLINOIS#

_MR& PRICE._ All but two 
of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under 
the Speakership of SAM RAYBURN. Of this I am proud. I have 
a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility 
with which he carries his greatness.   And SAM RAYBURN 
is a great man- one who will go down in American history as a truly 
great leader of the Nation. He will be considered not only great 
among his contemporaries, but as great among all the Americans who 
have played a part in the country's history since the beginning.

I pay my personal tribute to SAM RAYBURN, stalwart Texan and 
great American, not only because today he establishes a record of 
having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than 
twice as long as Henry Clay, but because of the contributions he has 
made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half 
century of service as a Member of Congress.   Speaker RAYBURN 
has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction 
of the House in the Speaker's chair. He had an outstanding record 
as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913, 
the 63d Congress. No one has sponsored more progressive and important 
legislation than has SAM RAYBURN. He is the recognized "father" 
of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security 
and Exchange Commission. But to run the gauntlet of the programs 
SAM RAYBURN brought into being through his legislative efforts 
would fill the pages of today's Record.   No greater pleasure 
has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present 
today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker, this great 
legislator, this great Texan, this great American.   My sincere 
wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today. 

#REMARKS OF HON& JOHN S& MONAGAN OF CONNECTICUT#

_MR& MONAGAN._ 
SAM RAYBURN is one of the greatest American public figures 
in the history of our country and I consider that I have been 
signally honored in the privilege of knowing SAM RAYBURN and sharing 
with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of 
Representatives in the Congress of the United States.   Others 
may speak of Speaker RAYBURN'S uniquely long and devoted 
service; of his championship of many of the progressive social measures 
which adorn our statute books today, and of his cooperation in times 
of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping 
to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy 
international seas.   I prefer to speak, however, of SAM RAYBURN, 
the person, rather than SAM RAYBURN, the American institution.

Although SAM RAYBURN affects a gruff exterior in 
many instances, nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart 
and gentle disposition. No one could be more devoted than he to the 
American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical 
significance in the political history of the world, and I shall never 
forget his moving talks, delivered in simple yet eloquent words, upon 
the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative 
government and their importance in the context of today's 
assault upon popular government.   Above all, he is a person to 
whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional 
problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman. In 
this role of father confessor, he has always been most characteristic 
and most helpful.   On September 16, SAM RAYBURN will have 
served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud 
to join with others in marking this date, and in expressing my esteem 
for that notable American, SAM RAYBURN. 
_ORIGIN OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES._ The practice of state-owned 
vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years. 
At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917.   The 
state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 
200 in 1940.   The automobile maintenance unit, or motor pool, 
came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized 
maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that 
time.   The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive 
management including establishment of cost billing systems, records 
keeping, analyses of vehicle use, and effecting economies in vehicle 
operation. Cars were operated in 1959 for an average .027@ per mile.

Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state 
purchases. Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to 
the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state 
sales or federal excise taxes. _VEHICLE PURCHASE, ASSIGNMENT AND 
USE POLICIES._ The legislature's role in policy determination concerning 
state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to 
appropriating funds for vehicles.   The meaningful policies governing 
the purchase, assignment, use and management of state vehicles have 
been shaped by the state's administrative officers.   Meaningful 
policies include: (a) kinds of cars the state should own, (b) 
when cars should be traded, (c) the need and assignment of vehicles, 
(d) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances, (e) employees taking cars 
home, and (f) need for liability insurance on state automobiles.

A review of these policies indicates: _(1)_ The state purchases 
and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status 
of driver and use of vehicle. _(2)_ The purchase of compact (economy) 
cars is being made currently on a test basis. _(3)_ Cars 
are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy. _(4)_ 
The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible 
according to circumstances. _(5)_ Unsuccessful efforts have been 
made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles. _(6)_ 
It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage 
state cars at their homes. _(7)_ The state has recently undertaken 
liability insurance for drivers of state cars. _AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES 
IN OTHER STATES._ A survey of practices and/or policies in other 
states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals 
several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices.

Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state 
business. Two other states provide vehicles, but only with legislative 
approval.   States which provide automobiles for employees 
assign them variously to the agency, the individual, or to a central pool.

Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition, 
allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles. 
Nineteen states report laws, policies or regulations for assigning state 
vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances. Of these states the 
average "change-over" point (at which a car is substituted for allowances) 
is 13,200 miles per year. _MILEAGE ALLOWANCES._ Mileage 
allowances for state employees are of two types: (a) actual mileage 
and (b) fixed monthly allowances.   Actual mileage allowances 
are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned 
vehicles on state business at the rate of .07@ per mile. Fixed 
monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except 
on a non-itemized basis. Both allowances are governed by conditions and 
restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations.

Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of .07@ per mile for 
use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states' 
rates. The average of states' rates is .076@ per mile. 
Rhode Island's rate of .07@ per mile is considerably lower than 
reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally 
which approximate a .09@ per mile average.   Actual mileage 
allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state. 
The travel regulations, requirements and procedures governing reimbursement 
are controlled properly and not overly restrictive. 
Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject. They have a great 
advantage in ease of audit time and payment. However, they lend themselves 
to abuse and inadequate control measures. Flat payments over 
$50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of 
state-owned vehicles. _TRAVEL ALLOWANCES._ Travel allowances, including 
subsistence, have been revised by administrative officials recently 
and compare favorably with other states' allowances. With few 
exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses 
and $15 per day subsistence. Travel allowances are well-regulated 
and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control. 

#ORIGIN 
OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES#

_GENERAL BACKGROUND._ It 
is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles 
for use of employees in Rhode Island. Few records are available 
concerning the subject prior to 1940. Those that are available 
shed little light. The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that 
at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917. It 
should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles 
is at least forty years old.   The best reason that can be 
advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded 
highway construction during the 1920s and '30s. At that time highway 
engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties. 
Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees, 
and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly 
justifiable.   Once the principle was established, the increase 
in state-owned vehicles came rapidly. And reasons other than employee 
need contributed to the growth. Table 1 immediately below shows 
the rate of growth of vehicles and employees. This rate of increase 
does not signify anything in itself. It does not indicate loose management, 
ineffective controls or poor policy. But it does show that automobiles 
have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same 
proportion to the increase of state employees. In the past twenty 
years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied 
from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now. Whether there were too few automobiles 
in 1940 or too many now is problematical. The fact is simply 
that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion 
as employees to use them. _HISTORY AND OPERATION OF THE MOTOR 
POOL._ While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured, 
subsequent developments concerning the assignment, use, and management 
of state automobiles can be related more clearly. Prior to 1942, 
automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which 
assigned. This responsibility included all phases of management. It 
embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles, who 
was to drive, when and where repairs were to be made, where gasoline 
and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters. 
In 1942, however, the nation was at war. Gasoline and automobile tires 
were rationed commodities. The state was confronted with transportation 
problems similar to those of the individual. It met these problems 
by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit (more popularly 
called the motor pool), a centralized operation for the maintenance 
and control of all state transportation. The motor pool then, 
as now, had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located 
throughout the state. It was organizationally the responsibility 
of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund 
basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation. 
In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created 
Department of Administration, an agency established as the 
central staff and auxiliary department of the state government. The management 
of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in 
a recent report in the following manner: "  Under this new 
management considerable progress appears to have been made. The agencies 
of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided 
to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all 
cars. Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained 
losses considerably beyond expectations, the introduction of the cost-billing 
system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping 
the fund on a proper working basis. One indication of the merits of 
the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956, 
while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35%, the 
total maintenance cost increased only 11%. "  In order 
to further refine the management of passenger vehicles, on July 1, 1958, 
the actual title to every vehicle was transferred, by Executive 
Order, to the Division of Methods, Research and Office Services. 
The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility 
for the management, assignment, and replacement of all vehicles. 
(Note: So far as State Police cars are concerned, only their 
replacement is under this division). This tied in closely with the 
current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles 
are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs (in light 
of depreciation) become excessive. Moreover, it allows the present management 
to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly 
distributed throughout the fleet; for example, if one driver puts on 
22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year, their 
cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two 
years, rather than 44,000 miles (and related higher maintenance costs) 
and 16,000 miles respectively".   The motor pool is a completely 
centralized and mechanized operation. It handles all types of 
vehicle maintenance, but concentrates more on "service station activities" 
than on extensive vehicle repairs. It contracts with outside 
repair garages for much of the latter work. Where the pool excels is 
in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses. 
Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon 
of each vehicle, the miles traveled in one year or three years, the periods 
when vehicle costs become excessive, and when cars should be traded 
for sound economies. From this, motor pool personnel develop other 
meaningful and related data. In 1959-60, vehicles averaged an operating 
cost of .027@ per mile. Based on this figure and considering depreciation 
costs of vehicles, pool personnel have determined that travel 
in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car 
than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles. They 
estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data 
of compact cars is compiled, the break-even point may be reduced to 
7,500 miles of travel per year. Table 2 shows operating cost data of 
state vehicles selected at random.   One matter of concern to 
the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate 
central garage facilities. Present pool quarters at two locations in 
Providence are crowded, antiquated and, in general, make for inefficient 
operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of 
such operational needs as stock and repair equipment. Good facilities 
would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle 
costs even more. _PURCHASING PRACTICES._ The purchase of state-owned 
vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases 
of the state. Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary 
cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will 
be made. Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the 
assistance of pool staff, and awards for the purchase of the automobiles 
are made to the lowest responsible bidders. Unit prices for state 
vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public. The reasons 
are obvious: (1) the state is buying in quantity, and (2) it has no 
federal excise or state sales tax to pay. Until 1958 the state was also 
entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the 
dealers.   In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state 
motor pool, cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies 
but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier. This is a normal 
governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting 
principles. The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is 
another matter to be covered in detail later. 

#VEHICLE PURCHASE, 
ASSIGNMENT, AND USE POLICIES#

Probably the most important of all matters 
for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase, 
assignment, use, and management of state vehicles. The legislature's 
role in policy determination in this area for years has been 
confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually 
for the purchase and operation of vehicles. The more meaningful policies 
have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer 
of the state- the Director of Administration. 

#THE RHODE ISLAND PROPERTY TAX#

There was a time some years ago when 
local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their 
own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as 
well. For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the 
several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property 
tax. This tax was discontinued in 1936.   Since that time 
the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed 
financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in 
earlier years. At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion 
of municipal services as well. Thus, there has come into being 
a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and, 
in addition, must give assistance to its local governments.   This 
financial assistance from the state has become necessary because 
the local governments themselves found the property tax, or at least at 
the rates then existing, insufficient for their requirements. 
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and 
shared taxes, as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments 
for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a 
sales tax at the state level.   Notwithstanding state aid, the local 
governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own 
by strengthening the property tax. This is being done both by the revaluation 
of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property 
hitherto neglected or ignored.   Taxation of tangible movable 
property in Rhode Island has been generally of a "hands off" nature 
due possibly to several reasons: (1) local assessors, in the main, 
are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs, (2) the numerous 
categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely 
difficult, and (3) the inexperience of the majority of assessors 
in evaluating this type of property. _PROBLEMS OF TAXING PERSONAL 
PROPERTY._ Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property, 
and of movable tangible property in particular, two are significant: 
(1) situs, (2) fair and equitable assessment of value. These 
problems are not local to Rhode Island, but are recognized as common 
to all states. _SITUS OF PROPERTY._ Although the laws of the various 
states, in general, specify the situs of property, i&e&, residence 
or domicile of the owner, or location of the property, the exceptions 
regarding boats, airplanes, mobile homes, etc&, seem to add to 
the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment.

Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the 
town in which it is situated. It also provides for the taxation of all 
personal property, belonging to inhabitants of the state, both tangible 
and intangible, and the tangible personal property of non-residents 
in this state. In defining personal property, it specifically mentions 
"all ships or vessels, at home or abroad".   Intangible 
property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater 
portion of the year. Although a similar situs for tangible property 
is mentioned in the statute, this is cancelled out by the provision 
that definite kinds of property "and all other tangible property" 
situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated. 
This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property 
at its location on December 31.   Both boats and aircraft would 
fall within this category, as well as motor vehicles. The location 
of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration, 
and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle 
as being situated where it is garaged. Obviously, it would be impossible 
to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December. 
In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles 
for tax purposes, in the absence of any specific provision it would 
seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or 
aircraft.   A recent example of this problem is the flying of six 
airplanes, on December 31, 1960, from the Newport Airpark in Middletown, 
to the North Central Airport in Smithfield. This situation 
resulted in both towns claiming the tax, and probably justifiably. 
Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that "all 
rateable property, both tangible and intangible, shall be taxed 
to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his 
actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve (12) months 
next preceding the first day of April in each year".   The 
Smithfield tax assessor, in turn, claims the tax under the provision 
of law "**h and all other tangible personal property situated or being 
in any town, in or upon any **h place of storage **h shall be taxed 
to such person **h in the town where said property is situated". 
_ASSESSMENT OF VALUE._ This problem of fair and equitable assessment 
of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of 
fair valuation is dependent on local assessors, who in general are 
non-professional 
and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach 
to the problem. This accounts for the wide variance in assessment 
practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in 
Rhode Island.   This condition will undoubtedly continue until 
such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established, 
or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method 
of standard assessment practice to be adopted.   The Rhode 
Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented: 
"  The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would 
be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing 
all taxable property. An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing 
office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far 
toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout 
the State. A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences 
and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different 
and independent assessing units".   The Institute of Public 
Administration, in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission 
in 1959, recommended "consolidating and centralizing all aspects 
of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally 
organized and equipped for the job". The resulting setup, it was 
declared, "would be similar to that which is in successful operation 
in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode 
Island". _PRACTICES IN RHODE ISLAND._ To determine the practice 
and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property, 
a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or 
boards of assessors in Rhode Island.   The replies from each 
individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the 
personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the 
established policy of the town in each case. There are legitimate reasons 
for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among 
the public officials in each town. These opinions of the assessors 
are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at 
the present time.   In reply to a question of whether they now 
tax boats, airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles, 
nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not. The wording 
of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different 
interpretations. One assessor checked boats only, another trailers 
and tractors, one mentioned house trailers, and two others referred 
to trailers without specifying the type. In two cases, airplanes only 
were indicated.   It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was 
meant in each individual situation, but the conclusion may be drawn 
that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property, and of the remainder 
only certain types are valued for tax purposes. Boats were indicated 
specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats. 
It would seem, then, that movable property and equipment is not taxed 
as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound 
to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property.

So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess 
movable property that the results are inconclusive. Only four towns indicated 
that they made any more than a normal effort to list property 
of this kind.   Of greater interest is a question as to whether 
movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership. 
Fifteen stated that it was according to location, four by residence 
of the owner, and nineteen did not answer.   Twenty-seven assessors 
stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable 
personal property, and only five were opposed. Seven others expressed 
no opinion. On this point there was fairly general agreement that 
assessors would like to do more than they are doing now. It is not 
clear, however, whether they are thinking of all movable property or 
only of boats, trailers, aircraft or certain other types of personal 
property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns.

Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether 
they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or 
at the residence of the owner. Eighteen voted for assessment by the 
town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town 
in which the owner resides. Ten others made no reply. Of those who 
have an opinion, it seems that assessment by location is preferred. There 
was one vote for location being the place where the property is 
situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment 
date.   To summarize, it may be said that there is no one 
prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation 
of movable property, that assessors would like to see an improvement, 
and of those who have an opinion, that assessment by the town of location 
is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge. The need for 
greater knowledge is evident from their replies. 

#BOATS AS PERSONAL 
PROPERTY#

_TAXING OF BOATS._ Interest has been shown for a number 
of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats. 
Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation 
upon real and personal property, but they also have the responsibility 
to raise by a tax "a sum not less than nor more than" a specified 
amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting.

It has been obvious to the assessors, particularly those in shore 
communities, that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal 
property which they have been unable to reach. Through their 
professional organization, the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association 
the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed. 
No satisfactory solution has been found, but this is due more to the 
difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence 
on the part of the assessors.   It has been estimated that 
the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess 
of fifty million dollars, excluding commercial boats. It is obvious that 
this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors 
of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be 
subject to taxation.   It is known that at least five towns (Barrington, 
Bristol, Narragansett, Newport and Westerly) place some 
value on some boats for tax purposes. However, few are taxed, and 
the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on 
the date of assessment of town valuations.   No one really knows 
how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may 
be. Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard 
prior to the recent passage of the state boating law. Only a few 
more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors 
and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season, but many had 
been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought 
the season to an early close.   The assessors' association, 
meeting at Narragansett in September 1960, devoted its session to a 
discussion of the boat problem.

Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story 
in 1960's industrial development effort. Fifty-two companies started 
or committed themselves to new plant construction, totaling 1,418,000 
square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000; a 
new post-World War /2, record. With minor exceptions, this expansion 
was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state 
manufacturers already operating here.   What made these new 
location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 
was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation, Rhode 
Island scored marked progress in new industry, new plants, and new jobs.

Of the major expansions in 1960, three were financed under 
the R& I& Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed 
mortgage plan: Collyer Wire, Leesona Corporation, and American 
Tube + Controls. Leading firms that arranged their own financing 
included Speidel Corporation, Cornell-Dubilier, Photek, Inc& 
Division of Textron, Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry, W& R& 
Cobb Company, and Mays Manufacturing Company.   Expansion 
and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility 
of the Development Council's Industrial Division, and the figures 
quoted above indicate a successful year's operation. Industrial 
Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island 
concerns during 1960, many of whom are still interested in a Rhode 
Island location. They are conscious of this state's new feeling 
of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of 
new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island. _AIDS TO 
SMALL BUSINESS#

Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional 
effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by 
major industries, small business is also afforded considerable attention. 
Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous 
program, directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of 
manufacturers in the lower employment categories.   A primary function 
is the operation of a Government Bid Center, which receives 
bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies. 
Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen 
concerning interpretation of bid invitations, where to obtain specifications, 
and follow-ups concerning qualification. During the past year, 
10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement 
leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers.   In addition, 
the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services 
to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses; 
how and where to apply for financial assistance; details on marketing; 
information concerning patents, copyrights and trade marks, availability 
of technical reports, and other subjects of interest to small 
business.   The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is 
also active in the field of international trade, assisting Rhode Island 
firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad. This office cooperates 
with the U& S& Department of Commerce in giving statewide 
coverage 
to services which include: statistics on markets abroad; locating 
foreign agents, buyers, distributors, etc&; information on 
foreign and domestic import duties and regulations, licensing, investments, 
and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad, and 
documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements 
for payment.   During the year 1960, this office supplied 954 visitors 
with information related to foreign and domestic commerce, and 
made 73 field visits. _ADVERTISING PROGRAM_ Our media advertising 
continued, during 1960, its previous effective program that stressed 
such specifics as 100% financing, plant availabilities, and location 
advantages. We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement 
of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established 
new plants here.   To reach a still greater audience of location-minded 
manufacturers, our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal 
year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000, and the Industrial 
Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 
to $20,000.   Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in 
the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal (Eastern and Midwestern 
editions) which averaged two prominent ads per month, and to 
a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and, for the west coast, 
the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal (Pacific 
Coast edition). In addition to the regular schedule, advertisements 
were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times, 
Boston Herald, American Banker, Electronic News and, for local 
promotion, the Providence Sunday Journal. Magazine advertising 
included Management Methods, the New Englander, U& S& Investor, 
and Plant Location.   The direct mail campaign consisted 
of 3 intra state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed 
to electronics, plastics, pharmaceutical, and business machine manufacturers, 
and to publishers. These totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence.

The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 
inquiries; 164 from media and 75 from direct mail. Two hundred and 
nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from 
foreign countries. New York led in the number of inquiries, followed 
by California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. 
Among foreign countries responding were Germany, Canada, Brazil and 
India. _INDUSTRIAL PROMOTION_ An important operation in soliciting 
industrial locations involves what we term "Missionary calls" 
by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists. These 
consist of visits, without previous announcement, on top officials of 
manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas. More 
than 25 carefully selected cities were visited, including New York, 
Brooklyn, Long Island City, Newark, Elizabeth, Stamford, Waterbury, 
New Haven, Bridgeport, Boston, Cambridge, Worcester, and 
Waltham.   Out of a total of 603 calls, 452 contacts were established 
with top executive personnel. We received 76 out-of-state visitors 
interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages, 
and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up 
visits. _INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCES_ During 1960, two important conferences 
were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division. 
In June, the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce- 
in conjunction with local trade associations, chambers of commerce, 
and bank officials- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore 
Hotel. Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the 
United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959. Approximately 
100 representatives of business attended this conclave and 
the R& I& Export Conference Committee later voted to continue 
the activity as an annual event.   On October 8th of last year, 
the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference 
on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School. A 
comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development 
effort attracted 143 interested individuals.   Morning sessions 
included addresses by Ward Miller, Jr& of the U& S& Dept& 
of Commerce. Richard Preston, executive director of the New Hampshire 
State Planning and Development Commission, and Edwin C& 
Kepler of General Electric Company. Workshop sessions in the afternoon 
featured development executives from Pennsylvania, Connecticut 
and Maine, and rounded out a rewarding program.   In connection 
with this conference, a 64-page supplement was published in the October 
2nd edition of the Providence Sunday Journal. Devoted to the 
improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction 
in Rhode Island, it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this 
Division. More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients. 
_MAILINGS AND PUBLICATIONS_ Other special mailings by the 
Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's 
Conference, letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical 
Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints 
of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society 
of Industrial Realtors. 1184 copies of the R& I& Directory of 
Manufacturers were distributed: 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state.

The Industrial Division published, in 1960, a new, attractive 
industrial brochure, "Rhode Island- Right For Industry", 
and prepared 
copy for a new edition of the Directory of Manufacturers (to be 
printed shortly), and for a new space catalogue.   Additional promotional 
activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation 
Turnkey, the new automated post office, and a conference with 
representatives of Brown University, Providence College, and University 
of Rhode Island, and eight electronics concerns regarding 
the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel. 

#PLANNING 
DIVISION#

Stated in its simplest terms, the main job of the 
Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode 
Island. The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable 
detail in the enabling act of the Development Council, which 
assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties 
in the field of planning.   Two years ago, the Institute of 
Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled 
"State-Local Relations in Metropolitan Rhode Island. As 
the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in 
this report, plus an analysis of our own enabling act, the Planning 
Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused 
a reorientation of its work program. These objectives are stated here 
because of their importance in understanding the current activities 
of the Planning Division. _(1)_ First priority will be given to 
the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background 
for all other planning activities in the state. _(2)_ Recognizing 
the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration 
that "Metropolian Planning (in Rhode Island) means, or 
should mean, state planning", the state guide plan will take into account 
the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems. 
_(3)_ It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage 
the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility 
of local government. To this end, the community assistance program 
of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function 
to make available, on a shared cost basis, technical planning 
assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their 
own planning staff. _(4)_ The planning division will take the initiative 
in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government; 
among the operating departments of the state; between the cities 
and towns of the state; and on a regional basis between the six New 
England states. _(5)_ On the basis that all citizens of the state 
are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources, 
plans for the provision of essential services (such as water) will 
be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries, within 
the framework of the state plan. _(6)_ The state development budget 
will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority 
of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan. 
_(7)_ In preparing the state guide plan, particular attention will 
be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the 
development of industry and recreation.   Functionally the planning 
division carries out four activities: long-range state planning, 
current state planning, local planning assistance; and the preparation 
of the state development budget. _LONG RANGE STATE PLANNING_ 
The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive 
state planning program in the nation. The long range aspects of 
this program are divided into four distinct phases: basic mapping, 
inventory, analysis and plan and policy formation. The work program, 
as it was originally proposed, was to take five years to complete. Recent 
events- particularly the necessity of providing planning information 
for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department 
of Public Works- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated. 
The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and 
the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1, 1961. _BASIC 
MAPPING_ Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning 
program, the first step taken by the planning division to implement the 
long range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps- 
one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile, and the second a series of 26 sheets 
at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet, covering the entire state. With 
these maps completed, the inventory phase of the plan has been started. 
_INVENTORY_ With the aid of matching federal funds available 
under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended, the planning 
division began a one year program July 1, 1960 to complete the inventory 
phase of the state planning program. this phase consists of four 
items: urban land use, rural land use, physical features and public 
utility service areas. Since the validity of all subsequent planning 
depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information, great care 
is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.

The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff 
has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are 
of significance to statewide planning. The rural land use study is 
being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island 
and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use. 
The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types 
of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to 
public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and, 
like the other two inventory projects, are scheduled for completion 
July 1, 1961. _ANALYSIS_ The collection of information is meaningless 
unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose. 
_SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN RHODE ISLAND._ It is not within the scope of 
this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in 
Rhode Island. However, a word should be mentioned in regard to them 
as independent units of government.   There are forty-seven special 
district governments in Rhode Island (excluding two regional school 
districts, four housing authorities, and the Kent County Water 
Authority). These forty-seven special purpose governments have the 
authority to levy taxes, to borrow money, own property, sue and be sued, 
and in general to exercise normal corporate powers. Unlike cities 
and towns, however, they do not have to submit any financial statements 
to the state Bureau of Audits. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units 
of government. In addition to the collection of service charges, 
the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000. 

#FISCAL YEARS IN OTHER STATES#

_COMPARATIVE DATA._ A 
review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent 
to this report. Included in the findings are: _1._ Forty-six 
states, including Rhode Island, end their fiscal year on June 
30. The other four states end on varying dates: Alabama (Sept& 
30), New York (March 31), Pennsylvania (May 31), and Texas (August 
31). _2._ In sixteen states, the fiscal year ending of the 
cities (June 30) is the same as that of the state: Alaska, Arizona, 
California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, 
West Virginia, Wyoming, and Hawaii). _3._ In eleven states, 
the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31, while the state fiscal 
year ends on June 30 (Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, 
and Wisconsin). _4._ In eight states whose fiscal years close 
on June 30, a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 
31: (Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, 
Virginia, and South Carolina). _5._ One state, Alabama, closes 
its fiscal year on September 30, and all cities in the state, with 
one exception, also close fiscal years on September 30. _6._ 
Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30, while all of its cities 
close their fiscal years on September 30. _7._ Pennsylvania closes 
its fiscal year on May 31. All of its cities close their fiscal 
years on December 31.   The remaining twelve states have varying 
fiscal years for the state, city and local governments. However, 
only Illinois, Oregon, Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation 
in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal 
uniformity. 

#FISCAL UNIFORMITY: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES# 

_ADVANTAGES._ An excellent summary of advantages concerning 
the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained 
in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently. He listed 
among the values of fiscal uniformity: _1._ The uniform fiscal 
year requires compliance with common sense administration of local 
finances: adoption of the budget, or financial plan, in advance of spending. 
_2._ The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another 
common sense rule, that of having cash in the bank before checks 
are drawn. It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to 
take advantage of cash discounts. _3._ The uniform fiscal year promotes 
more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures. 
By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending, upper limits are set 
on expenditures. _4._ The uniform fiscal year brings the town's 
fiscal year into line with that of the schools, which expend the largest 
share of local disbursements. This greatly simplifies the town's 
bookkeeping and financial reporting. _5._ The uniform fiscal 
year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax 
anticipation notes. Furthermore, tax collections not immediately needed 
for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes, 
augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax 
levy. _6._ The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison 
of revenues and expenditures. When towns have the same fiscal 
year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons; and as the 
cost of local government increases, the demand for such comparison also 
increases. Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare.

Of all advantages, probably none is more important than 
the elimination of tax anticipation notes. Borrowing in anticipation 
of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority 
of municipalities at all times. It may be by bank loans, sale 
of notes or warrants, or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and 
registration of warrants. In any event it is a form of borrowing which 
could be and should be rendered unnecessary. Its elimination would 
result in the saving of interest costs, heavy when short-term money rates 
are high, and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always 
available when needed most. This type of borrowing can be reduced 
to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted 
and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year. Any 
approach 
toward such a system looks toward saving and security. 
It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons 
for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform 
fiscal year. Both the federal and state governments commence their 
fiscal years on July 1. Both units of government contribute increasingly 
large sums of money to the several local governments in this 
state as indicated below: @   It has been said that when local 
government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property 
tax, the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap; but with 
the growth of state and federal fiscal aid, the emphasis on equalization, 
and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important 
functions, this is no longer true. The haphazard fiscal year calendar 
is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local 
revenue and expenditure relationships. _DISADVANTAGES._ Although 
there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal 
years in Rhode Island, there are also certain difficulties encountered. 
These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal 
uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle. 
One problem is a matter of shifting dates; the other, is how to 
finance the transition.   Little can be done about the changing 
of dates. This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars. It 
usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period 
of time. But cooperation and understanding between local officials 
and the citizenry help lessen this problem.   The other problem 
is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities 
and towns. This will be covered more fully later. It should be kept 
in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can 
convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial 
condition of that town or city. Fortunately, there are no cities or towns 
in the state, with one or two possible exceptions that are in too 
difficult a position to finance the proposed change. Sacrifice will 
have to be made in some cases, but it is to the municipality's advantage 
to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than 
pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely. 

#ADJUSTING THE 
FISCAL CALENDARS#

The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well 
synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great 
for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them. The 
type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent 
of the adjustments needed. Two features are immediately evident. First, 
the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single 
formula. Second, the shift to a uniform July 1-June 30 fiscal year 
will, of itself, improve the tax collection calendars of the great 
majority of cities and towns. There are at least two problems to consider: 
one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar; the other 
is how to finance the adjustments when necessary. The latter matter 
is considered in detail in a later section.   Twelve cities and 
towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a 
uniform and/or coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar. Plans vary from 
the "talking stage" to establishing special committees to accomplish 
this end. What is important here is that many of the cities and towns 
recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the 
initiative to obtain them.   An analysis of the fiscal-tax collection 
year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition 
may not be as painful as is commonly thought. However, it must be stressed 
that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual 
cities and towns involved.   The adjustments needed to establish 
a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout 
Rhode Island, based on a July 1-June 30 year, are shown below. 
_NO ADJUSTMENT NEEDED._ Six cities and towns are presently on a 
July 1-June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection 
year with it. No change is required for these towns. These municipalities 
include: Barrington, Lincoln, Middletown, Newport, North 
Kingstown, and South Kingstown. _ADJUSTMENT OF FISCAL YEAR._ 
One town and one city, Coventry and East Providence, require an adjustment 
of their fiscal year only. This change will automatically adjust 
their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments 
due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year. 
_ADJUSTMENT OF TAX COLLECTION YEAR._ Six cities and towns are now 
on a July 1-June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their 
tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity. These cities and 
towns include Bristol, Glocester, Pawtucket, Cumberland, Central 
Falls, and Woonsocket. _SIMULTANEOUS ADJUSTMENTS._ Two cities 
to be considered, Providence and Cranston, are an enigma. Both have 
excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars. 
However, neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1-June 
30 fiscal year.   The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal 
period could be accomplished relatively easy for them. In that 
both cities end their fiscal years on September 30, they could levy taxes 
for an interim period of nine months, commencing with September 
30 and ending with June 30. These three installment dates would be: 
October 26, January 26, and April 25 (Providence) and November 
15, February 16 and May 15 (Cranston). Both would start their new 
fiscal year on July 1. Their tax collection calendar could then be: 
July 25, October 26, January 26, and April 25, (Providence); 
and August 15, November 15, February 17, and May 15, (Cranston). 
Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform 
fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods. 
_VARYING ADJUSTMENTS._ The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal 
years which end prior to June 30. All of these towns will require 
adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years. Assuming 
an adjustment to the July 1-June 30 fiscal year, the required adjustment 
of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 
3. 

#METHODS OF FINANCING ADJUSTMENTS#

Aside from the matter 
of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars, there is the problem of financing 
the adjustment when this is necessary. It should be emphasized 
strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets 
<do not necessarily> mean financing over and above normal governmental 
requirements. In many communities there is simply no financial 
problem; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods, careful 
fiscal planning and management, or some like combination of techniques. 
In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial 
burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of 
fiscal year changes. Fortunately, such cases in Rhode Island are more 
the exception than the rule.   As shown earlier in Table 1, 
the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection 
calendars. In addition, no two Rhode Island communities are identical 
in relation to their over-all financial condition. These factors 
practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible; each 
situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration 
such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective 
tax calendars, the financial condition of the treasuries, and the length 
of the transition interval. Suitable plans range from those that are 
very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require 
borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds.

The financial problem, where it exists, usually stems from 
the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period. For 
those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments, 
there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone, 
or in combination with others, would minimize if not even eliminate the 
problem. 

#RHODE ISLAND HERITAGE WEEK PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE,JR& 
GOVERNOR#

The theme of Rhode Island Heritage Week for 1961 will 
be "Independence and Union". It commemorates the 185th anniversary 
of Rhode Island's Independence when, upon May 4, 1776, the 
General Assembly, by its action, established the first free republic 
in the New World.   As this year marks the centennial of the 
beginning of the Civil War, this fact is being commemorated with several 
exhibits throughout the State, but most of all paying tribute to 
the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the 
City of Washington, putting at the disposal of President Lincoln 
the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.

On April 30, ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers 
will take place at 1:00 P&M& at the Dexter Training Grounds 
in Providence. The Independence Day celebration will be properly 
observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick 
to the Greene Homestead in Anthony; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, 
JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE 
PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF APRIL 29TH TO MAY 7TH, 1961, 
AS RHODE ISLAND HERITAGE WEEK, advising our citizens that throughout 
this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open 
to visitors as well as industrial plants, craft shops, museums and libraries 
and I 
earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities 
to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding 
week.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand 
and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of April, 
in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one 
and on Independence, the one hundred and eighty-fifth.   Governor 

#ARMED FORCES DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& GOVERNOR# 

The year 1961 marks the fourteenth anniversary of the unification of 
our Armed Forces under the National Security Act of 1947. 
National defense, like the continuing search for peace with freedom 
and justice for all, is "everybody's business". Our investment 
in this effort, the greatest in our Nation's history, reflects our 
determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom.   It 
is a sound investment. As the President has said, "only when our 
arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never 
be employed".   Armed Forces Day is the annual report on 
this investment, a public presentation designed to give our own people, 
and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom 
and justice, the best possible opportunity to see and understand what 
we have and why we have it.   It is the purpose of Armed Forces 
Day to give Americans an opportunity to honor men of the Armed 
Forces, those who have made the supreme sacrifice, those who remain 
to preserve our security. Freedom depends upon them; NOW, THEREFORE, 
DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND 
AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM SATURDAY, MAY 20th, 1961, 
AS ARMED FORCES DAY, reminding our citizens that we should rededicate 
ourselves to our Nation, respecting the uniforms as the guardians 
of our precious liberty.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have 
hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed 
this 17th day of May, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred 
and sixty-one, and of Independence, the one hundred and eighty-sixth.

#NATIONAL MARITIME DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& GOVERNOR# 

The President of the United States, pursuant to a Joint Resolution 
of Congress, has issued a proclamation each year since 1933 
declaring may 22nd to be National Maritime Day.   This date in 
1819 marked the sailing of the S& S& "Savannah" from Savannah, 
Georgia, for Liverpool. This voyage was the first successful 
crossing of the Atlantic under steam propulsion. The day is now appropriately 
set aside to honor the American men and women who have contributed 
to the success of our merchant marine fleet in peace and war.

The Merchant Marine is the "Fourth Arm of Defense", for 
a strong and effective American Merchant Marine is essential to 
the economy and security of our Nation.   Through trade and travel 
across the seas the American Merchant Marine is carrying out its 
historic mission of linking the United States of America with friendly 
nations across the seas; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& 
NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, 
PROCLAIM MONDAY, MAY 22nd, 1961, AS NATIONAL MARITIME 
DAY, reminding our citizens that American Merchant ships and American 
seamen are ready at all times to serve our Nation in the cause 
of freedom and justice.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have 
hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed 
this 20th day of April, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine 
hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, the one hundred and eighty-fifth.

#MISS RHODE ISLAND PAGEANT WEEK PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& 
GOVERNOR#

The Miss Rhode Island Pageant is sponsored by the 
Rhode Island Junior Chamber of Commerce as a part of the nation-wide 
search for the typical American girl- a Miss America from Rhode 
Island. This is an official preliminary contest of the Miss America 
Pageant held each September in Atlantic City. The ideal girl- 
possessed of talent, poise, intelligence, personality and beauty 
of face and figure- is chosen each year to represent Rhode Island.

Many hours are given free by the Jaycees to make this and all 
local pageants outstanding events. Proceeds realized from these pageants 
are used by the Jaycees to help support their various youth, health, 
welfare and community betterment activities throughout the state.

Miss Sally May Saabye, (Miss Rhode Island 1960) says that 
within a short time- on June 17th- her reign will come to an 
end. She hopes that all will support the contestants from our own community 
by attending our Pageants and the State Pageant June 17; 
AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE 
OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF 
JUNE 11TH TO 17TH, 1961, AS MISS RHODE ISLAND PAGEANT WEEK, with deep 
appreciation to the Jaycees, local and statewide, for the presentation 
of their beautiful Pageants and the encouragement of all Rhode 
Island girls to participate.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have 
hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed

#UNITED NATIONS DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR# 

For the purpose of maintaining international peace and promoting 
the advancement of all people, the United States of America joined 
in founding the United Nations.   The United Nations Charter 
sets forth standards which, if adhered to, will promote peace and justice 
throughout the world. It is extremely important for each American 
to realize that the theme "The United Nations is your business" 
applies to him personally.   The world desperately needs the 
United Nations. United Nations Day is the birthday of the United 
Nations, mankind's noblest attempt to establish lasting peace with 
justice; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR 
OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM 
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24TH, 1961, AS UNITED NATIONS DAY, calling upon 
all 
our citizens to engage in appropriate observances, demonstrating faith 
in the United Nations and thereby contributing to a better understanding 
of the aims of the United Nations throughout the land.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused 
the seal of the State to be affixed this 5th day of July, in the year 
of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, 
the one hundred and eighty-sixth.   governor 

#THE STATE BALLET OF RHODE ISLAND WEEK PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, 
JR&, GOVERNOR#

The ballet originated in Italy about 1450. At 
that time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps 
were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer. Ballet 
flowered in Italy during the next hundred years, and about 1550 
was carried to France when the Italian princess, Catherine de Medicis, 
married the King of France. The most famous ballet of that time 
was called Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581). Dances alternated 
with sung or spoken verses. Ballets were used in opera from its beginning. 
They were placed either in the middle of the acts or in the intermissions.

The State Ballet of Rhode Island, the first 
incorporated group, was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge 
of the art of ballet in the Community, to promote interest in ballet 
performances, to contribute to the cultural life of the State, and to 
provide opportunity for gifted dance students who, for one reason or 
another, are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional 
state; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, 
PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1961, AS THE STATE BALLET OF 
RHODE ISLAND WEEK, requesting all Rhode Islanders to give special 
attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural 
life of the State.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto 
set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 
23d day of October, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred

#PROCLAMATION THANKSGIVING DAY BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& GOVERNOR# 

As another Thanksgiving draws near, let us take time out from the often 
hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled 
the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving.   The 
Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during 
their first year in the new land. They had been through trying times, 
but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength 
to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were 
the price they had to pay for freedom. And as the Pilgrims bowed 
their heads in humble gratitude, they shared another feeling- the anticipation 
of what the future held for them and their posterity. They 
could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would 
some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of 
hope to the oppressed countries of the world. They simply turned to God 
filled with gratitude and faith.   We who are living today may 
learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving 
Day. The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us. 
We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we 
enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other 
nations to realize with humble gratitude that God's Providence has 
been with us since the very beginning of our country. And yet, accompanying 
our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial 
time. With world peace constantly being threatened, most of us regard 
the future skeptically, and even with fear. It is at this time that 
we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks 
with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for 
the Lord's protection in the future, if we are to have peace; NOW, 
THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF 
RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 
23RD, 1961, AS THANKSGIVING DAY,   And so, let us remember on 
this day not only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage 
to the Pilgrims, but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue 
to protect us in the future as He has in the past.   IN 
TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal 
of the State to be affixed this 21st day of November, in the year 
of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence, 
the one hundred and eighty-sixth. John A& Notte Jr&

<Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled>, That the 
Act of July 3, 1952 (66 Stat& 328) as amended (42 U&S&C& 
1952-1958), is further amended to read as follows: _SECTION 1._ 
In view of the increasing shortage of usable surface and ground water 
in many parts of the Nation and the importance of finding new sources 
of supply to meet its present and future water needs, it is the policy 
of the Congress to provide for the development of practicable low-cost 
means for the large-scale production of water of a quality suitable 
for municipal, industrial, agricultural, and other beneficial consumptive 
uses from saline water, and for studies and research related 
thereto. As used in this Act, the term 'saline water' includes sea 
water, brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically charged 
water, and the term 'United States' extends to and includes the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories 
and possessions of the United States. _SEC& 2._ In 
order to accomplish the purposes of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior 
shall- _(A)_ conduct, encourage, and promote fundamental 
scientific research and basic studies to develop the best and most economical 
processes and methods for converting saline water into water 
suitable for beneficial consumptive purposes; _(B)_ conduct engineering 
research and technical development work to determine, by laboratory 
and pilot plant testing, the results of the research and studies 
aforesaid in order to develop processes and plant designs to the point 
where they can be demonstrated on a large and practical scale; _(C)_ 
recommend to the Congress from time to time authorization for 
construction and operation, or for participation in the construction 
and operation, of a demonstration plant for any process which he determines, 
on the basis of subsections (~a) and (~b) above, has 
great promise of accomplishing the purposes of this Act, such recommendation 
to be accompanied by a report on the size, location, and cost 
of the proposed plant and the engineering and economic details with 
respect thereto; _(D)_ study methods for the recovery and marketing 
of commercially valuable byproducts resulting from the conversion 
of saline water; and _(E)_ undertake economic studies and surveys 
to determine present and prospective costs of producing water for beneficial 
consumptive purposes in various parts of the United States 
by the leading saline water processes as compared with other standard 
methods. _SEC& 3._ In carrying out his functions under section 
2 of this Act, the Secretary may- _(A)_ acquire the services of 
chemists, physicists, engineers, and other personnel by contract or 
otherwise; _(B)_ enter into contracts with educational institutions, 
scientific organizations, and industrial and engineering firms; 
_(C)_ make research and training grants; _(D)_ utilize the 
facilities of Federal scientific laboratories; _(E)_ establish 
and operate necessary facilities and test sites at which to carry on the 
continuous research, testing, development, and programing necessary 
to effectuate the purposes of this Act; _(F)_ acquire secret 
processes, 
technical data, inventions, patent applications, patents, licenses, 
land and interests in land (including water rights), plants and 
facilities, and other property or rights by purchase, license, lease,

the provisions of this Act during the fiscal years 1962 to 1967, inclusive; 
(b) to finance, for not more than two years beyond the end of 
said period, such grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and studies 
as may theretofore have been undertaken pursuant to this Act; and 
(c) to finance, for not more than three years beyond the end of said 
period, such activities as are required to correlate, coordinate, and 
round out the results of studies and research undertaken pursuant to 
this Act: <Provided>, That funds available in any one year for 
research and development may, subject to the approval of the Secretary 
of State to assure that such activities are consistent with the foreign 
policy objectives of the United States, be expended in cooperation 
with public or private agencies in foreign countries in the development 
of processes useful to the program in the United States: <And 
provided further>, That every such contract or agreement made with 
any public or private agency in a foreign country shall contain provisions 
effective to insure that the results or information developed 
in connection therewith shall be available without cost to the United 
States for the use of the United States throughout the world and 
for the use of the general public within the United States. 
_SEC& 2._ Section 4 of the joint resolution of September 2, 1958 
(72 Stat& 1707; 42 U& S& C& 1958 (~d)), is hereby 
amended 
to read:   The authority of the Secretary of the Interior under 
this joint resolution to construct, operate, and maintain demonstration 
plants shall terminate upon the expiration of twelve years after 
the date on which this joint resolution is approved. Upon the expiration 
of a period deemed adequate for demonstration purposes for each 
plant, but not to exceed such twelve-year period, the Secretary shall 
proceed as promptly as practicable to dispose of any plants so constructed 
by sale to the highest bidder, or as may otherwise be directed by 
Act of Congress. Upon such sale, there shall be returned to any State 
or public agency which has contributed financial assistance under 
section 3 of this joint resolution a proper share of the net proceeds 
of the sale.   Approved September 22, 1961.

<Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled>, That the 
Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to make 
or cause to be made a study covering- _(1)_ the causes of injuries 
and health hazards in metal and nonmetallic mines (excluding coal 
and lignite mines); _(2)_ the relative effectiveness of voluntary 
versus mandatory reporting of accident statistics; _(3)_ the

of the Interior or any duly authorized representative shall 
be entitled to admission to, and to require reports from the operator 
of, any metal or nonmetallic mine which is in a State (excluding any 
coal or lignite mine), the products of which regularly enter commerce 
or the operations of which substantially affect commerce, for the purpose 
of gathering data and information necessary for the study authorized 
in the first section of this Act. _(B)_ As used in this section- 
_(1)_ the term "State" includes the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico and any possession of the United States; and _(2)_

any place outside thereof. _SEC& 3._ The Secretary of the Interior 
shall submit a report of his findings, together with recommendations 
for an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mines 
(excluding coal and lignite mines) based upon such findings, to the 
Congress not more than two years after the date of enactment of this 
Act.   Approved September 26, 1961.

<Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled>, That the 
Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to establish 
and maintain a program of stabilization payments to small domestic 
producers of lead and zinc ores and concentrates in order to stabilize 
the mining of lead and zinc by small domestic producers on public, 
Indian, and other lands as provided in this Act. _SEC& 2. (A)_ 
Subject to the limitations of this Act, the Secretary shall make 
stabilization payments to small domestic producers upon presentation of 
evidence satisfactory to him of their status as such producers and of 
the sale by them of newly mined ores, or concentrates produced therefrom, 
as provided in this Act. Payments shall be made only with respect 
to the metal content as determined by assay. _(B)_ Such payments 
shall be made to small domestic producers of lead as long as the market 
price for common lead at New York, New York, as determined by 
the Secretary, is below 14-1/2 cents per pound, and such payments shall 
be 75 per centum of the difference between 14-1/2 cents per pound 
and the average market price for the month in which the sale occurred 
as determined by the Secretary. _(C)_ Such payments shall be made 
to small domestic producers of zinc as long as the market price for 
prime western zinc at East Saint Louis, Illinois, as determined by 
the Secretary, is below 14-1/2 cents per pound, and such payments shall 
be 55 per centum of the difference between 14-1/2 cents per pound 
and the average market price for the month in which the sale occurred 
as determined by the Secretary. _(D)_ The maximum amount of payments 
which may be made pursuant to this Act on account of sales of newly 
mined ores or concentrates produced therefrom made during the calendar 
year 1962 shall not exceed $4,500,000; the maximum amount of such 
payments which may be made on account of such sales made during the 
calendar year 1963 shall not exceed $4,500,000; the maximum amount 
of such payments which may be made on account of such sales made during 
the calendar year 1964 shall not exceed $4,000,000; and the maximum 
amount of such payments which may be made on account of such sales 
made during the calendar year 1965 shall not exceed $3,500,000. 
In the same period, 431 presentations by members of the staff were made 
to local, national, and international medical groups. _3. EDUCATION:_ 
_A._ The education function of the Institute is carried 
on by the staff in the departments of pathology and its consultants. 
During fiscal year 1959, six courses were conducted: Forensic Pathology, 
Application of Histochemistry to Pathology, Pathology of Diseases 
of Laboratory Animals, Opthalmic Pathology, Pathology of 
the Oral Regions, and a Cardiovasculatory Pathology Seminar. During 
fiscal year 1960, seven courses were conducted: Application of 
Histochemistry to Pathology, Forensic Pathology, Pathology of Diseases 
of Laboratory Animals, Pathology of the Oral Regions, Opthalmic 
Pathology, Forensic Sciences Symposium, and Orthopedic Pathology. 
From 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961, six courses were 
conducted: Workshop in Resident Training in Pathology, Pathology 
of Diseases of Laboratory Animals, Application of Histochemistry 
of Pathology, Orthopedic Pathology, Forensic Sciences Symposium, 
and Forensic Pathology. _B._ During fiscal years 1959 and 
1960, there were 139 military and civilian students who came to the Institute 
for varying periods of special instruction. _4. RESEARCH:_ 
The Institute is engaged in an extensive program of medico-military 
scientific research in both morphological and experimental pathology. 
Among the specific areas of concentration in which the staff is engaged, 
are such projects as biological and biochemical studies of the 
effects of microwaves; study of motor end plates in man and animals; 
investigation of respiratory diseases of laboratory animals; metabolic 
responses to reduced oxygen tension; neuropathology of nuclear 
and cosmic radiation; carcinoma of prostate; evaluation of histochemical 
techniques; and hip dysplasia in dogs. There has been an 
increase in cooperative research with other Federal agencies and civilian 
institutions.   During the period from 1 July 1960 through 
31 January 1961, additional research affiliations were effected with 
the U& S& Army Medical Research and Development Command to 
conduct research in procedures for quantitative electron microscopy, and 
for the study of biophysical and biological studies of the structure 
and function of ocular tissue. Also, the Defense Atomic Support 
Agency sponsored a long-range study at this Institute on the response 
of massive suspension cultures of mammalian cells to acute radiation. 
Other scientific agencies, both Federal and civilian, supported studies 
in quantitative electron microscopical approach to microchemistry 
and microcytochemistry; the investigation of the relationship of 
diphosphopyridine 
nucleotide synthesizine enzyme to tumor growth; morphological 
study and classification of leukemia and lymphoma cases in 
animals; and the study of structural changes in M& leprae and other 
mycobacteria. _MEDICAL ILLUSTRATION SERVICE_ _1._ The Medical 
Illustration Service is responsible for the collection, publication, 
exhibition, and file of medical illustration material of medico-military 
importance to the Armed Forces. In addition to maintaining 
a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases, wounds, and injuries 
of military importance, it provides facilities for clinical photography, 
photomicrography, and medical arts, and operates a printing 
plant, by permission of Congressional Committee, for publication of 
an "Atlas of Tumor Pathology". It also maintains shops for the 
design and fabrication of exhibits, training aids and instruments and 
libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets. _2._ 
During this period, a total of 762 exhibits were presented at 442 
medical and scientific meetings. Of these exhibits, 154 were newly 
constructed. Twenty-nine exhibits received awards. _3._ Visual and 
operable training aids developed by the Medical Illustration Service, 
were used in support of Army Medical Service mass casualty exercises. 
Members of the Medical Illustration Service lectured and 
conducted demonstrations on the use of training aids to military personnel 
and various civilian medical organizations. Demonstrations of new 
and projected training aids were conducted at the Medical Service 
Instructor's Conference, Brooke Army Medical Center, Texas. _4._ 
In support of the emphasis placed by the Department of Defense 
on instruction in emergency medical care, the Medical Illustration 
Service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins 
which are being field tested; and overhead projector transparency 
sets on the subjects of Military Sanitation: First Aid for 
Soldiers; Bandaging and Splinting; the Emergency Medical Treatment 
Unit, Phase /1,; and Emergency War Surgery in support 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (~NATO) Handbook. 
Fifty lantern slide teaching sets on the subject of "Emergency War 
Surgery (~NATO)" were assembled and distributed to the Medical 
Military Services of foreign Governments associated with ~NATO 
and South-East Asia Treaty Organization. The British and 
Canadian Liaison Officers, as well as Office of Civil and Defense 
Mobilization, the American Red Cross, and similar interested organizations 
were informed from time to time as training aids were developed. 
_5._ Nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed 
and distributed, and lantern slide teaching sets on 21 pathology 
subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical Illustration 
Service. Illustrations were prepared for 11 Department of the Army 
manuals and one Graphic Training Aid. Sixteen lantern slide sets 
were loaned to the Government of India and eight sets were forwarded 
to the U&S& Embassy, Managua, Nicaragua for the Educational 
Exchange Program. The Senate Subcommittee on Reorganization and 
International Organizations was provided samples of visual aids on 
first aid and personal health produced by the Medical Illustration 
Service. _6._ Six fascicles (10,000 copies each) of the "Atlas 
of Tumor Pathology" were completed during the period of this report. 
_THE AMERICAN REGISTRY OF PATHOLOGY_ This consists of 25 individual 
registries, two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 
(the Registry of Forensic Pathology and the Testicular Tumor 
Registry). These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical, 
dental, and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling 
of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing 
through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural 
history of various diseases of military-medical importance. The American 
Registry of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in 
medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of 
Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international 
basis, under such conditions as may be agreed upon between 
the National Research Council and The Surgeons General of the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force. The staff utilized the collected material 
in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international 
meetings, exhibits, and published studies. During the period of this 
report, 37,470 new cases were entered into the various registries. 
These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical 
information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational 
purposes.   In this same period, six new fascicles of the Atlas 
of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers 
world-wide. There were 54,320 copies of fascicles sold and 642 
copies distributed free during this period. Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic 
Conferences were prepared, bringing the total to 61 available 
for loan distribution. Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic Conference 
sets were prepared, which makes a total of 70 types of teaching 
sets for loan. During this period, 7,827 teaching sets were distributed 
on loan. The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged 
as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated 
military hospitals. The demand for teaching sets continues unabated 
since they provide the means for the military physicians to review 
the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review 
of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior 
with structural changes. _THE MEDICAL MUSEUM_ In fiscal year 1959, 
the Medical Museum was moved to Chase Hall, a temporary building 
on Independence Avenue at Ninth Street, Southwest, and continued 
to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical 
Services. During the period of this report, 63 panel exhibits 
depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed. 
Of the 375 exhibits (of all types) shown, 161 were new or refurbished. 
Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished, 254 were prepared 
for other agencies. Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study 
purposes. An exhibit, "Macropathology- An Ancient Art, A new 
Science", was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical 
Association.   A three-dimensional exhibit depicting "A 
Century of Naval Medicine" was formally presented to The Director 
by George S& Squibb, great-grandson of the founder of E& 
R& Squibb and Sons, for permanent display in the Museum.

Space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits, and the 
Museum collected new accessions of microscopes, medical, surgical, and 
diagnostic instruments, uniform, and similar items of historical medico-military 
significance.   During the period, the laboratory rendered 
centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters. 
Specimens were mounted for military installations, governmental agencies, 
and medical schools.   Three hundred five copies of the <Manual 
of Macropathological Techniques> were distributed. Thirty-five 
military and civilian students received laboratory training.

During fiscal years 1959 and 1960, there were 795,586 visitors to the 
Museum.   During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 
1961, the Medical Museum was required to move to Temporary Building 
"~S" on the Mall from Chase Hall. Throughout the period 
and during the movement operation, the Museum continued its functional 
support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. 

#ARMED FORCES 
MEDICAL PUBLICATION AGENCY#

The Armed Forces Medical Publication 
Agency, established in 1949, has published, since January 1950, 
the United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice 
publication 
to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department 
officers of the three military services. Its supplement, the Medical 
Technicians Bulletin, supplied similar material to enlisted 
medical personnel. These publications replaced the U& S& Naval 
Medical Bulletin, published continuously from 1907 through 1959, as 
well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of 
the U& S& Army Medical Department, published from 1922 to 1949. 
In addition, their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication 
of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin. Estimated annual 
savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin 
on a triservice basis, as compared with the cost of producing separate 
periodicals for each service, were between $65,000 and $70,000. Additionally, 
on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations, 
the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing 
to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the 
quantity now authorized, in order to provide any reasonably comparable 
coverage.   From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960, 24 numbers of 
the 
Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published. Each Journal contained 
articles of professional and clinical interest, and departments 
devoted to military medical news, reviews of new books, and other features 
of interest to officers of the medical services. The Council 
on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed 
a brief article to each issue entitled, "This is Your A&M&A&".

Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal, 
the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was 
changed from varityping to hot typesetting. This resulted in an improved 
appearance, but was followed by an increase in printing cost that 
necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total 
of allocated funds. The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper 
plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue 
reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with 
nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds.   Two special issues were 
published, one for November 1959 on Space Medicine, the other the 
Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960. The February 1960 issue 
marked the reinstitution of the section entitled, "The Medical Officer 
Writes". Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians 
Bulletin, 
publication of which was suspended with the November-December 
1959 issue, a section called "Technical Notes" was inaugurated 
on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue. Occasional 
features were published on historical medicine, special reports, bibliography, 
and "Collector's Items". In May 1960, the Armed 
Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the "Medical 
Museum", and in June, the Institute started contributing 
a regular monthly "Case for Diagnosis". The Institute also planned 
to furnish a regular series of articles, beginning in the fall 
of 1960, on its more significant Scientific Exhibits.   The Armed 
Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report 
for one of its 12 commissions, so that each commission will report 
once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest 
and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces. The first 
report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue 
of the Journal. 
Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method 
for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine 
when the product is relatively non-volatile. This work gave a heat 
of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value 
which had been determined by a less direct method, and raises this 
property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago. Similar measurements 
are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the 
heat of formation of another important combustion product, beryllium fluoride.

The development and testing of new apparatus to measure 
other properties is nearing completion. In one of these, an exploding-wire 
device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 **f and 
100 atmospheres pressure, a major goal was achieved. The accuracy of 
measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during 
a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison 
with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 
percent. This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals. 
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element 
as a calorimeter. The element is inserted 
in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire, 
and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy. 
This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and 
the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the 
element and the measured voltage across the element.   A high-speed 
shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation 
of any portion of the electrical wire explosion. The shutter consists 
of two parts: a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part. Using 
Edgerton's method, the fast-closing action is obtained from the 
blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires. 
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil 
(approximately **f) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that 
no light may pass into the camera. The opening action is obtained 
when a capacitor, charged to high voltage, is suddenly discharged through 
the foil. During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the 
passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward 
its center line, thus allowing light to pass into the camera. Experiments 
have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds. 
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing 
the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil. 
_LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF INTERSTELLAR RADIO SPECTRA._ Besides 
the well-known hydrogen line at 21 ~cm wavelength, the spectra of 
extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic 
of other atoms, ions, and small molecules. The detection and study 
of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on 
interstellar gas clouds and, perhaps, planetary atmospheres. Among the 
most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light 
diatomic hydrides ~OH and ~CH; somewhat less likely sources 
are the heavier hydrides ~SH, ~SiH, and ~ScH. Very small 
concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable; in interstellar 
gas, concentrations as low as **f molecules/**f may be sufficient, 
as compared to the **f hydrogen atoms **f required for detection of 
the 21-~cm line.   High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved 
by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver; therefore, only with 
precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical 
search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible. To secure precise 
measurements of these frequencies, a research program in free radical 
microwave spectroscopy has been started. Since conventional methods 
are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions, 
the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead. This 
involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor, 
which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave 
range, where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity.

The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance 
method was the ~OH radical. Results of this experiment include 
the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which ~OH may 
be identified in interstellar gas; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 
1667.36 **f, with an uncertainty of 0.10 **f. Success in observing these 
spectral lines has so far, apparently, been confined to the laboratory; 
extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported. Preparations 
are being made for similar experiments on ~CH and ~SH 
radicals. _LOW TEMPERATURE THERMOMETRY._ The Bureau is pursuing 
an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration 
services in the range 1.5 to 20 **f. The efforts and accomplishments 
fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based 
upon the velocity of sound in helium gas, secondary thermometry involving 
principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors, and helium-4 
vapor-pressure measurements (see p& 144). _ACOUSTICAL INTERFEROMETER._ 
An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and 
used, with helium gas as the thermometric fluid, to measure temperatures 
near 4.2 and 2.1 **f. Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute 
temperature measurement, and may be used as an alternative to 
the gas thermometer. When values of temperature derived with this instrument 
were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid 
helium-4 vapor pressures, differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively 
were found. This result is preliminary, and work is continuing. 
_RESISTANCE THERMOMETERS._ Carbon resistors and impurity-doped 
germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary 
thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region. Several 
germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 **f and 
their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree 
when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer 
whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium. Preliminary 
calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 
**f at every 0.1 **f. The estimated standard deviations of the data for 
two of the resistors were @ 1 millidegree; and for the third resistor, 
@ 3.3 millidegrees. _VAPOR PRESSURE METHOD._ The reproducibilities 
of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated 
in conjunction with a "constant temperature" liquid helium bath 
from 4.2 to 1.8 **f. Surface temperature gradients have been found to 
exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15-and 25-liter metallic storage 
dewars. The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 
**f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly 
greater than the ~|l point. A hydrostatic head correction has 
been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures 
or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium. However, the surface 
temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements 
for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate 
the tube (which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb) 
from the liquid helium surface. It has also been observed, in helium 
/2,, that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures 
and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer. This 
has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer. 
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified 
to reduce the helium film flow. _PRESSURE TRANSDUCER FOR ~PVT 
MEASUREMENTS._ Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on 
corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer. 
A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and 
thoroughly tested. The transducer is a null-type instrument and employs 
a stretched diaphragm, 0.001 in& thick and 1 in& in diameter. 
A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance 
between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 
0.001 in& apart (for **f). Spherical concave backing surfaces 
support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent 
the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit. 
Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 **f and at pressures up to 
250 ~atm, an overload of 300 ~psi, applied for a period of one day, 
results in an uncertainty in the pressure of, at most, one millimeter 
of mercury. _TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF AIR._ A 6-year study of the 
transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed. 
This project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic 
Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command, U&S& 
Air Force, and had as its goal the investigation of the transport 
by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding. A significant 
effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl 
numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation 
region. Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal 
diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature 
differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present. 
The results of the study, based on collision integrals computed from 
the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air, 
will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity, thermal conductivity, 
thermal diffusion, and diffusion coefficients at temperatures 
of 1,000 to 10,000 **f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from 
**f to **f times normal density. _INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES._ 
In March, 1961, representatives of the national laboratories 
of Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, U&S&S&R&, 
United States, and West Germany, met at the ~NBS 
to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature 
scale between 10 and 90 **f. As a first step toward this goal, 
arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through 
circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers 
for calibration by each national laboratory. Such a group of thermometers 
was obtained and calibrated at the ~NBS. These thermometers 
have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National 
Physical Laboratory. _TEMPERATURE SYMPOSIUM._ During the 
last week of march 1961, Columbus, Ohio was the site of the Fourth 
Symposium on Temperature, Its Measurement and Control in Science 
and Industry. The Symposium, which was jointly sponsored by the 
American Institute of Physics, the Instrument Society of America, 
and the National Bureau of Standards, attracted nearly one thousand 
registrants, including many from abroad. The Bureau contributed 
to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr& 
W& A& Wildhack, General Chairman, and Dr& C& M& 
Herzfeld, Program Chairman. Dr& A& V& Astin, ~NBS 
Director, opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks, following 
which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week 
by ~NBS scientists, from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories. 

#2.1.6. ATOMIC PHYSICS#

In addition to the basic programs 
in wavelength standards, spectroscopy, solid state physics, interactions 
of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to 
provide the foundation for technological progress, the Bureau has strengthened 
its activities in laboratory astrophysics. The programs in 
infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards 
in the far infrared, the application of infrared techniques to 
solid state studies, and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation. 
Two data centers have been established for the collection, 
indexing, critical evaluation, and dissemination of bibliographies and 
critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision 
cross sections. _LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS._ _TRANSITION PROBABILITIES._ 
Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research 
and the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a data center was established 
to gather and index all published information on atomic transition 
probabilities. An exhaustive survey was made of the literature, 
and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued. 
Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now 
in preparation.   A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was 
constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen 
and oxygen. This apparatus will also be used to measure transition 
probabilities of a large number of other elements. A study of the hydrogen 
line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can 
be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable 
to about **f percent.   A set of tables containing spectral intensities 
for 39,000 lines of 70 elements, as observed in a copper matrix 
in a ~d-c arc, was completed and published. Studies of the intensity 
data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition 
probabilities. These data are not of the precision obtainable by 
the methods previously mentioned, but the vast number of approximate values 
available will be useful in many areas. _ATOMIC ENERGY LEVELS._ 
Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare earth 
elements. New computer and automation techniques were applied to these 
spectra with considerable success. 
_(E)_ In addition to the penalties provided in title 18, United 
States Code, section 1001, any person guilty of any act, as provided 
therein, with respect to any matter under this Title, shall forfeit 
all rights under this Title, and, if payment shall have been made or 
granted, the Commission shall take such action as may be necessary to 
recover the same. _(F)_ In connection with any claim decided by 
the Commission pursuant to this Title in which an award is made, the 
Commission may, upon the written request of the claimant or any attorney 
heretofore or hereafter employed by such claimant, determine and 
apportion the just and reasonable attorney's fees for services rendered 
with respect to such claim, but the total amount of the fees so determined 
in any case shall not exceed 10 per centum of the total amount 
paid pursuant to the award. Written evidence that the claimant and 
any such attorney have agreed to the amount of the attorney's fees 
shall be conclusive upon the Commission: <Provided, however>, That 
the total amount of the fees so agreed upon does not exceed 10 per 
centum of the total amount paid pursuant to the award. Any fee so determined 
shall be entered as a part of such award, and payment thereof 
shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury by deducting the amount 
thereof from the total amount paid pursuant to the award. Any agreement 
to the contrary shall be unlawful and void. The Commission is 
authorized and directed to mail to each claimant in proceedings before 
the Commission notice of the provisions of this subsection. Whoever, 
in the United States or elsewhere, pays or offers to pay, or promises 
to pay, or receives on account of services rendered or to be rendered 
in connection with any such claim, compensation which, when added 
to any amount previously paid on account of such services, will exceed 
the amount of fees so determined by the Commission, shall be guilty 
of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more 
than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twelve months, or both, and 
if any such payment shall have been made or granted, the Commission 
shall take such action as may be necessary to recover the same, and, in 
addition thereto, any such person shall forfeit all rights under this 
title. _(G)_ The Attorney General shall assign such officers 
and employees of the Department of Justice as may be necessary to represent 
the United States as to any claims of the Government of the 
United States with respect to which the Commission has jurisdiction 
under this title. Any and all payments required to be made by the 
Secretary of the Treasury under this title pursuant to any award made 
by the Commission to the Government of the United States shall be 
covered into the Treasury to the credit of miscellaneous receipts. 
_(H)_ The Commission shall notify all claimants of the approval 
or denial of their claims, stating the reasons and grounds therefor, and 
if approved, shall notify such claimants of the amount for which such 
claims are approved. Any claimant whose claim is denied, or is approved 
for less than the full amount of such claim, shall be entitled, 
under such regulations as the Commission may prescribe, to a hearing 
before the Commission, or its duly authorized representatives, with 
respect to such claim. Upon such hearing, the Commission may affirm, 
modify, or revise its former action with respect to such claim, including 
a denial or reduction in the amount theretofore allowed with respect 
to such claim. The action of the Commission in allowing or denying 
any claim under this title shall be final and conclusive on all questions 
of law and fact and not subject to review by the Secretary of 
State or any other official, department, agency, or establishment of 
the United States or by any court by mandamus or otherwise. _(I)_ 
The Commission may in its discretion enter an award with respect 
to one or more items deemed to have been clearly established in an individual 
claim while deferring consideration and action on other items 
of the same claim. _(J)_ The Commission shall comply with the provisons 
of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 except as otherwise 
specifically provided by this title. _SEC& 5._ The Commission 
shall, as soon as possible, and in the order of the making of such 
awards, certify to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the Secretary 
of State copies of the awards made in favor of the Government 
of the United States or of nationals of the United States under this 
Title. The Commission shall certify to the Secretary of State, 
upon his request, copies of the formal submissions of claims filed pursuant 
to subsection (~b) of section 4 of this Act for transmission 
to 
the foreign government concerned. _SEC& 6._ The Commission shall 
complete its affairs in connection with settlement of United States-Yugoslav 
claims arising under the Yugoslav Claims Agreement of 
1948 not later than December 31, 1954: <Provided>, That nothing 
in this provision shall be construed to limit the life of the Commission, 
or its authority to act on future agreements which may be effected 
under the provisions of this legislation. _SEC& 7. (A)_ Subject 
to the limitations hereinafter provided, the Secretary of the Treasury 
is authorized and directed to pay, as prescribed by section 8 
of this Title, an amount not exceeding the principal of each award, plus 
accrued interests on such awards as bear interest, certified pursuant 
to section 5 of this Title, in accordance with the award. Such payments, 
and applications for such payments, shall be made in accordance 
with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. 
_(B)_ There shall be deducted from the amount of each payment 
made pursuant to subsection (~c) of section 8, as reimbursement for 
the 
expenses incurred by the United States, an amount equal to 5 per 
centum of such payment. All amounts so deducted shall be covered into 
the Treasury to the credit of miscellaneous receipts. _(C)_ Payments 
made pursuant to this Title shall be made only to the person or 
persons on behalf of whom the award is made, except that- _(1)_ 
if such person is deceased or is under a legal disability, payment shall 
be made to his legal representative: <Provided>, That if the 
total award is not over $500 and there is no qualified executor or administrator, 
payment may be made to the person or persons found by the 
Comptroller General of the United States to be entitled thereto, 
without the necessity of compliance with the requirements of law with 
respect to the administration of estates; _(2)_ in the case of 
a partnership or corporation, the existence of which has been terminated 
and on behalf of which an award is made, payment shall be made, except 
as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), to the person or persons found 
by the Comptroller General of the United States to be entitled 
thereto; _(3)_ if a receiver or trustee for any such partnership 
or corporation has been duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction 
in the United States and has not been discharged prior to the 
date of payment, payment shall be made to such receiver or trustee 
in accordance with the order of the court; _(4)_ if a receiver or 
trustee for any such partnership or corporation, duly appointed by a 
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, makes an assignment 
of the claim, or any part thereof, with respect to which an award 
is made, or makes an assignment of such award, or any part thereof, 
payment shall be made to the assignee, as his interest may appear; 
and _(5)_ 
in the case of any assignment of an award, or any part thereof, 
which is made in writing and duly acknowledged and filed, after such 
award is certified to the Secretary of the Treasury, payment may, in 
the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, be made to the assignee, 
as his interest may appear. _(D)_ Whenever the Secretary 
of the Treasury, or the Comptroller General of the United States, 
as the case may be, shall find that any person is entitled to any such 
payment, after such payment shall have been received by such person, 
it shall be an absolute bar to recovery by any other person against 
the United States, its officers, agents, or employees with respect 
to such payment. _(E)_ Any person who makes application for any such 
payment shall be held to have consented to all the provisions of this 
Title. _(F)_ Nothing in the Title shall be construed as the 
assumption of any liability by the United States for the payment or 
satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any claim on behalf of any national 
of the United States against any foreign government. _SEC& 
8. (A)_ There are hereby created in the Treasury of the United States 
(1) a special fund to be known as the Yugoslav Claims Fund; 
and (2) such other special funds as may, in the discretion of the Secretary 
of the Treasury, be required each to be a claims fund to be 
known 
by the name of the foreign government which has entered into a settlement 
agreement with the Government of the United States as described 
in subsection (~a) 
of section 4 of this Title. There shall be covered 
into the Treasury to the credit of the proper special fund all funds 
hereinafter specified. All payments authorized under section 7 of this 
Title shall be disbursed from the proper fund, as the case may be, 
and all amounts covered into the Treasury to the credit of the aforesaid 
funds are hereby permanently appropriated for the making of the 
payments authorized by section 7 of this Title. _(B)_ The Secretary 
of the Treasury is authorized and directed to cover into- _(1)_ 
the Yugoslav Claims Fund the sum of $17,000,000 being the amount 
paid by the Government of the Federal People's Republic of 
Yugoslavia pursuant to the Yugoslav Claims Agreement of 1948; _(2)_ 
a special fund created for that purpose pursuant to subsection 
(~a) 
of this section any amounts hereafter paid, in United States dollars, 
by a foreign government which has entered into a claims settlement 
agreement with the Government of the United States as described in 
subsection (~a) 
of section 4 of this Title. _(C)_ The Secretary 
of the Treasury is authorized and directed out of the sums covered into 
any of the funds pursuant to subsection (~b) of this section, 
and after 
making the deduction provided for in section 7 (~b) of this 
Title- 
_(1)_ to make payments in full of the principal of awards of $1,000 
or less, certified pursuant to section 5 of this Title; _(2)_ 
to make payments of $1,000 on the principal of each award of more 
than $1,000 in principal amount, certified pursuant 
to section 5 of this Title; _(3)_ to make additional payment 
of not to exceed 25 per centum of the unpaid principal of awards in the 
principal amount of more than $1,000; _(4)_ after completing the 
payments prescribed by paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, to 
make payments, from time to time in ratable proportions, on account 
of the unpaid principal of all awards in the principal amount of more 
than $1,000, according to the proportions which the unpaid principal of 
such awards bear to the total amount in the fund available for distribution 
at the time such payments are made; and _(5)_ after payment 
has been made of the principal amounts of all such awards, to make 
pro rata payments on account of accrued interest on such awards as bear 
interest. _(D)_ The Secretary of the Treasury, upon the concurrence 
of the Secretary of State, is authorized and directed, out of 
the sum covered into the Yugoslav Claims Fund pursuant to subsection 
(~b) 
of this section, after completing the payments of such funds pursuant 
to subsection (~c) of this section, to make payment of the balance 
of any sum remaining in such fund to the Government of the Federal 
People's Republic of Yugoslavia to the extent required under article 
1 (~c) of the Yugoslav Claims Agreement of 1948. The Secretary 
of State shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the 
total cost of adjudication, not borne by the claimants, attributable 
to the Yugoslav Claims Agreement of 1948. Such certification shall 
be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to review by any other 
official or department, agency, or establishment of the United States. 
_SEC& 9._ There is hereby authorized to be appropriated, 
out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums 
as may be necessary to enable the Commission to carry out its functions 
under this Title. 
_MR& DOOLEY._ Mr& Speaker, for several years now the commuter 
railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly 
difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population 
wants and is entitled to have. The causes of the decline of the commuter 
railroads are many and complex- high taxes, losses of revenue to 
Government subsidized highway and air carriers, to name but two. And 
the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally 
varied, ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete 
discontinuance of this important service.   There have been a number 
of sound plans proposed. But none of these has been implemented. 
Instead we have stood idly by, watched our commuter railroad service 
decline, and have failed to offer a helping hand. Though the number 
of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased 
tremendously since World War /2,, total annual rail commutation 
dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957. Nowhere has this decline 
been more painfully evident than in the New York City area. Here the 
New York Central Railroad, one of the Nation's most important 
carriers, has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949.

At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads, 
a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has 
appeared in the form of the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad's proposal 
for control of the Baltimore + Ohio railroads.   The New York 
Central has pointed out that this control, if approved by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, would give the combined C& + O&-B& 
+ O& Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the 
New York Central. Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful, 
but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic 
away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area.

The New York Central notes: "  The freight traffic 
most susceptible to raiding by the C& + O&-B& + O& provides 
the backbone of Central's revenues. These revenues make it 
possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire 
New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter 
and terminal freight services. If these services are to be maintained, 
the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible".

The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all 
southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City. This is a 
$14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter 
traffic exclusively. A blow to this phase of the Central's operations 
would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad 
itself, but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient, 
reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city. " 
There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful 
C& + O&-B& + O& merger scheme"-   The Central 
has pointed out. "  The logic of creating a strong, balanced, 
competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious 
that B& + O& was publicly committed to the approach outlined here.

Detailed studies of the plan were well underway. Though 
far from completion, these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings 
would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads 
concerned, their investors, their customers, their users, and to the 
public at large.   Then, abandoning the studies in the face of 
their promising outlook for all concerned, B& + O& entered on-again-off-again 
negotiations with C& + O& which resulted in the present 
situation.   In the light of the facts at hand, however, 
New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create 
a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest".

The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its 
deliberations on the proposed C& + O&-B& + O& merger on 
June 18. Obviously, the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force 
the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations 
by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge.

However, there is a more profound consideration to this proposed 
merger than profit and loss. That is, will it serve the long-range 
public interest?   For the past 40 years Congress has advocated 
a carefully planned, balanced and competitive railway system. 
We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter- 
the two-way B& + O&-C& + O& merger, or the three-way 
New York Central-B& + O&-C& + O& merger. Which will 
serve not only the best interest of the stockholders, but the interests 
of all the traveling public? 
_MR& LINDSAY._ Mr& Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a great newspaper, the New York Times, on the occasion of a major change 
in its top executive command.   Arthur Hays Sulzberger has 
been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and 
it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American 
journalism on the occasion of his retirement. I am pleased to 
note that Mr& Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the 
board of the New York Times.   Mr& Sulzberger's successor 
as publisher is Mr& Orvil E& Dryfoos, who is president of the 
New York Times Co&, and who has been with the Times since 1942. 
Mr& Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that 
the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's 
great newspapers will be maintained.   I am also pleased to note 
that Mr& John B& Oakes, a member of the Times staff since 1946, 
has been appointed as editorial page editor. Mr& Oakes succeeds 
Charles Merz, editor since 1938, who now becomes editor emeritus.

I should like at this time, Mr& Speaker, to pay warm tribute 
to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of 
their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism.

My heartiest congratulations go to their successors, Orvil E& 
Dryfoos and John B& Oakes, who can be counted upon to sustain 
the illustrious tradition of the New York Times.   The people 
of the 17th District of New York, and I as their Representative 
in Congress, take great pride in the New York Times as one of the 
great and authoritative newspapers of the world. 
_MR& STRATTON._ Mr& Speaker, in my latest newsletter to my constituents 
I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the 
only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from 
coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. 
Yesterday, I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article 
in the U&S& News + World Report of May 8 which discussed this 
type of action in more detail, including both its advantages and its 
disadvantages.   Under leave to extend my remarks, I include 
the relevant portion of my newsletter, together with the text of the 
article from the U&S& News + World Report: "_YOUR CONGRESSMAN, 
SAMUEL S& STRATTON, REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1961_ 
Cuban S&S&R&: Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting 
from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish 
a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week, there was at least 
one positive benefit, and that was the clear-cut revelation to the 
whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated 
military base.   In fact, one of the major reasons for the 
failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full 
information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian 
military equipment. Somehow, the pictures and stories of Soviet 
~T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing 
rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark, blunt truth 
of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from 
home. Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of 
the United States, violate the Monroe Doctrine, and threaten the 
security of every other Latin American republic.   Once the full 
extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear, President 
Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate 
to prevent this, even if we had to go it alone. But the Latin American 
republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on 
taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally 
throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board. For years 
the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude 
Castro's representative from secret military talks. But it took the 
pictures of the Migs and the ~T-34 tanks to do the job. There 
is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week. You can see 
it, for example, in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made 
to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba 
and Laos; efforts, 
as I see it, which are being directed, by the way, toward 
support for future actions, not for those already past.   What 
the next move will be only time, of course, will tell. Personally, 
I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba. We 
simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons, including the possibility 
of long-range nuclear missiles, being located in Cuba. Obviously, 
we can't stop them from coming in, however, just by talk. A naval 
blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine, would 
be a relatively simple operation to carry out, and would bring an 
abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere". @ "#[FROM 
U&S& NEWS + WORLD REPORT, MAY 8, 1961]#

_NEXT FOR CUBA: 
AN ARMS BLOCKADE?_ Look at Castro now- cockier than ever 
with arms and agents to threaten the Americas.   How can the 
United States act?   Blockade is one answer offered by experts. 
In it they see a way to isolate Cuba, stop infiltration, maybe finish 
Castro, too.   This is the question now facing President 
Kennedy: How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to 
Communist infiltration of this hemisphere?   On April 25, the 
White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U&S& 
trade with Cuba was being considered. Its aim: To undermine further 
Cuba's economy. weaken Castro.   Another strategy- bolder 
and tougher- was also attracting notice in Washington: a naval 
and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world, destroy Castro.

Blockade, in the view of military and civilian experts, could restore 
teeth to the Monroe Doctrine. It could halt a flood of Communist 
arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro. It could stop 
Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America. 
It would be the most severe reprisal, short of declared war, that the 
United States could invoke against Castro.   It is the strategy 
of blockade, therefore, that is suddenly at the center of attention 
of administration officials, Members of Congress, officers in the 
Pentagon. As a possible course of action, it also is the center of 
debate and is raising many questions. Among these questions: _WHAT 
WOULD 
A CUBA BLOCKADE TAKE?_ Military experts say a tight naval blockade 
off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require 
two naval task forces, each built around an aircraft carrier with 
a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers.   The 
Navy, on April 25, announced it is bringing back the carrier <Shangri-La> 
from the Mediterranean, increasing to four the number of 
attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba. More than 36 other big Navy 
ships are no less than a day's sailing time away.   To round 
out the blockading force, submarines would be needed- to locate, identify 
and track approaching vessels. Land-based radar would help with 
this task. So would radar picket ships. A squadron of Navy jets and 
another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier 
task forces.   Three requirements go with a blockade: It must 
be proclaimed; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce 
it; and it must be enforced without discrimination.   Once 
these conditions of international law are met, countries that try to 
run to blockade do so at their own risk. Blockade runners can be stopped- 
by gunfire, if necessary- searched and held, at least temporarily. 
They could be sent to U&S& ports for rulings whether cargo 
should be confiscated. _WHAT COULD A BLOCKADE ACCOMPLISH?_ Plenty, 
say the experts. In a broad sense, it would reaffirm the Monroe 
Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere. 
It could, by avoiding direct intervention, provide a short-of-war 
strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration.   Primary target 
would be shipments of tanks, guns, aviation gasoline and ammunition 
coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia. Shipments of arms from Western 
countries could similarly be seized as contraband. In a total blockade, 
action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals, 
oils, textiles, and even foodstuffs. At times, three ships a day from 
the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports. 
From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236, 66th 
Congress, the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been 
to assist the States, by means of grants-in-aid, to return disabled 
men and women to productive, gainful employment. The authority for 
the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation 
program was made permanent as Title /5, of the Social Security 
Act in 1935. Up to this time and for the next eight years, the services 
provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training, counseling, 
and placement on a job. Recognizing the limitations of such a program, 
the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P& L& 113, which broadened 
the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical 
restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities, and which revised 
the financing structure. _RECENT CHANGES._ Despite the successful 
rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first 
eleven years after 1943, the existing program was still seen to be 
inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million 
disabled. To assist the States, therefore, in rehabilitating handicapped 
individuals, "so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative 
employment to the extent of their capabilities", the 83rd 
Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 
(P& L& 565). These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation 
Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation 
facilities, for more sheltered and "half-way" workshops, for 
greater numbers of adequately trained personnel, for more comprehensive 
services to individuals (particularly to the homebound and the blind), 
and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's 
overall effectiveness. _FINANCIAL ASPECTS._ Under the law as it 
existed until 1943, the Federal Government made grants to the States 
on the basis of population, matching State expenditures on a 50-50 
basis. Under P& L& 113, 78th Congress, the Federal Government 
assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures 
in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of 
the disabled, and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients 
with rehabilitation case services. Throughout these years, the statutory 
authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out 
the provisions of the Act.   The 1954 Amendments completely changed 
the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program, providing 
for a three-part grant structure- for (1) basic support; (2) extension 
and improvement; and (3) research, demonstrations, training and 
traineeships for vocational rehabilitation- and in addition for 
short-term training and instruction. The first part of the new structure- 
that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation 
services- is described in this Section. Subsequent sections 
on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure.

The following table shows, for selected years, the authorizations, 
appropriations, allotment base, Federal grants to States and State 
matching funds for this part of the grant program: 

#METHOD OF 
DISTRIBUTING FUNDS#

_DESCRIPTION OF FORMULA._ In order to assist 
the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services, Section 
2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for 
support of such services be based on (1) need, as measured by a State's 
population, and (2) fiscal capacity, as measured by its per capita 
income. The Act further provides for a "floor" or minimum allotment, 
set at the 1954 level, which is called the "base" allotment, 
and a "ceiling" or maximum allotment, for each State. It stipulates, 
in addition, that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing 
the "ceiling", 
and not used for insuring the "floor", be redistributed 
to those States still below their maximums. These provisions 
are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among 
the States, with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person 
have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in 
a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly 
populated State. The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption 
in State programs already in operation, which might otherwise result 
from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population 
alone. _METHOD OF COMPUTING ALLOTMENTS._ The method used in computing 
the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act. The term 
"State" means the several States, the District of Columbia, the 
Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico; the term "United States" 
includes the several States and the District of Columbia, and 
excludes the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico, and, prior 
to 
1962, Alaska and Hawaii. The following steps are employed in calculations: 
_1._ For each State (except Puerto Rico, Guam, the 
Virgin Islands, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii) determine 
average per capita income based on the last three years. (See <Source 
of Data>, below for per capita income data to be used in this step.) 
_2._ Determine the average per capita income for the U& S& 
based on the last three years. (See <Source of Data>, below, 
for per capita income data to be used in this step.) _3._ Determine 
the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U& S& 
(Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above.) _4._ Determine 
for each State (except the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto 
Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii) that percentage which 
bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per 
capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U& S&. 
(Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained 
for each State in item 1 above.) _5._ Determine the particular 
State's "allotment percentage". By law this is 75% for 
the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico. (Alaska and Hawaii had 
fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962.)

In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting 
from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above; <except> that no 
State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more 
than 75%. If the resulting difference for the particular State is 
less or more than these extremes, the State's allotment percentage 
must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme. _6._ Square 
each State's allotment percentage. _7._ Determine each State's 
population. (See <Source of Data>, below for population data 
to be used in this step.) _8._ Multiply the population of each 
State by the square of its allotment percentage. (Multiply result obtained 
in item 7 above, by result obtained in item 6 above.) _9._ 
Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above, for all the 
States. (For each State, make all computations set forth in items 
1 to 8 above, and then add the results obtained for each State in item 
8.) _10._ Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted 
is to the sum of the products for all the States. (Divide the amount 
being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above.) _11._ Determine 
the particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular 
fiscal year. (Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the 
result obtained in item 10 above.) _12._ Determine if the particular 
State's unadjusted allotment (result obtained in item 11 above) 
is greater than its maximum allotment, and if so lower its unadjusted 
allotment to its maximum allotment. (Each State's unadjusted allotment 
for any fiscal year, which exceeds its minimum allotment described 
in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times 
the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000, 
must be reduced by the amount of the excess.) _13._ Determine if 
the particular State's unadjusted allotment (result obtained in item 
11 above) is less than its minimum (base) allotment, and if so raise 
its unadjusted 
allotment to its minimum allotment. Regardless of its unadjusted 
allotment, each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment 
each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954- 
increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 
1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000. _14._ The funds 
recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used: first, to increase 
the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States 
where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment (item 
13 above); and second, to increase uniformly the allotments to those 
States whose allotments are below their maximums, with adjustments 
to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum. 
_ADDITIONAL NOTE ON ALLOTMENTS._ For the States which maintain 
two separate agencies- one for the vocational rehabilitation of 
the blind, and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the 
blind- the Act specifies that their minimum (base) allotment shall 
be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided 
in fiscal year 1954. Funds allotted in addition to their minimum 
allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine. 

#MATCHING REQUIREMENTS#

_EXPLANATION OF MATCHING FORMULA._ As 
is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational 
rehabilitation services, the matching requirements are also based on 
a statutory formula. Prior to 1960, in order to provide matching for 
the minimum (base) allotment, State funds had to equal 1954 State funds. 
Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched 
at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State, with a pivot 
of 40% State (or 60% Federal) participation in total program 
costs. The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any 
State is referred to in the law as that State's "Federal share". 
For purposes of this explanation, this percentage is referred to 
as the States "unadjusted Federal share". Beginning in 1960, the 
matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted (upward 
or downward, as required) 25% a year, so that by 1963 the entire 
support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State 
share, with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30%, respectively. 
The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect 
to any State's base allotment, as well as the adjusted rate in effect 
during the 1960-1962 period, is designated by the statute as that 
State's "adjusted Federal Share". The provisions for determining 
a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the 
varying financial resources among the States. The purpose of the adjusted 
Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition 
provisions 
for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent 
dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates. _METHOD OF COMPUTING 
FEDERAL SHARES._ The method used for computing the respective 
Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set 
forth in the Act. The term "State" means the several States, 
the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico; 
the term "United States" includes the several States and 
the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands, Guam 
and Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii. The following 
steps are employed in the calculations: _1._ For each State 
(except the Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, 
Alaska and Hawaii), determine the average per capita income for 
the last three years. (the same amount used in item 1 under <Method 
of Computing allotments>, above.) _2._ Determine the average 
per capita income for the United States for the last three years. (The 
same amount used in item 2 under <Method of Computing Allotments>, 
above.) _3._ Determine the ratio of 40% to the average per 
capita income of the United States. (Divide 40 by the amount used 
in item 2 above.) _4._ Determine for each State (except the Virgin 
Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and hawaii), 
that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular 
State's average per capita income bears to the average per 
capita income of the United States. (Multiply the result obtained 
in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above.) _5._ 
Determine the particular State's "Federal Share". By 
law this is 70% for the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico. 
(Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior 
to fiscal year 1962.)   In all other States it is the difference 
obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 
above; <except> 
that no State shall have a Federal share less than 
50% nor more than 70%. If the resulting difference for the particular 
State is less or more than these extremes, the State's Federal 
share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.

At the entrance side of the shelter, each roof beam is rested 
on the inside 4 inches of the block wall. The outside 4-inch space is 
filled by mortaring blocks on edge. The wooden bracing between the roof 
beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall. Mortar is poured 
between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the 
wall thickness for radiation shielding. (For details see inset, fig& 
5.)   The first one or two roof boards (marked "~E" in 
fig& 6) are slipped into place across the roof beams, from outside 
the shelter. These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up 
through the open space between the beams, from inside the shelter. Concrete 
blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards. The 
roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together. 
Work on the roof continues in this way. The last roof boards are covered 
with blocks from outside the shelter.   When the roof blocks 
are all in place, the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position. 
The structure is complete. (See fig& 7.) Building plans are 
on page 21.   Solid concrete blocks, relatively heavy and dense, 
are used for this shelter. These blocks are sold in various sizes 
so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit.   Solid blocks 
are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete 
to give effective protection.   Bricks are an alternative. 
If they are used, the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give 
the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks.   The 
illustrations in fig& 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall. More 
detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply 
houses and craftsmen. Other sources of information include the National 
Concrete Masonry Association, 38 South Dearborn Street, 
Chicago, Ill&, the Portland Cement Association, 33 West Grand 
Avenue, Chicago, Ill&, and the Structural Clay Products Association, 
Washington, D&C&. _ABOVEGROUND DOUBLE-WALL SHELTER_ 
An outdoor, aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete 
blocks. (See fig& 9, double-wall shelter.) Most people would 
have to hire a contractor to build this shelter. Plans are on pages 
22 and 23.   This shelter could be built in regions where water 
or rock is close to the surface, making it impractical to build an underground 
shelter.   Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed 
at least 20 inches apart. The space between them is filled with pit-run 
gravel or earth. The walls are held together with metal ties placed 
in the wet mortar as the walls are built.   The roof shown here 
(fig& 9) is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete, covered with at 
least 20 inches of pit-run gravel. An alternate roof, perhaps more 
within do-it-yourself reach, could be constructed of heavy wooden roof 
beams, overlaid with boards and waterproofing. It would have to be covered 
with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel.   The materials 
for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700. Contractors' charges 
would be additional. The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout 
protection. _PRE-SHAPED METAL SHELTER_ Pre-shaped corrugated 
metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either 
above or below ground. These are particularly suitable for regions where 
water or rock is close to the surface. They form effective fallout 
shelters when mounded over with earth, as shown in figure 10. 
Materials for this shelter would cost about $700. A contractor probably 
would be required to help build it. His charges would be added to 
the cost of materials. This shelter, as shown on page 24, would provide 
almost absolute protection from fallout radiation. An alternate 
hatchway entrance, shown on page 25, would reduce the cost of materials 
$50 to $100.   The National Lumber Manufacturers Association, 
Washington, D& C&, is developing plans to utilize specially 
treated lumber for underground shelter construction. The Structural 
Clay Products Institute, Washington, D&C&, is working to develop 
brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction. _UNDERGROUND 
CONCRETE SHELTER_ An underground reinforced concrete shelter 
can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500, depending 
on the type of entrance. The shelter shown would provide almost absolute 
fallout protection.   The illustration (fig& 11) shows this 
shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over. The same shelter 
could be built into an embankment or below ground level. Plans 
for the shelter, with either a stairway or hatchway entrance, are shown 
on pages 26 and 27.   Another type of shelter which gives excellent 
fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement 
of a home under construction. It would add about $500 to the total 
cost of the home. The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such 
a room built in a new home in the Washington, D&C& area in the 
Spring of 1959.   {IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS} common 
to each type of shelter are: _1._ Arrangement of the entrance. 
_2._ Ventilation. _3._ Radio reception. _4._ Lighting.

{THE ENTRANCE} must have at least one right-angle turn. 
Radiation scatters somewhat like light. Some will go around a corner. 
The rest continues in a straight line. Therefore, sharp turns 
in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter.

{VENTILATION} is provided in a concrete block basement 
shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance. A blower 
may be installed to increase comfort.   A blower is essential 
for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters. It should 
provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person. Vent 
pipes also are necessary (as shown in figs& 9, 10, and 11), but 
filters are not.   {RADIO RECEPTION} is cut down by the 
shielding necessary to keep out radiation. As soon as the shelter is 
completed a radio reception check must be made. It probably will be 
necessary to install an outside antenna, particularly to receive ~CONELRAD 
broadcasts.   {LIGHTING} is an important 
consideration. Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the 
shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere 
flashlight-type bulb. Tests have shown that such a device, 
with a fresh battery, will furnish light continuously for at least 
10 days. With a spare battery, a source of light for 2 weeks or more 
would be assured. A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available 
for those periods when a brighter light is needed. There should 
be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue 
in many areas.   {OTHER CONSIDERATIONS}.- If there 
are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter, 
they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix, page 29. Other basement 
windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens. Basement 
walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the 
Appendix, page 29.   In these shelters the entrance should be 
not more than 2 feet wide. Bunks, or materials to build them, may have 
to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed.

The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado 
or hurricane protection. #/3,. LIVING IN A SHELTER#

@ 
The 
radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first. <Forty-nine hours 
after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent 
of what it was an hour after the explosion. But the radiation may 
be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous>.

Therefore, civil defense instructions received over ~CONELRAD 
or by other means should be followed. A battery-powered 
radio is essential. Radiation instruments suitable for home use are 
available, and would be of value in locating that portion of the home 
which offers the best protection against fallout radiation. There is 
a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters 
may become available. One instrument thus would serve both purposes.

Your local civil defense will gather its own information and 
will receive broad information from State and Federal sources. It 
will tell you as soon as possible:   How long to stay in your 
shelter.   How soon you may go outdoors.   How long you 
may stay outside.   You should be prepared to stay in your shelter 
full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 
days or longer. A checklist in the Appendix, (page 30) tells what is 
needed. Families with children will have particular problems. They 
should provide for simple recreation.   There should be a task 
for everyone and these tasks should be rotated. Part of the family should 
be sleeping while the rest is awake.   To break the monotony 
it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy. 
Records such as diaries can be kept.   The survival of the family 
will depend largely on information received by radio. A record should 
be kept of the information and instructions, including the time and 
date of broadcast.   Family rationing probably will be necessary.

Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule. 
There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation 
has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement. However, as 
much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation 
exposure to a minimum.   The housekeeping problems of living 
in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied. Food, medical 
supplies, utensils, and equipment, if not already stored in the 
shelter, must be quickly gathered up and carried into it.   After 
the family has settled in the shelter, the housekeeping rules should 
be spelled out by the adult in charge.   Sanitation in the confines 
of the family shelter will require much thought and planning.

Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human 
wastes will be an unfamiliar problem. A covered container such as a kitchen 
garbage pail might do as a toilet. A 10-gallon garbage can, with 
a tightly fitting cover, could be used to keep the wastes until it 
is safe to leave the shelter.   Water rationing will be difficult 
and should be planned carefully.   A portable electric heater 
is advisable for shelters in cold climates. It would take the chill from 
the shelter in the beginning. Even if the electric power fails after 
an attack, any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter 
that much more comfortable. Body heat in the close quarters will 
help keep up the temperature. Warm clothing and bedding, of course, 
are essential.   Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided. 
A flame would use up air.   Some families already have held 
weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to 
determine for themselves what supplies they would need. #/4,. IF 
AN ATTACK FINDS YOU WITHOUT A PREPARED SHELTER#

@ Few areas, if any, 
are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about.

A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding 
from fallout radiation. On the ground floor the radiation would 
be about half what it is outside. The best protection would be on 
the ground floor in the central part of the house.   A belowground 
basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside 
level. The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows 
and deepest below ground.   If there is time after the warning, 
the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking 
windows with bricks, dirt, books, magazines, or other heavy material. 
#/5,. SHELTER IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS#

@ Large apartment buildings 
of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual 
family dwellings. In general, such apartments afford more protection 
than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is 
more space.   The central area of the ground floor of a heavily 
constructed apartment building, with concrete floors, should provide 
more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling. 
The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural 
protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended 
for the basement of a family dwelling.   The Federal 
Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential, 
commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout 
protection they would provide, and for how many people.   The 
problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use 
of existing space. Such planning will require the cooperation of other 
occupants and of the apartment management.

A former du Pont official became a General Motors vice president 
and set about maximizing du Pont's share of the General Motors 
market. Lines of communications were established between the two 
companies and several du Pont products were actively promoted. Within 
a few years various du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire 
requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating 
divisions. The Fisher Body division, long controlled by the 
Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned 
a majority of its stock, followed an independent course for many years, 
but by 1947 and 1948 "resistance had collapsed" and its purchases 
from du Pont "compared favorably" with purchases by other General 
Motors divisions. Competitors came to receive higher percentage 
of General Motors business in later years, but it is "likely" 
that this trend stemmed "at least in part" from the needs of General 
Motors outstripping du Pont's capacity. "  The fact 
that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du Pont's 
production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements 
of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du Pont 
by a stock interest. The inference is overwhelming that du Pont's 
commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained 
solely on competitive merit". 353 U& S&, at 605. 
This Court agreed with the trial court "that considerations of price, 
quality and service were not overlooked by either du Pont or General 
Motors". 353 U& S&, at 606. However, it determined that 
neither this factor, nor "the fact that all concerned in high executive 
posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly, each in the 
honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own 
company and without any design to overreach anyone, including du Pont's 
competitors", 353 U& S&, at 607, outweighed the Government's 
claim for relief. This claim, as submitted to the District 
Court and dismissed by it, 126 F&Supp&235, alleged violation 
not only of @ 7 of the Clayton Act, but also of @ @ 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act. The latter provisions proscribe any contract, combination, 
or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade, and 
monopolization of, or attempts, combinations, or conspiracies to monopolize, 
such trade. However, this Court put to one side without consideration 
the Government's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman 
Act allegations. It rested its decision solely on @ 7, which reads 
in pertinent part: "  [N]o corporation engaged in commerce 
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of 
the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in 
commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially 
lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired 
and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce 
in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any 
line of commerce. @   This section shall not apply to corporations 
purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same 
by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, 
the substantial lessening of competition **h".   The purpose 
of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion: 
"  Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only 
the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation 
of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation, 
but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies 
in a relevant market which, as a reasonable probability, appear at the 
time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation 
of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation. The section 
is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies, or the substantial 
lessening of competition, have occurred or are intended **h". 
353 U& S&, at 589.   Thus, a finding of conspiracy to 
restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's 
decision. Indeed, as already noted, the Court proceeded on the assumption 
that the executives involved in the dealings between du Pont 
and General Motors acted "honorably and fairly" and exercised 
their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests 
of their own companies. This, however, did not bar finding that du 
Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and 
finishes to General Motors; that these products constituted a "line 
of commerce" within the meaning of the Clayton Act; that General 
Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial; 
and that competition for this share of the market was endangered 
by the financial relationship between the two concerns: "  The 
statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered 
when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition 
of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned 
by the statute. We repeat, that the test of a violation of @ 7 is 
whether, at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability that 
the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints. The 
conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved 
as to this acquisition **h". 353 U& S&, at 607.   On 
the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion, the Court remanded 
the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate 
relief. The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed 
to it was this: "  The judgment must therefore be reversed 
and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination, 
after further hearing, of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate 
in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition 
offensive to the statute. The District Courts, in the framing 
of equitable decrees, are clothed 'with large discretion to model 
their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case'. <International 
Salt Co&> 
v& <United States,> 332 U& S& 392, 
400-401". 353 U& S&, at 607-608.   This brings us to the 
course of the proceedings in the District Court. #/2,.#

This 
Court's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18, 
1957. The first pretrial conference- held to appoint <amici curiae> 
to represent the interest of the stockholders of du Pont and General 
Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent 
hearings- took place on September 25, 1957. At the outset, the 
Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government 
and for du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view 
to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court. 
Du Pont, he said, had proposed disenfranchisement of its General 
Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du Pont-General 
Motors relationship. The Government, deeming these suggestions inadequate, 
had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du Pont's 
shares of General Motors. Counsel for the Government invited 
du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program, 
but stated that if the court desired, or if counsel for du Pont 
thought further discussion would not be profitable, the Government 
was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days.   Counsel for 
du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by 
both sides at an early date. No previous antitrust case, he said, had 
involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems 
of relief. The submission of detailed plans would place the issues 
before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture 
or disenfranchisement in the abstract. The Court adopted this procedure 
with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out.   The 
Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25, 1957. The 
plan called for divestiture by du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General 
Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders, 
as a dividend, over a period of ten years. Christiana Securities Company 
and Delaware Realty + Investment Company, major stockholders 
in du Pont, and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially 
by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee, again over 
a ten-year period, of du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to 
them, as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware 
owned outright. If, in the trustee's judgment, "reasonable 
market conditions" did not prevail during any given year, he was to 
be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the 
ten-year period. In addition, the right to vote the General Motors 
stock held by du Pont was to be vested in du Pont's stockholders, 
other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware; 
du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring 
stock in or exercising control over General Motors; du Pont, 
Christiana, and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director 
or officer in common with General Motors, and vice versa; and 
General Motors and du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement 
that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified 
percentage of its requirements of any du Pont manufactured product, 
or for the grant of exclusive patent rights, or for a grant by General 
Motors to du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any 
chemical discovery of General Motors, or for the maintenance of any 
joint commercial enterprise by the two companies.   On motion of 
the <amici 
curiae,> the court directed that a ruling be obtained from 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax 
consequences of the Government's plan. On May 9, 1958, the Commissioner 
announced his rulings. The annual dividends paid to du Pont 
stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary 
income to the extent of du Pont's earnings and profits. The 
measure, for federal income tax purposes, of the dividend to individual 
stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time 
of each annual distribution. In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders, 
the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value 
of the shares or du Pont's tax basis for them, which is approximately 
$2.09 per share. The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned 
by or allocable to Christiana, Delaware, and the stockholders of 
Delaware, and deposited with the trustee, would result in a tax to those 
parties at the capital gains rate.   Du Pont's counterproposal 
was filed on May 14, 1958. Under its plan du Pont would retain 
its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders 
the right to vote those shares. Christiana and Delaware would, 
in turn, be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors 
shares allocable to them to their own stockholders. Du Pont would 
be enjoined from having as a director, officer, or employee anyone 
who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors, and 
no director, officer, or employee of du Pont could serve as a director 
of General Motors without court approval. Du Pont would be denied 
the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except 
through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights 
to its stockholders.   On June 6, 1958, General Motors submitted 
its objections to the Government's proposal. It argued, <inter 
alia,> that a divestiture order would severely depress the market 
value of the stock of both General Motors and du Pont, with consequent 
serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent 
investors, among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions; 
that there would be a similar decline in the market values of 
other automotive and chemical stocks, with similar losses to the stockholders 
of those companies; that the tremendous volume of General 
Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts 
of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise 
equity capital; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect 
on the entire stock market and on general business activity. General 
Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would 
not be "in the public interest" as required by the mandate of this 
Court.   The decrees proposed by the <amici curiae> were filed 
in August of 1958. These plans, like du Pont's contained provisions 
for passing the vote on du Pont's General Motors shares on 
to the ultimate stockholders of du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, 
except that officers and directors of the three companies, their spouses, 
and other people living in their households, as well as other specified 
persons, were to be totally disenfranchised. Both plans also prohibited 
common directors, officers, or employees between du Pont, Christiana, 
and Delaware, on the one hand, and General Motors on the 
other. 
It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude "unnourished by sense" 
to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such 
a risk, or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger 
the confidentiality of the marriage relationship. While it is easy 
enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas of the Crown 
from a metaphysical point of view, the concept of the "oneness" 
of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between 
husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be 
regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage. 
By 
making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which 
Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship, the Court today 
continues in the path charted by the recent decision in <Wyatt> 
v& <United States>, 362 U&S& 525, where the Court held that, 
under the circumstances of that case, a wife could be compelled to 
testify against her husband over her objection. One need not waver in 
his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other 
things in American life which are also of great importance, and to which 
even law enforcement must accommodate itself. One of these is the 
solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage. The Court's 
opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine 
does not in fact protect this relationship, and that hence the doctrine 
"enthrone[s] an unreality into a rule of law". I am not 
easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries 
can be so lightly dismissed. But in any event, I submit that 
the power to depose belongs to Congress, not to this Court. I dissent. 
Petitioner, who claims to be a conscientious objector, was convicted 
of violating @ 12 (a) of the Universal Military Training and Service 
Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces. He claims 
that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, 
because (1) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department 
of Justice, he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed 
to him by the local board, and (2) at the trial, he was denied the right 
to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim. <Held>: 
On the record in this case, the administrative procedures prescribed 
by the Act were fully complied with; petitioner was not denied due 
process; and his conviction is sustained. Pp& 60-66. _(A)_ Petitioner 
was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings, 
because the statement in question was in his file, to which he had access, 
and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer 
of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board. Pp& 
62-63. _(B)_ 
Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's 
notes and report, especially since he failed to show any particular 
need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's 
recommendation to the appeal board. Pp& 63-64. _(C)_ 
Petitioner was not entitled, either in the administrative hearing at 
the Department of Justice or at his trial, to inspect the original report 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, since he was furnished 
a resume of it, did not challenge its accuracy, and showed no particular 
need for the original report. Pp& 64-66.   <Haydn C& 
Covington> argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.

<Daniel M& Friedman> argued the cause for the United States. 
On the brief were <Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney 
General Wilkey, Beatrice Rosenberg> and <J& F& Bishop>.

MR& JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the 
armed services, in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military 
Training and Service Act, 62 Stat& 604, 622, 50 U&S&C& 
App& @ 462 (a). Petitioner, who claims to be a conscientious 
objector, contends that he was denied due process, both in the proceedings 
before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at 
trial. He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing 
officer statements attributed to him by the local board, and, further, 
that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice 
hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation as to his claim- all in violation of the 
Fifth Amendment. The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures 
of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require 
the production of such documents. Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced 
to 15 months' imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
269 F& 2d 613. We granted certiorari in view of the importance of 
the questions in the administration of the Act. 361 U& S& 899. 
We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale 
of <gonzales> v& <United States>, 348 U&S& 407 
(1955), 
and <United States> v& <Nugent>, 346 U&S& 1 (1953), 
and therefore affirm the judgment.   Petitioner registered with 
Local Board No& 9, Boulder, Colorado, on March 17, 1952. His 
answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a 
minister of Jehovah's Witnesses, employed at night by a sugar producer. 
He claimed /4,-~D classification as a minister of religion, 
devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching. On November 
13, 1952, he was classified in Class /1,-~A. On November 22, 
1952, he wrote the Board, protesting this classification. He again stated 
that he was "a regular minister"; that he was "devoting 
an average 
of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly", in addition to 
50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties, and that he opposed war in 
any form. Thereafter he was classified /1,-~O. On April 1, 1953, 
after some six months of full-time "pioneering", petitioner discontinued 
devoting 100 hours a month to preaching, but failed to so 
notify his local board. In a periodic review, the local board on July 
30, 1953, reclassified him /1,-~A and upheld this classification 
after a personal appearance by petitioner, because of his willingness 
to kill in defense of his church and home. Upon administrative approval 
of the reclassification, he was ordered to report for induction on 
June 11, 1956, but failed to do so. He was not prosecuted, however, 
and his case was subsequently reopened, in the light of <Sicurella> 
v& <United States>, 348 U&S& 385 (1955). He was again 
reclassified /1,-~A by the local board. There followed a customary 
Department of Justice hearing, at which petitioner appeared. In 
his report to the Attorney General, the hearing officer suggested that 
the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service. 
On March 21, 1957, however, the Department recommended approval of 
the /1,-~A classification. Its ground for this recommendation was 
that, while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17, 1956 
(as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date), that he 
was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching, the headquarters 
of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so 
and, on the contrary, had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible 
Student Servant positions. It reported that he now devoted only some 
6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per 
month to church activities. His claim was therefore "so highly exaggerated", 
the Department concluded, that it "cast doubt upon his 
veracity and, consequently, upon his sincerity and good faith". The 
appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation. In 
his answer thereto, he advised the Board that he had made no such statement 
in 1956, and asserted that his only claim to "pioneering" 
was in 1952. The appeal board, however, unanimously concurred in the 
Department's recommendation. Upon return of the file to the local 
board, petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this 
prosecution followed his failure to do so.   Petitioner first contends 
that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving 
him timely opportunity, before its final recommendation to the appeal 
board, to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim 
of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching. But the statement of the 
local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file. He 
admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times, and he could have 
rebutted it before the hearing officer. This he failed to do, asserting 
that he did not know it to be in his file. Apparently he never 
took the trouble to find out. Nevertheless he had ample opportunity 
to contest the statement before the appeal board. After the recommendation 
of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board, that is the 
appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial. This he did. 
We found in <Gonzales> v& <United States, supra>, that this 
was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be 
furnished a registrant. We said there that it was necessary "that 
a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut [the Department's] 
recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board, the agency with the 
ultimate responsibility for classification". 348 U&S&, at 412. 
We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's 
contention, which was considered by the appeal board and 
denied by it. As was said in <Gonzales>, "it is the Appeal Board 
which renders the selective service determination considered 'final' 
in the courts, not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact. 
<Estep> v& <United States>, 327 U&S& 114". 348 
U& 
S&, at 412-413.   But there are other contentions which might 
be considered more difficult. At his trial, petitioner sought to secure 
through subpoena <duces tecum> the longhand notes of the Department's 
hearing officer, Evensen, as well as his report thereon. Petitioner 
also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal 
Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice. 
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld; nor 
did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation reports might disclose.   Section 6 (~j) of the 
Act, 
as we have held, does require the Department's recommendation to 
be placed in a registrant's file. <Gonzales> v& <United States, 
supra>. But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing 
officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant. While 
the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report 
be placed in the registrant's file, this requirement was eliminated 
in 1952. Moreover, the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental, 
is directed to the Attorney General and, of course, is not 
the recommendation of the Department. It is not essentially different 
from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice, of 
which the Attorney General receives many, and to which he may give 
his approval or rejection. It is but part of the whole process within 
the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation 
to the appeal board.   It is also significant that neither this 
report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal 
board. Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only 
conclusions of the Department on file with the Board. Petitioner 
knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing 
officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his 
file. Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local 
board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board, petitioner 
cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed.

It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the 
production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial. 
In addition, petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the 
report and notes. While there are now allegations of the withholding 
of "favorable evidence developed at the hearing" and a denial of 
a "full and fair hearing", no such claim was made by petitioner at 
any stage of the administrative process. Moreover, his testimony at 
trial never developed any such facts. In the light of these circumstances, 
as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered 
entirely on the Department's recommendation, which petitioner 
repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found 
supported by the record, we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's 
report and notes.   Finally petitioner says that he was entitled 
to inspect the ~FBI report during the proceedings before the 
hearing officer as well as at the trial. He did receive a resume of 
it- the same that was furnished the appeal board- and he made no 
claim of its inaccuracy. Even now no such claim is asserted. He bases 
his present contention on the general right to explore, indicating that 
he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume. But this is fully 
answered by <United States> v& <Nugent, supra>. There we held 
"that the statutory scheme for review, within the selective service 
system, **h entitles [conscientious objectors] to no guarantee 
that 
the ~FBI reports must be produced for their inspection". 346 
U&S&, at 5-6. Even if we were not bound by <Nugent>, petitioner 
here would not be entitled to the report. The recommendation of 
the Department- as well as the decision of the appeal board- was 
based entirely on the local board file, not on an ~FBI report. 

#FOREIGN POLICY IN ITS TOTAL CONTEXT#

With this enlarged role in 
mind, I should like to make a few suggestions: What we in the United 
States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what 
happens in the rest of the world. We in this Department must think about 
foreign policy in its total context. We cannot regard foreign policy 
as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal 
policy has been extracted. Foreign policy is the total involvement 
of the American people with peoples and governments abroad. That 
means that, if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership, we must 
think in terms of the total context of our situation. It is the concern 
of the Department of State that the American people are safe and 
secure- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense. 
It is also the concern of the Department of State that our 
trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous, profitable, 
and active- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of 
concern only to the Department of Commerce. We can no longer rely on 
interdepartmental machinery "somewhere upstairs" to resolve differences 
between this and other departments. Assistant Secretaries of 
State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination 
of policies. Means must be found to enable us to keep in 
touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues 
in other departments concerned with foreign policy.   I think we 
need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action. Every 
policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer. Unless we keep 
our eyes on the horizon ahead, we shall fail to bring ourselves on target 
with the present. The movement of events is so fast, the pace so 
severe, that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are 
to think accurately about the present. If there is anything which we 
can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes 
by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act 
promptly, that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct 
of our affairs. Action taken today is often far more valuable than action 
taken several months later in response to a situation then out of 
control.   There will of course be times for delay and inaction. 
What I am suggesting is that when we delay, or when we fail to act, 
we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic 
or procedural difficulties.   I also hope that we can 
do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas- an affliction 
of all bureaucracies. We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom 
to the top of the Department. We want to make sure that our junior 
colleagues realize that ideas are welcome, that initiative goes right 
down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top. I hope no one 
expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources 
of ideas. The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating 
ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function, 
regardless of rank.   Further, I would hope that we could 
pay attention to little things. While observing the operations of 
our Government in various parts of the world, I have felt that in many 
situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor 
problems which spoiled our main effort. To cite only a few examples: 
The wrong man in the wrong position, perhaps even in a junior 
position 
abroad, can be a source of great harm to our policy; the attitudes 
of a U&N& delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate 
housing in New York City, or of a foreign diplomat in similar 
circumstances in our Capital, can be easily be directed against the United 
States and all that it stands for. Dozens of seemingly small 
matters go wrong all over the world. Sometimes those who know about them 
are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them. I 
would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and 
overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the 
responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can 
do something about them.   If the Department of State is to take 
primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington, it follows 
that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas. This does 
not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active, operational, 
interested, responsible fashion. He is expected to know about what 
is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed 
in his country. He is expected to supervise, to encourage, to direct, 
to assist in any way he can. If any official operation abroad begins 
to go wrong, we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and 
to get suggestions for remedial action. 

#THE PROBLEMS OF A POLICY OFFICER# 

It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts 
which I expressed privately in recent years, in the hope of clearing 
up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy 
is all about and what it means, and of developing a certain compassion 
for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government. 
I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems 
that a senior departmental policy officer faces. This means practically 
everybody in this room. Whether it will strike home for you or not 
will be for you to determine.   The senior policy officer may 
be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of 
stimuli: an idea in his own head, the suggestions of a colleague, 
a question from the Secretary or the President, a proposal by another 
department, a communication from a foreign government or an American 
ambassador abroad, the filing of an item for the agenda of the United 
Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies, a news 
item read at the breakfast table, a question to the President or the 
Secretary at a news conference, a speech by a Senator or Congressman, 
an article in a periodical, a resolution from a national organization, 
a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad, 
et cetera, ad infinitum. The policy officer lives with his antennae 
alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility.

His first thought is about the question itself: Is 
there a question here for American foreign policy, and, if so, what is 
it? For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job 
is to know what the question is- that when it is accurately identified 
it sometimes answers itself, and that the way in which it is posed 
frequently shapes the answer.   Chewing it over with his colleagues 
and in his own mind, he reaches a tentative identification of the 
question- tentative because it may change as he explores it further 
and because, if no tolerable answer can be found, it may have to be changed 
into one which can be answered.   Meanwhile he has been thinking 
about the facts surrounding the problem, facts which he knows can 
never be complete, and the general background, much of which has already 
been lost to history. He is appreciative of the expert help available 
to him and draws these resources into play, taking care to examine 
at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently 
policy-oriented conclusions. He knows that he must give the expert his 
place, but he knows that he must also keep him in it.   He is 
already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action, 
including doing nothing. He knows that he is thinking about action in 
relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful 
fog. But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy, 
well-established precedents, the commitments of the United States 
under international charters and treaties, basic statutes, and well-understood 
notions of the American people about how we are to conduct 
ourselves, in policy literature such as country papers and National Security 
Council papers accumulated in the Department.   He will 
not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting 
results in the factual situation with which he is confronted. He must 
think about which of these principles must take precedence. He will 
know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his 
problem because of crucial changes in circumstance. He is aware that 
every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other 
problem. He must deal with the question of how to manage a part 
when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole- when the whole 
is too large to grasp.   He must think of others who have a 
stake in the question and in its answer. Who should be consulted among 
his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies 
of the Government? Which American ambassadors could provide helpful 
advice? Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted? 
What is the probable attitude of other governments, including 
those less directly involved? How and at what stage and in what sequence 
are other governments to be consulted?   If action is indicated, 
what kind of action is relevant to the problem? The selection 
of the wrong tools can mean waste, at best, and at worst an unwanted 
inflammation of the problem itself. Can the President or the Secretary 
act under existing authority, or will new legislation and new money 
be required? Should the action be unilateral or multilateral? 
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international 
body? For, if so, the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary 
diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem. 

#RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS OF MANKIND#

What type of action can 
hope to win public support, first in this country and then abroad? 
For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret 
and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned 
by the readiness of the country to sustain it. He is interested in 
public opinion for two reasons: first, because it is important in itself, 
and, second, because he knows that the American public cares about 
a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. And, given probable 
public attitudes- about which reasonably good estimates can be made- 
what action is called for to insure necessary support?   May 
I add a caution on this particular point? We do not want policy 
officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves 
too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign 
policy action. In the first place our business is foreign policy, 
and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees 
in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of 
a problem. Mr& Truman emphasized this point by saying, "You fellows 
in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics".

This is an important consideration. If we sit here 
reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports 
that cross our desks, we should realize that this is raw, undigested 
opinion expressed in the absence of leadership. What the American 
people will do turns in large degree on their leadership. We cannot 
test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country 
have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them 
for support for the necessary action. I doubt, for example, that, 
3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the 
Marshall plan, any public-opinion expert would have said that the country 
would have accepted such proposals.   The problem in the 
policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly 
complicated factors- political, military, economic, financial, legal, 
legislative, procedural, administrative- to be sorted out and handled 
within a political system which moves by consent in relation to 
an external environment which cannot be under control.   And the 
policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels.

While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one 
sex, there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and 
some open only to men or to women. The Peace Corps should not pay 
the expenses of a wife or family, unless the wife is also accepted for 
full-time Peace Corps work on the same project.   There should 
be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service. In most cases 
service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary 
deferment.   Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not 
be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United 
States. Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in 
health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid. 
The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation 
for individual services.   Rather the principle should be akin 
to that of the allowance. Peace Corps volunteers should be given 
just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living. They should 
live in modest circumstances, avoiding all conspicuous consumption. 
Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts. 
Some special health requirements might have to be met. For example, 
it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to 
pay medical expenses of volunteers. Perhaps existing Public Health 
Service, State Department and Armed Services medical facilities 
can be utilized.   For readjustment to the U&S&, volunteers 
should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas 
service, based on the length of time served. 

#7. IN WHAT PART OF 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD THE PEACE CORPS BE ESTABLISHED?#

The idea 
of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people. 
Support for it cuts across party, regional, ethnic and other lines. 
The Peace Corps, therefore, offers an opportunity to add a new dimension 
to our approach to the world- an opportunity for the American 
people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world 
development.   For this, the Peace Corps should be administered 
by a small, new, alive agency operating as one component in our whole 
overseas operation.   Pending the reorganization of our foreign 
aid structure and program, the Peace Corps should be established 
as an agency in the Department of State. When the aid operations are 
reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous, functional 
unit. Meanwhile, the Peace Corps could be physically located 
in ~ICA's facilities and depend on the State Department and 
~ICA for administrative support and, when needed, program assistance.

In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own 
identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those 
now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas 
operations. 

#8. HOW AND WHEN SHOULD THE PEACE CORPS BE LAUNCHED?# 

The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear, with only preparatory 
work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates 
special funds for it- or it can be launched now and in earnest 
by executive action, with sufficient funds and made available from 
existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial 
projects to start this summer.   The Peace Corps should 
be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified 
people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost. Nor 
should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university 
campuses.   If launched in a careful but determined way within 
the next few weeks, the Peace Corps could have several hundred 
persons in training this summer for placement next Fall. Within a year 
or two several thousand might be in service. It can then grow steadily 
as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated.

WHAT WOULD THE FIRST PROJECTS BE?#

In the first year there should 
probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects. The need here 
is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified 
volunteers in a short period of time is greatest.   There would, 
however, be a variety of other skills- medical, agricultural, engineering- 
which would be called for in the first year through the private 
agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers 
to existing development projects.   The first year's projects 
should also be spread through several countries in Latin America, 
Africa and Asia. 

#10. HOW WILL THE PEACE CORPS BE RECEIVED ABROAD?# 

Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every 
newly developing nation, the readiness to receive such manpower, or to 
receive it from the United States will vary from country to country. 
A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected 
in many quarters. Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything 
in their power to promote active hostility. But there are indications 
that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers, 
and that if the volunteers are well chosen, they will soon demonstrate 
their value and make many friends.   It is important, however, 
that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War 
but as a contribution to the world community. In presenting it to 
other governments and to the United Nations, we could propose that 
every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the 
United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating 
committee. We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly 
international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside 
citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands. 
In any case, our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician 
helpers in development projects of the U&N& and other international 
agencies.   The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or 
propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership. 
Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach. The Peace Corps 
offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems 
of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country 
needs for trained manpower. If presented in this spirit, the response 
and the results will be immeasurably better. 

#11. HOW WILL IT BE 
FINANCED?#

The already appropriated funds within the discretion of 
the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security 
Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's 
pilot programs of the Peace Corps. If it is decided to make a 
small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance 
funds, in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security 
Act through this new peaceful program, this will be a hopeful sign 
to the world. Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps 
a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year.   Specifically, 
Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive 
contributions from American businesses, unions, civic organizations 
and the public at large. For this must be the project of the whole 
American people. An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures 
with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program 
continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding.

Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace 
Program with the Peace Corps, so that foreign currencies accumulated 
by the sale of U&S& surplus food under P&L& 480 can be 
put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps 
personnel.   The extent to which participating bodies such as U& 
S& voluntary agencies, universities, international organizations, 
and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should 
share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored. 

#12. IS IT WORTH THE COST AND THE RISKS?#

No matter how well 
conceived and efficiently run, there probably will be failures. These 
could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad.

But as the popular response suggests, the potentiality of the 
Peace Corps is very great. It can contribute to the development of 
critical countries and regions. It can promote international cooperation 
and good will toward this country. It can also contribute to the 
education of America and to more intelligent American participation 
in the world.   With thousands of young Americans going to work 
in developing areas, millions of Americans will become more directly 
involved in the world than ever before.   With colleges and universities 
carrying a large part of the program, and with students looking 
toward Peace Corps service, there will be an impact on educational 
curriculum and student seriousness. The letters home, the talks later 
given by returning members of the Peace Corps, the influence on 
the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad- 
all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible 
American policies toward the world. And this is meeting the world's 
need, too, since what the world most needs from this country 
is better understanding of the world.   The Peace Corps thus can 
add a new dimension to America's world policy- one for which people 
here and abroad have long been waiting. As you said in your State 
of the Union message. "The problems **h are towering and unprecedented- 
and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well". 

#TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:#

I recommend to the Congress 
the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps- <a pool of trained 
American men and women sent overseas by the U&S& Government 
or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign 
countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower>.   I 
have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on 
a temporary pilot basis.   The temporary Peace Corps will be 
a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more 
effective plans for a permanent organization. In addition, by starting 
the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and 
women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them 
in overseas positions by late fall. This temporary Peace Corps is 
being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security 
Act and will be located in the Department of State. Its initial expenses 
will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign 
aid program.   Throughout the world the people of the newly 
developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which 
reflects their deepest desires. Our own freedom, and the future 
of freedom around the world, depend, in a very real sense, on their ability 
to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity, 
liberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance and poverty.

One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is 
the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and 
assist in the operation of development projects- men and women with 
the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics, 
and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages, 
the mountains, the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations.

The vast task of economic development urgently requires 
skilled people to do the work of the society- to help teach in the 
schools, construct development projects, demonstrate modern methods of 
sanitation in the villages, and perform a hundred other tasks calling 
for training and advanced knowledge.   To meet this urgent need 
for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace 
Corps- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers, 
sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations.

This organization will differ from existing assistance programs 
in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the 
specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical 
advice to work. They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary 
to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments, 
acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice. 
There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve 
will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them. 
_WILDLIFE HABITAT RESOURCES_ In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million 
recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for 
the primary purpose of hunting and fishing. Hunter and fisherman visits 
since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale 
of hunting and fishing licenses. This use is expected to increase to 
about 50 million visits by 1972. The long-range objective of habitat 
management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and 
game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment.

The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period 
are: _1._ Revise and complete wildlife habitat management 
and improvement plans for all administrative units, assuring proper coordination 
between wildlife habitat management and other resources. _2._ 
Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation 
with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National 
Forests and Grasslands are located, as a basis for orderly development 
of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs, including 
(a) big-game, gamebird, and small-game habitat surveys and investigations 
on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands, 
(b) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles 
of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes 
and impoundments, and (c) participation in planning, inspection, and 
control phases of all habitat improvement, land- and water-use projects 
conducted on National Forest lands by States, other Federal agencies, 
and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife 
and be in harmony with other resource values. _3._ Improve food 
and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas. _4._ Develop 
wildlife openings, food patches, and game ways in dense vegetation 
by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres. _5._ Improve 
7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing 
banks, planting streamside cover, and constructing channel improvements. 

#PROTECTION#

The total adverse impact of disease, insects, 
fire, weather, destructive animals, and other forces on the uses and 
values of forest resources is not generally recognized. They kill and 
destroy, retard or prevent reproduction and growth, impair and damage 
values, and disrupt uses.   The loss in growth of sawtimber because 
of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 
was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet. If it were not for the 
effect of destructive agencies, sawtimber growth would have been nearly 
twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952. About 45 percent 
of the loss in growth was attributable to disease, 20 percent to 
insects, 17 percent to fire, and 18 percent to weather, animals, and 
various other causes.   These destructive forces also have a seriously 
adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows, 
and upon the other renewable forest resources.   The long-range 
objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below 
the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management 
of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and 
high-level sustained yield of products and services. This can be accomplished 
substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities 
and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical 
fire periods, and a more intensive application of a program of prevention, 
detection, and control of insect and disease infestations. In 
addition to direct protection measures, more intensive management of 
timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and 
disease. _PROTECTION FROM INSECTS AND DISEASE_ In the 10-year period, 
it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest 
System be stepped up to a level of prevention, detection, and 
control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce 
the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial 
period. This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present 
level of protection. The work will consist of: _1._ Intensification 
of present activities through (a) quicker, more extensive, and 
more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks; (b) more reliable 
evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread 
damage; (c) quicker and more effective control action in the initial 
stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic. The initial suppression 
activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated. 
_2._ Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension 
of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should 
be managed for white pine production. The objective is to achieve sufficient 
effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment 
plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance 
control will be needed. _3._ Initiating a program to control 
dwarfmistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better 
stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites. _4._ 
Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities 
to reduce losses. _PROTECTION FROM FIRE_ It is proposed 
that in 
10 years all commercial timberlands, all critical watersheds, and 
other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for 
intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the 
fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads. This 
will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving 
such protection. An additional 15 million acres will be given 
a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation.

Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for: 
_1._ Expansion, modernization, and development of fire control 
to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many 
fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted 
standards. This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present 
level of preventive effort, detection, skilled fire-fighting crews, 
and equipment use. This will include a stepped-up program of training 
and development of personnel. _2._ Adoption and use of new and 
modern techniques being developed for prevention, for suppression of fires 
while small, and for stopping large fires while running and burning 
intensely. _3._ Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize 
the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value 
areas. This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land 
needing such treatment, and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly 
hazardous debris concentration, felling snags on 350,000 acres of 
high lightning-occurrence areas, prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres, 
removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres, and clearing and maintaining 
11,000 miles of firebreaks. _PROTECTION FROM OTHER DAMAGE_ Rodent 
control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of 
the most serious infestations of harmful rodents, such as porcupines 
and mice, on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands. These 
areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation 
on the National Forests. Approximately 1.8 million acres of rangelands 
and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period. 
Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means 
of control are known. 

#ROADS AND TRAILS#

The transportation 
system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and 
access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions. 
This system is divided into a forest highway system, administered by 
the Secretary of Commerce, and a forest development road and trail system, 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Both of these 
systems are essential for the production, development, and use of the 
National 
Forests.   In the forest highway system, there are now 
24,400 miles of public roads. These are mostly through highways that 
carry traffic going from one destination to another. Because administration 
of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary 
of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties, 
this Development Program for the National Forests does not include 
estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system 
nor to construct the additions to its that are needed. It is estimated 
that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed 
to fully serve the National Forests.   In the forest development 
road and trail system, there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 
106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails. These roads are 
largely of less than highway standards, and usually carry traffic which 
is related to use of the National Forests. Construction and maintenance 
of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture. 
It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development 
roads, and 80,000 miles of trails, constitute the system that will eventually 
be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of 
the wood, water, forage, and wildlife and recreation resources of the 
National Forests on a continuing basis.   The ultimate trail system 
will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization 
and fire protection. It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum 
service to these important resources and watersheds.   The presence 
or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling 
influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as: 
_(A)_ the protection of forage, timber, and wildlife resources 
from fire, insects, and disease; _(B)_ the balanced use of recreation, 
hunting, and fishing areas; _(C)_ the volume of timber that 
can be marketed, especially for small sales and the support of dependent 
communities and small business enterprises; _(D)_ the level 
of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity 
to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire, windstorm, insects, 
and disease; _(E)_ the protection of watershed lands from erosion 
and overgrazing by animals.   The existence of road systems 
permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes 
that is not otherwise possible. Furthermore, roads that give 
access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own 
way over a period of years. Use of these roads by the public results 
in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve.   The 
long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain 
a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately 
service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected 
needs and optimum production of products and services. For the 
year 2000 this means servicing (a) the protection requirements of a watershed 
producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year, (b) 
recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors, 
(c) a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board 
feet, and (d) 60 million acres of rangelands.   Service at these 
levels of production and utilization will eventually require the 
construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new 
trails, along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 
miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails. About 26,500 miles 
of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of 
new roads. About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be 
met by the year 2000.   Program proposals for forest development 
roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows: 
_1._ Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 
miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails. This constitutes 
about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities.

Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on 
roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed 
by purchasers of National Forest timber, but paid for by 
the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices. _2._ Provide 
maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access 
roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during 
the period. 

#LAND ADJUSTMENT, LAND PURCHASE, LAND USE#

Within the 
units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership 
is quite irregular. In some units, National Forest ownership is well 
blocked together. In many others, the previous patenting of land 
under the public land laws, or the way in which land was available for 
purchase, resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership.   Within 
exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands, 
there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership. One consequence 
is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners 
of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring 
National Forest or other Federal land, or because such ownerships are 
developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public 
of neighboring National Forest land. Some privately held inholdings 
are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands. And some, which 
are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes, 
are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation, and are contributing 
nothing to the economy; there are no reasonable prospects 
that these conditions will be corrected or changed. Lands in this last 
category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern 
States.   The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation 
of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through 
purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts 
for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development, 
or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests 
and National Grasslands.

Strategy and tactics of the U&S& military forces are now 
undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history. The change of 
emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made 
with care, mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected 
in favor of the other. Our military forces must be capable of 
contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon 
us, from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war. 

#FORCES 
AND MILITARY PERSONNEL STRENGTH.#- This budget will provide in 
the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately 
the present level- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and 
women in the active forces. The forces to be supported include an Army 
of 14 divisions and 870,000 men; a Navy of 817 active ships and 
619,000 men; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 
men; and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men.

If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war, 
their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing 
character and missions of the active forces. Quality and combat readiness 
must take precedence over mere numbers. Under modern conditions, 
this is especially true of the ready reserve. I have requested the 
Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve 
components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light 
of the changing requirements of modern warfare.   Last year 
the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength 
limitations on the Army Reserve. Similar restrictions on the 
strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department 
of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped. I strongly 
recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on 
the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility 
to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity.   I again 
proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve- 
from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000, respectively, 
to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961. These 
strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions 
of the reserves in support of our national security objectives. 

#MILITARY PERSONNEL COSTS.#- About 30% of the expenditures for 
the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs, 
including pay for active, reserve, and retired military personnel. These 
expenditures are estimated to be $12.1 billion, an increase of $187 
million over 1960, reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel, 
more dependents, an increased number of men drawing proficiency 
pay, and social security tax increases (effective for the full year 
in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960). Retired pay costs are 
increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960, partly because of a substantial 
increase in the number of retired personnel. These increased costs 
are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures 
for the reserve forces, largely because of the planned reduction in strength 
of the Army Reserve components during 1961.   Traditionally, 
rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate 
to current rates of pay for active personnel. The 1958 military 
pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% 
increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior 
to its effective date of June 1, 1958. I endorse pending legislation 
that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and 
active duty pay rates. 

#OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.#- Expenditures 
for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed 
Forces are estimated to be $10.3 billion in 1961, which is $184 
million more than in 1960. The increase stems largely from the growing 
complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons 
and equipment.   A substantial increase is estimated in the 
cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense 
program, as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications 
are essential. Also, the program for fleet modernization 
will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures. Further 
increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted 
by the Congress last year.   Other factors increasing operating 
costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour, up 11% in two 
years, and of each steaming hour, up 15%. In total, these increases 
in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining 
programs and from economy measures, such as reduced numbers of units 
and installations, smaller inventories of major equipment, and improvements 
in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces.

In the budget message for 1959, and again for 1960, I recommended 
immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28, 1951 
(65 Stat& 365). This section prevents the military departments and 
the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain 
transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement 
with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House 
of Representatives. As I have stated previously, the Attorney 
General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional 
principles. Accordingly, if it is not repealed by the Congress 
at its present session, I shall have no alternative thereafter but 
to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless 
a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise.   Basic 
long-line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal 
facilities operated by the Army, Air Force, and Federal Aviation 
Agency. The growing communications needs of this new State can best 
be met, as they have in other States, through the operation and development 
of such facilities by private enterprise. Legislation has already 
been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned 
systems in Alaska, and its early enactment is desirable. 

#PROCUREMENT, 
RESEARCH, AND CONSTRUCTION.#- Approximately 45% of the expenditures 
for the Department of Defense are for procurement, research, 
development, and construction programs. In 1961, these expenditures 
are estimated at $18.9 billion, compared to $19.3 billion in 1960. The 
decreases, which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement, 
are offset in part by increases for research and development and 
for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks, vehicles, 
guns, and electronic devices. Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated 
at about the same level as in 1960.   New obligational authority 
for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement (excluding 
amounts for related research and construction) totals $4,753 
million, which is $1,390 million below that enacted for 1960. On the 
other hand, the new authority of $3,825 million proposed for missile 
procurement (excluding research and construction) in 1961 is $581 million 
higher than for 1960. These contrasting trends in procurement reflect 
the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed 
Forces in the years ahead.   The Department of Defense appropriation 
acts for the past several years have contained a rider which 
limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain 
military supply items. As I have repeatedly stated, this provision is 
much more restrictive than the general law, popularly known as the Buy 
American Act. I urge once again that the Congress not reenact 
this rider.   The task of providing a reasonable level of military 
strength, without endangering other vital aspects of our security, 
is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress. The 
last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances 
in military technology in history. Some weapons systems have 
become obsolescent while still in production, and some while still under 
development.   Furthermore, unexpectedly rapid progress or a 
technological break-through on any one weapon system, in itself, often 
diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems. This 
has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense 
program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important 
weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems 
which have been overtaken by events. Thus, in the last few years, a 
number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development 
was commenced have since been completely eliminated. For example, 
the importance of the Regulus /2,, a very promising aerodynamic 
ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines, 
was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more 
advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines.

Another example is the recent cancellation of the ~F-108, 
a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed 
of sound, which was designed for use against manned bombers in the 
period of the mid-1960's. The substantial progress being made in ballistic 
missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned 
bombers to missiles. Considering the high cost of the ~F-108 
system- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned- and 
the time period in which it would become operational, it was decided to 
stop further work on the project. Meanwhile, other air defense forces 
are being made effective, as described later in this message.

The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from 
earlier plans. Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor 
intermediate range ballistic missiles, which have been successfully developed, 
produced, and deployed, but the relative importance of which 
has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental 
ballistic missile.   The impact of technological factors 
is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program. 
This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for 
a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance 
aircraft, particularly our heavy bombers. Continuing technical 
problems involved in the use of this fuel, coupled with significant 
improvements in aircraft range through other means, have now raised serious 
questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program. As 
a result, the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed. 
These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations 
of new major development programs and even more penetrating and 
far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology. The 
cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the 
greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development, 
in determining the most satisfactory rate of development, and in 
deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production 
or to abandon it. 

#STRATEGIC FORCES.#- The deterrent power 
of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability 
and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any 
form of war. The first capability is represented by a combination 
of manned bombers, carrier-based aircraft, and intercontinental and intermediate 
range missiles. The second capability is represented by our 
deployed ground, naval, and air forces in essential forward areas, together 
with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement.

The Strategic Air Command is the principal element 
of our long-range nuclear capability. One of the important and difficult 
decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role 
of the ~B-70, a long-range supersonic bomber. This aircraft, which 
was planned for initial operational use about 1965, would be complementary 
to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile 
systems, all of which are scheduled to become available earlier. 
The first Atlas ~ICBM's are now operational, the first two 
Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year, 
and the first Titan ~ICBM's next year. The Minuteman solid-fueled 
~ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963. By 
1965, several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and 
their reliability established.   Thus, the need for the ~B-70 
as a strategic weapon system is doubtful. However, I am recommending 
that development work on the ~B-70 air-frame and engines be continued. 
It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available 
for flight testing. By that time we should be in a much better 
position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system.

I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version 
of the ~B-52 (the ~B-52~H with the new turbofan engine) 
and procurement of the ~B-58 supersonic medium bomber, together with 
the supporting refueling tankers in each case. These additional modern 
bombers will replace some of the older ~B-47 medium bombers; 
one ~B-52 can do the work of several ~B-47's which it will replace. 
Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping 
of the ~B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile.

In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas, Titan, 
and Polaris missiles also will be procured. 
Purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale 
and delivery of commodities, including the classes, types and/or varieties 
of food grain, the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees 
accruing 
from such sale, and other relevant matters. _3._ The United States 
recognizes the desire of India to accumulate, as quickly as possible, 
a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice 
provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal 
markets for this commodity in India. Under this Agreement the first 
annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960. 
At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of 
the United States supplies of rice available for Title /1, disposal, 
India's production, consumption and stocks of food grains, other 
imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United 
States, India's storage capacity, and other related factors, any 
increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed 
which is currently planned for procurement during the first year. _4._ 
The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations 
for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30, 1961, 
shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States 
Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available 
under Title /1, of the Act at that time. The United States Government 
shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales 
under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time 
after June 30, 1961, that such action is necessitated by the existence 
of an international emergency. 

#ARTICLE /2, USES OF RUPEES# 

_1._ The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government 
of the United States of America as a consequence of sales 
made pursuant to this Agreement will be used by the Government of 
the United States of America, in such manner and order of priority 
as the Government of the United States of America shall determine, 
for the following purposes in the amounts shown: _(A)_ For United 
States expenditures under subsections (~a), (~b), (~d), (~e), 
(~f), (~h) through (~r) of Section 104 of the Act or under 
any of such subsections, the rupee equivalent of $200 million. _(B)_ 
For grant to the Government of India under subsection (~e) 
of Section 104 of the Act, the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 
million for financing such projects to promote balanced economic development 
as may from time to time be mutually agreed. _(C)_ For loan 
to the Government of India under subsection (~g) of Section 104 
of the Act, the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for 
financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may 
be mutually agreed. The terms and conditions of the loan and other 
provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two Governments.

In the event that agreement is not reached on the use 
of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date 
of this Agreement, the Government of the United States of America 
may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by Section 
104 of the Act. _2._ In the event the total of rupees accruing 
to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence 
of sales made pursuant to this Agreement is different from the rupee 
equivalent of $1,276 million, the amounts available for the purposes 
specified in paragraph 1, Article /2, will be adjusted proportionately. 

#ARTICLE /3, DEPOSIT OF RUPEES#

The deposit of rupees to 
the account of the Government of the United States of America in payment 
for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed 
by the Government of the United States of America (except excess 
costs resulting from the requirement that United States flag vessels 
be used) shall be made at the rate of exchange for United States dollars 
generally applicable to import transactions (excluding imports granted 
a preferential rate) in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement 
by United States banks, or by the Government of the United States 
of America, as provided in the purchase authorizations. 

#ARTICLE 
/4, GENERAL UNDERTAKINGS#

_1._ The Government of India agrees 
that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or 
transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes 
(except where such resale, transshipment or use is specifically 
approved by the Government of the United States of America), of 
the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions 
of this Agreement, and to assure that the purchase of such commodities 
does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities 
for export from India. _2._ The two Governments agree that 
they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases 
of surplus agricultural commodities, pursuant to the Agreement 
will not displace usual marketings of the United States of America 
in these commodities, or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural 
commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries. 
_3._ In carrying out this Agreement, the two Governments 
will seek to assure, to the extent practicable, conditions of commerce 
permitting private traders to function effectively and will use their 
best endeavors to develop and extend continuous market demand for agricultural 
commodities. _4._ The Government of India agrees to 
furnish, upon request of the United States of America, information 
on the progress of the program, particularly with respect to the arrival 
and condition of commodities and the provisions for the maintenance 
of usual marketings, and information relating to exports of the same 
or like commodities. 

#ARTICLE /5, CONSULTATION#

The two Governments 
will, upon the request of either of them, consult regarding any 
matter relating to the application of this Agreement or to the operation 
of arrangements carried out pursuant to this Agreement.

/6, ENTRY INTO FORCE#

The agreement shall enter into force upon 
signature.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the respective representatives, 
duly authorized for the purpose, have signed the present Agreement.

DONE at Washington in duplicate this fourth day of 
May 1960.   FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

DWIGHT D& EISENHOWER   FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
OF INDIA:   S& K& PATIL 
EXCELLENCY:   I have the honor to refer to the Agricultural 
Commodities Agreement signed today between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of India (hereinafter 
referred to as the Agreement) and, with regard to the rupees accruing 
to uses indicated under Article /2, of the Agreement, to state 
that the understanding of the Government of the United States of 
America is as follows: _1._ With respect to Article /2,, Paragraph 
1 (~a) of the Agreement: _(/1,)_ The Government 
of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent 
of $4 million (up to a maximum of $1 million per year) accruing 
under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes 
into currencies other than United States dollars on request of 
the Government of the United States of America. This facility is 
needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market 
development activities of the Government of the United States in 
other countries.   The Government of the United States of America 
may utilize rupees in India to pay for goods and services, including 
international transportation needed in connection with market development 
and other agricultural projects and activities in India and 
other countries. _(/2,)_ The rupee equivalent of $63.8 million, 
but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the Agreement 
will be used for loans to be made by the Export-Import Bank 
of Washington under Section 104 (~e) of the Agricultural Trade 
Development and Assistance Act, as amended (hereinafter referred to 
as the Act), and for administrative expenses of the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington in India incident thereto. It is understood that: 
_(A)_ Such loans under Section 104 (~e) of the Act will 
be made to United States business firms and branches, subsidiaries, 
or affiliates of such firms in India for business development and trade 
expansion in India and to United States firms and to Indian firms 
for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization, 
distribution, or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets 
for United States agricultural products. In the event the rupees set 
aside for loans under Section 104 (~e) of the Act are not advanced 
within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed 
loans have not been mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank 
of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government 
of India, the Government of the United States of America 
may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the 
Act. _(B)_ Loans will be mutually agreeable to the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington and the Government of India acting through 
the Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance. The 
Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, or his designate, will 
act for the Government of India, and the President of the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington, or his designate, will act for the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington. _(C)_ Upon receipt of an application 
which the Export-Import Bank is prepared to consider, the Export-Import 
Bank will inform the Department of Economic Affairs 
of the identity of the applicant, the nature of the proposed business, 
the amount of the proposed loan, and the general purposes for which the 
loan proceeds would be expended. _(D)_ When the Export-Import 
Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application, it will so notify 
the Department of Economic Affairs and will indicate the interest 
rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed 
loan. The interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in India 
on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the 
purposes of the financing. _(E)_ Within sixty days after the receipt 
of notice that the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably 
upon an application the Department of Economic Affairs will indicate 
to the Export-Import Bank whether or not the Department of 
Economic Affairs has any objection to the proposed loan. Unless within 
the sixty-day period the Export-Import Bank has received such 
a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs it shall be 
understood that the Department of Economic Affairs has no objection 
to the proposed loan. When the Export-Import Bank approves or declines 
the proposed loan, it will notify the Department of Economic 
Affairs. _2._ With respect to Article /2,, paragraphs 1 (~b) 
and 1 (~c): 
Uses of Section 104 (~e) and Section 104(~g) rupees: The 
Government of India will use the amount of rupees granted or loaned 
to it by the United States pursuant to paragraphs 1(~b) and 1(~c) 
for projects to promote economic development with emphasis upon 
the agricultural sector including food reserve storage structures and 
facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon by the authorized 
representatives of the United States and the authorized representatives 
of the Government of India, in the following sectors: _A._ 
Agriculture. _B._ Industry, including the production of fertilizer, 
irrigation and power, transport and communications, and credit institutions. 
_C._ Public health, education, and rehabilitation. _D._ 
Other economic development projects consistent with the purposes 
of Sections 104 (~e) and 104 (~g) of the Act. The Government 
of India further agrees in cooperation with the Government of the 
United States, to coordinate the use of grant and loan funds provided 
for in paragraphs 1 
(~b) and 1 (~c) of Article /2, with such direct 
dollar assistance as may be made available by the Government of 
the United States of America, so that both sources of financing may 
be channeled to specific and clearly identifiable economic development 
programs and projects. _3._ It is agreed that any goods delivered 
or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects 
within categories ~A, ~B, and ~C under paragraph 2 above which 
may later be approved by the United States will be eligible for financing 
from currency granted or loaned to the Government of India. 
_4._ With regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under 
Article /2, of the Agreement, the understanding of the Government 
of the United States of America, with respect to both paragraphs 1 
(~b) and 1 (~c) of Article /2, is as follows: _(/1,)_ 
Local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the Government of India 
for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1 (~b) and 1 (~c) 
of Article /2, of the Agreement upon the presentation of such 
documentation as the United States may specify. _(/2,)_ The 
Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and 
records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed 
projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 (~b) and 1 (~c) of Article 
/2, of the Agreement, to disclose the use thereof in the projects 
and to record the progress of the projects (including the cost thereof). 
The books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained 
for the duration of the project, or until the expiration of three 
years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the United 
States, whichever is later. The two Governments shall have the 
right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and 
all other documents, correspondence, memoranda and other records involving 
transactions relating to agreed projects. The Government of India 
shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States 
to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and 
services financed under the projects, and shall furnish to the United 
States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning 
the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto. 
This broad delegation leaves within our discretion (subject to the always-present 
criterion of the public interest) both the determination 
of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive, and the 
methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided. _3._ 
The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast (~AM) 
band, from 540 kc& to 1600 kc&. Whenever two or more standard 
broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent 
frequencies, each interferes to some extent with reception of 
the other. The extent of such interference- which may be so slight 
as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders 
a usable signal, or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service 
areas of both stations- depends on many factors, among the principal 
ones being the distance between the stations, their respective 
radiated power, and, of particular significance here, <the time of day>. 
Other factors playing a part in the the extent of ~AM service 
and interference are the frequency involved, the time of year, the position 
of the year in the sunspot cycle, ground conductivity along 
the 
transmission path, atmospheric and manmade noise, and others. With the 
existence of these many factors, some of them variable, it obviously 
has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments 
of ~AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure 
against any interference in any circumstances. Rather, such assignments 
are made, as they must be, on the basis of certain overall rules 
and standards, representing to some extent a statistical approach to 
the problem, taking into account for each situation some of the variables 
(e&g&, power and station separations) and averaging out others 
in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection 
against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of 
stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation. 
An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established 
for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference 
which is regarded as objectionable. By this standard, it is determined 
that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved, 
objectionable interference from station ~A exists at any point within 
the service area of station ~B where station ~A's signal 
is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station ~B's 
signal at that point. _4._ The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel 
interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which 
we must always take into account in ~AM assignments and allocations- 
that signals from a particular station are potential sources 
of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within 
which they provide useful service. A second fundamental principle 
is that involved particularly in the present proceeding- the difference 
between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect 
to the standard broadcast frequencies. This is a phenomenon familiar 
to all radio listeners, resulting from reflection of skywave signals at 
night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere. 
All ~AM stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals, 
at all hours; but during the middle daytime hours these skywave 
radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity, and during 
this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference 
are, in general, negligible. But during nighttime hours the skywave 
radiations are reflected from the ionosphere, thereby creating the possibility 
of one station's rendering service, via skywave, at a much 
greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal, and at the 
same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the 
still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference 
to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent 
frequencies. Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime 
propagation conditions, it has been necessary to evolve different allocation 
structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the ~AM 
band, with many more stations operating during the day than at night. 
_5._ It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime 
to nighttime propagation conditions, and vice versa, is not an instantaneous 
process, but takes place over periods of time from roughly 
2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset, and again from 
roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise. During 
the period of about 4 hours around sunset, skywave transmission conditions 
are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail; during 
the same period around sunrise, skywave transmission is declining, 
until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes 
of little practical significance. However, in this case as elsewhere 
it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to 
all situations, representing an averaging of conditions, and thus to 
fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points 
between daytime and nighttime conditions. It was determined that 
the hours of sunrise and sunset, respectively, should be used for this 
purpose. Accordingly, the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations 
upon the operation of daytime stations. Class /2, stations 
operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate 
under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset (for daytime 
class /2, stations) or sunset at the location of the dominant 
class /1, station where located west of the class /2, station (for 
limited-time class /2, stations).   The same restrictions apply 
after local sunset in the case of class /3, stations operating on 
regional channels, which after that time are required to operate under 
nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other. With respect 
to nighttime assignments, the degree of skywave service and interference 
is determined by skywave curves (figs& 1 and 2 of sec& 3.190 
of the rules) giving average skywave values. These curves were derived 
by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data. It was recognized 
that skywave signals, because of their reflected nature, are of great 
variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength. For this 
reason, the more uncertain skywave service was denominated "secondary" 
in our rules, as compared to the steadier, more reliable groundwave 
"primary service", and, for both skywave service and skywave 
interference, signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of 
time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded- 50 percent of 
the time for skywave service, 10 percent of the time for skywave interference. 

#ALLOCATION POLICIES#

_6._ As mentioned, the allocation 
of ~AM stations represents a balance between protection against 
interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number 
of stations. The rules and policies to be applied in this process of 
course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired 
if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation. Our objectives, 
as we have stated many times, are- _(1)_ To provide some 
service to all listeners; _(2)_ To provide as many choices of 
service to as many listeners as possible; _(3)_ To provide service 
of local origin to as many listeners as possible. Since broadcast 
frequencies are very limited in number, these objectives are to some 
extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized, and 
to the extent that each is realized, there is a corresponding reduction 
of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others. Accordingly, 
the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern 
for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern 
for other frequencies, and has assigned different frequencies for use 
by different classes of stations. Some 45 frequencies are assigned for 
use primarily by dominant <Class /1,- ~A> or <Class /1,- 
~B clear-channel> stations, designed to operate with adequate 
power and to provide service- both groundwave and (at night) skywave- 
over large areas and at great distances, being protected against 
interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective. In dealing 
with these frequencies, the objective listed first above- provision 
of service to all listeners- was predominant; the other objectives 
were subordinated to it. The class /1, stations on these clear 
channels are protected to their 0.1-mv&/m& groundwave contours 
against daytime cochannel interference. With respect to skywave service 
rendered at night, class /1,- ~A stations are the only stations 
permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified 
for class /1,- ~A operation, and so render skywave service 
free 
from cochannel interference whereever they may be received; class 
/1,- ~B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv&/m& 
50-percent 
time skywave contours against cochannel interference. Since 
the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference, 
only class /1, stations are capable of rendering skywave service. 
But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course 
entails skywave interference to groundwave service, interference which 
is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it. _7._ With 
respect to other frequencies, these are designated as regional or local, 
and assigned for use by class /3, and class /4, stations, respectively, 
stations operating generally with lower power. In the allocation 
pattern worked out for these frequencies, the provision of long-range 
service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives- 
assignment of multiple facilities, and assignment of stations 
in as many communities as possible. _8._ As mentioned, the primary 
allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations 
on clear channels is the provision of widespread service, free from 
destructive interference. During nighttime hours, because of the intense 
skywave propagation then prevailing, no large number of stations can 
be permitted to operate on one of these channels, if the wide area 
service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily 
by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render 
it. Therefore, under our longstanding allocation rules, on some of 
these channels no station other than the dominant (class /1,- ~A) 
station is permitted to operate at night, so that the /1,- ~A 
station can render service, interference free, wherever it can be received. 
On the remainder of the clear channels, the dominant (class 
/1,- ~B) stations are protected as described above, and the relatively 
small number of secondary (class /2,) stations permitted to operate 
on these channels at night are required to operate directionally 
and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class /1, stations. 
In the daytime, on the other hand, since skywave transmission is relatively 
inefficient, it is possible to assign a substantially larger number 
of stations on these channels. Additional class /2, assignments 
for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference 
to the class /1, stations or to each other, and by their operation 
provide additional service on these channels and additional local 
outlets for a large number of communities. Such additional daytime 
class /2, assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made 
of these frequencies, and the Commission has over the years made a large 
number of them. Similarly, on the regional channels many class /3, 
stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate 
nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power. _9._ 
Essentially, the question presented for decision in the present Daytime 
Skywave proceeding is whether our decision [in 1938-1939] to 
assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset, 
is sound as a basis for ~AM allocations, or whether, in the light 
of later developments and new understanding, skywave transmission 
is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and 
after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account, and 
some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these 
hours. 

#THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDING#

_10._ The decision 
reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount 
of data and thorough study thereof. Since then, there has been a notable 
increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional 
data and the development of new techniques for using it, leading 
to a better understanding of propagation phenomena. In 1947, affidavits 
were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations 
alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service 
areas of these stations during daylight hours, from class /2, stations 
whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to 
create skywave intereference. 
If you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table, and 
later find you should have itemized your deductions, you may do so by 
filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim 
for refund. See <You May Claim a Refund>, Page 135. The same 
is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should 
have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table. The words {amended 
return} should be plainly written across the top of such return. 
_WHEN AND WHERE TO FILE_ April 15 is usually the final date 
for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar 
year ending on December 31. If you use a fiscal year, a year ending 
on the last day of any month other than December, your return is 
due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your 
tax year. _SATURDAY, SUNDAY, OR HOLIDAY._ If the last day (due 
date) for performing {any} act for tax purposes, such as filing a 
return or making a tax payment, etc&, falls on Saturday, Sunday, 
or a legal holiday, you may perform that act on the next succeeding day 
which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Since April 15, 
1962, is on Sunday your return for the calendar year 1961 will be 
timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday, April 16, 1962.

{IF YOU MAIL A RETURN} or tax payment, you must place it 
in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before 
the due date. _DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX._ If you were required 
to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961, 
it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 
15, 1962, if you file your income tax return Form 1040, and pay 
your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31, 1962. The 
filing of an original or amended declaration, otherwise due on January 
15, 1962, is also waived, if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and 
pay the full tax by January 31, 1962. Farmers, for these purposes, 
have until February 15, 1962, to file Form 1040 and pay the tax in 
full for the calendar year 1961. Fiscal year taxpayers have until the 
last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal year (farmers 
until the 15th day of the 2d month). See Chapter 38.   {Nonresident 
aliens living in Canada or Mexico} who earn wages in 
the United States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages, 
the same as if they were citizens of the United States. Their 
United States tax returns are due April 16, 1962. However, if their 
United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages, 
their returns are due June 15, 1962, if they use a calendar year, 
or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of their fiscal year. 
_NONRESIDENT ALIENS IN PUERTO RICO._ If you are a nonresident 
alien and a resident of Puerto Rico, your return is also due June 
15, 1962, or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of your fiscal 
year.   {IF A TAXPAYER DIES,} the executor, administrator, 
or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent 
on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of 
the deceased taxpayer's normal tax year. Suppose John Jones, who, 
for 1960, filed on the basis of a calendar year, died June 20, 1961. 
His return for the period January 1 to June 20, 1961, is due April 
16, 1962.   The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim 
for refund of an overpayment of tax. In such a case, Form 1310 should 
be completed and attached to the return. This form may be obtained 
from the local office of your district director.   {RETURNS 
OF ESTATES OR TRUSTS} are due on or before the 15th day of the 
4th month after the close of the tax year. _EXTENSIONS OF TIME FOR 
FILING._ Under unusual circumstances a resident individual may be 
granted an extension of time to file a return. You may apply for such 
an extension by filing Form 2688, <Application For Extension Of 
Time To File>, with the District Director of Internal Revenue 
for your district, or you may make your application in a letter. Your 
application must include the following information: (1) your reasons 
for requesting an extension, (2) whether you filed timely income tax 
returns for the 3 preceding years, and (3) whether you were required 
to file an estimated return for the year, and if so whether you did file 
and have paid the estimated tax payments on or before the due dates. 
Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments 
when due must be fully explained. Extensions are not granted as a matter 
of course, and the reasons for your request must be substantial. If 
you are unable to sign the request, because of illness or other good 
cause, another person who stands in close personal or business relationship 
to you may sign the request on your behalf, stating the reason 
why you are unable to sign. You should make any request for an extension 
early so that if it is refused, your return may still be on time. 
See also <Interest on Unpaid Taxes>, below. _EXTENSIONS WHILE 
ABROAD._ Citizens of the United States who, on April 15, are not 
in the United States or Puerto Rico, are allowed an extension of 
time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar 
year. An extension of 2 months beyond the regular due date for filing 
is also available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal year. _ALASKA 
AND HAWAII._ Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also 
allowed this extension of time for filing, but those residing or traveling 
in Hawaii are {not} allowed this automatic extension.

{Military or Naval Personnel} on duty in Alaska or outside 
the United States and Puerto Rico are also allowed this automatic 
extension of time for filing their returns.   {You must attach 
a statement} to your return, if you take advantage of this automatic 
extension, showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United 
States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date. _INTEREST 
ON UNPAID TAXES._ Interest at the rate of 6% a year must be paid 
on taxes that are not paid on or before their due date. Such interest 
must be paid even though an {extension of time for filing} is granted. 
_WHEN PAYMENT IS DUE._ If your computation on Form 1040 or 
Form 1040~A shows you owe additional tax, it should be remitted 
with your return unless you owe less than $1, in which case it is forgiven. 
If payment is by cash, you should ask for a receipt. If you file 
Form 1040~A and the District Director computes your tax, you 
will be sent a bill if additional tax is due. This bill should be paid 
within 30 days. _PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER._ Whether the 
check is certified or uncertified, the tax is not paid until the check 
is paid. If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date 
deadline elapses, additions to the tax may be incurred. Furthermore, 
a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties. All checks 
and money orders should be made payable to <Internal Revenue Service>. 
_REFUNDS._ An overpayment of income and social security taxes 
entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the 
overpayment should be applied to your succeeding year's estimated 
tax.   {If you file Form 1040~A} and the District Director 
computes your tax, any refund to which you are entitled will be 
mailed to you.   {If you file a Form 1040,} you should indicate 
in the place provided that there is an overpayment of tax and the 
amount you want refunded and the amount you want credited against your 
estimated tax.   {Refunds of less than $1} will not be made 
unless you attach a separate application to your return requesting such 
a refund. _WHERE TO FILE._ Send your return to the Director 
of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence 
or principal place of business. If you have neither a legal residence 
nor a principal place of business in any internal revenue district, 
your return should be filed with the District Director of Internal 
Revenue, Baltimore 2, Md&. If your principal place of abode 
for the tax year is outside the United States (including Alaska 
and Hawaii), Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal 
residence or principal place of business in any internal revenue 
district in the United States, you should file your return with the 
Office of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington 
25, D&C&. _ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME_ The deductions 
allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on 
a comparable basis. It is the amount you enter on line 9, page 1 of Form 
1040. Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine 
Adjusted Gross Income. Other deductions are subtracted only 
from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income. 
{TO COMPUTE YOUR ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME} you total all items 
of income. (See Chapter 6.) From this amount deduct the items indicated 
below.   {Businessmen} deduct all ordinary and necessary 
expenses attributable to a trade or business. _RENTS OR ROYALTIES._ 
If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you 
subtract, in computing Adjusted Gross Income, ordinary and necessary 
expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property. 
(See Chapter 15.)   {Outside salesmen} deduct all expenses 
attributable to earning a salary, commission, or other compensation. 
(See Chapter 10.)   {Employees} deduct expenses of travel, 
meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance 
of their services as employees. They also deduct transportation 
expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees 
even though they are not away from home. (See Chapter 12.) 
If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred, you deduct such 
expenses if they otherwise qualify. (See Chapter 10.)   {Sick 
pay,} if included in your Gross Income, is deducted in arriving 
at Adjusted Gross Income. If your sick pay is not included in your 
Gross Income, you may not deduct it. (See Chapter 9.) _INCOME 
FROM ESTATES AND TRUSTS._ If you are a life tenant, you deduct allowable 
depreciation and depletion. If you are an income beneficiary of 
property held in trust or an heir, legatee, or devisee, you may deduct 
allowable depreciation and depletion, if not deductible by the estate 
or trust.   {Deductible losses on sales or exchanges} of 
property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income. (See 
Chapter 20.) _50% OF CAPITAL GAINS._ You also deduct 50% 
of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital 
losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income. (See Chapter 24.) 
_OTHER DEDUCTIONS._ Certain other deductions are not allowed in 
determining Adjusted Gross Income. They may be claimed only by itemizing 
them on page 2 of Form 1040. These deductions may not be claimed 
if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or tax Table. (See 
Chapters 30 through 37.) 

#2. MINORS MINORS MUST ALSO FILE RETURNS 
IF THEY EARN $600 OR MORE DURING THE YEAR.#

A MINOR IS subject 
to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may, under local 
law, have the right to them and might actually have received the money. 
His income is not required to be included in the return of his parent.

{A MINOR CHILD IS ALLOWED A PERSONAL EXEMPTION} 
of $600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn. _EXEMPTION 
ALSO ALLOWED PARENT._ If your child is under 19 or is a 
student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as your 
dependent, even though he earns $600 or more. See Chapter 5. _EXAMPLE._ 
Your 16 year old son earned $720 in 1961. You spent $800 for 
his support. Since he had gross income of $600 or more, he must file 
a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $600. Since 
you contributed more than half of his support, you may also claim an 
exemption for him on your return. _HE MAY GET A TAX REFUND._ A 
minor who has gross income of less than $600 is entitled to a refund if 
income tax was withheld from his wages. Generally, the refund may be 
obtained by filing Form 1040~A accompanied by the withholding statement 
(Form ~W-2). If he had income other than wages subject to 
withholding, he may be required to file Form 1040. See Chapter 1.

{IF YOUR CHILD WORKS FOR YOU,} you may deduct reasonable 
wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your business. 
You may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to 
purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally 
obligated to furnish him, and even though you may be entitled to his 
services. 
The one- or two-season hunt, of which there have been too many recently, 
may do more harm than good; for such programs raise hopes of assistance 
toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which 
are dashed when the programs are discontinued; and they are dashed, 
no less, by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development 
toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit.   For 
the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any 
foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments 
of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good: such judgments 
can be known to be good only by the records of those selected, 
by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods 
of time.   The central group of the Foundation's advisors 
are, at any one period of time, the members of our Advisory Board, 
consisting, now, of thirty-six men and women. They are chosen by the 
Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate 
accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts. 
Their locations in all parts of the United States, and their locations 
in the several kinds of educational and research institutions 
that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths 
also are factors in the Trustees' minds. For this concept of an 
Advisory Board, ancillary to the Board of Trustees, we are indebted 
to the late President of Harvard University, A& Lawrence Lowell, 
a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions 
and their administration. That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr& 
Lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection 
is one reason why our selections have been, it may be said truly, 
pretty uniformly good.   For in accordance with Mr& Lowell's 
concept of an advisory board, our selections are made by experienced 
selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes 
and our choices. And lest we should become too consistent, in the 
sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points 
of view in the arts, the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains 
a trickle- not a flow!- of new members through the Advisory Board.

Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute 
the committees of selection- one for the selection of Fellows 
from Canada, the United States, and the English-speaking Caribbean 
area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American 
republics and the Republic of the Philippines.   To the members 
of our Advisory Board, and most specially to its members who constitute 
our committees of selection, the Foundation is indebted for its 
successes of choice of Fellows. We are, as we know, utterly dependent 
on the quality of advice we get; and quality of advice, added to 
devotion to the Foundation's purposes and ideals, we do get from 
our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated 
only by those of us who work here every day.   But the facts about 
our Advisory Board and its members' duties are only one of several 
sets of facts about the quest for advice, both reliable and imaginative, 
on which to base our selections of Fellows. For example, the 
interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains 
such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal 
much as they had done when they were, formally, members of that Board. 
And, besides, there are a large number of scholars, artists, composers 
of music, novelists, poets, essayists, choreographers, lawyers, servants 
of government, and men of affairs- hundreds, indeed- who serve 
the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis 
out of their experience.   To all, the Foundation gives the kind 
of thanks which are more than thanks: to them we are grateful beyond 
the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are. #@# 

IT IS a truism of business that no business can be better than 
its board of directors and its top management. The same is true of 
every foundation. During the biennium reviewed in this Report, our 
Board of Trustees named able men, younger than the rest of us, to the 
Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class 
administration of the Foundation's affairs:   Dr& 
James Brown Fisk, physicist, President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, 
was elected to the Board of Trustees. He is a member 
both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical 
Society; and he has served our country well as a scientific 
statesman on international commissions.   Dr& Gordon N& 
Ray, Provost, Vice-President and Professor of English in the University 
of Illinois, was appointed Associate Secretary General. 
The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr& Ray to that position 
with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary 
General upon the latter's eventual retirement. Dr& Ray is 
a Fellow of the Foundation- appointed thrice to assist his studies 
of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H& G& Wells- and, 
before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff, had been 
given our highest scholarly accolade, appointment to the Advisory Board.

Referring further to the Foundation's officers, Dr& 
James F& Mathias, for eleven years our discerning colleague as 
Associate Secretary, was promoted to be Secretary. He is a historian, 
with the great merit of a historian's long view.   Also appointed 
to the Foundation's staff, as Assistant Secretary, is Mr& 
J& Kellum Smith, Jr&. Mr& Smith, like the present Secretary 
General, is a lawyer; and lawyers- with the great virtues 
that they are trained to read "the fine print" carefully and are 
able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions 
to difficult problems in many fields- are indispensable even in a foundation 
office.   The present Secretary General has been the 
Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the 
Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago. But even he will 
not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are, quite 
simply, made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation's 
policies and practices. The effective recognition of excellence and 
its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day, nor even 
in a year. #@#

WE ARE not given to lamentations, neither personally 
nor in these Reports. On the contrary, if this be an apocalyptic 
era as is commonly said, we see it as an era of opportunity. For, 
granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved, these 
problems make great demands; and by their demanding tend to create 
resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers 
do not bring forth. Of this, examples are legion: Pericles speaking 
his funeral oration in Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae 
and making it a testament of freedom; Jefferson writing the 
Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution; 
Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount, close to his ultimate sacrifice; 
Shakespeare speaking with "the indescribable gusto of the 
Elizabethan voice"- Keats's words- in the days of the Spanish 
Armada's threats; Isaac Newton, at the age of twenty-three, 
industriously calculating logarithms "to two and fifty places" during 
the great plague year in England, 1665; Winston Churchill's 
Olympian, optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone 
against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago; the 
present-day explorations of outer space, answering age-old questions 
of science and philosophy, in the face of possible wars of extinction.

<Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit>, as the Roman poet, 
Virgil, declared with much more historical sense than most writers 
of today. It gives, indeed, cause for rejoicing to remember what many 
catastrophes of the past produced; and it is to be noted also that 
confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared 
in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind.

For example, out of the social evils of the English industrial 
revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens; and his genius 
moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men- 
until today-, in the industrialized West, these social evils 
substantially do not exist. The solutions were not arrived at by any 
theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government- lawyers, 
most of them- and men of business. These were educated men, 
who, as Mr& Justice Holmes was fond of saying, formed their inductions 
out of experience under the burden of responsibility. That is, 
to put it realistically, they had to run their businesses at a profit, 
or they had to get the votes to get elected. Nevertheless, they made 
naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the "workers"- 
to use Marx's word- more than a subsistence wage, with 
the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its 
way into the capitalists' pockets with the result, in turn, that the 
gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery 
of the poor increase.   But as all understand who have eyes 
to see, nothing of the kind has happened; indeed, the contrary has 
happened. The gulf between the "rich" and the "poor" has narrowed, 
in the industrialized Western world, to the point that the word 
"poor" is hardly applicable. And the reason this could happen is 
clear: men of government, business men, lawyers and all who concerned 
themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their 
concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of 
freedom and opportunity. Some would say that they were not permitted 
to run their businesses only for profit; and even putting it that 
way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong.   Sir Henry 
Sumner Maine, a hundred years before Communism was a force to be 
reckoned with, wrote his brilliant legal generalization, that "the 
progress of society is from status to contract". The essence of contract 
is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not 
do. Hence, the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice. 
The greater the range of freedom for individual men, the greater 
the range of choice; the greater the range of choice, the greater 
the rate of change. For change is dependent on the possibilities that 
individual men glimpse for the future. But when there is not freedom 
and opportunity to choose, men- individual men- must remain in status 
and society does not, cannot progress.   The eternal truth 
is that progress- due, as it always is, to individual creative genius- 
is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the 
beating of the heart.   And lest anybody think that considerations 
such as these are not germane in a foundation report, let me enlighten 
them with the truths that, under Communism there would have been 
no capital with which to endow the Foundation, and that there would 
not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed, 
untrammeled in every way, toward their discoveries, their creative 
efforts for the good of mankind. #@#

DURING the year 1959, 
we granted 354 Fellowships; in 1960, we granted 334. As heretofore, 
our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of 
knowledge and creative effort in all the arts. We do not favor one field 
over another: we think that all inquiry, all scholarly and artistic 
creation, is good- provided only that it contributes to a sense 
and understanding of the true ends of life, as all first-rate scholarship 
and artistic creation does. Indeed, if pressed, we would say what 
the late Robert Henri, American painter, said to a pupil, "Anything 
will do for a subject: it's what <you> do with it that counts".

Thus, we have no part, and want none, in current discussions 
of the relative importance of science, the social studies, the humanities, 
the creative arts. We want no part in such discussions, because 
we think them largely futile; and we think them largely futile because, 
for true excellence of accomplishment, every scholar and every 
artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of 
view.

When the Brown + Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 
125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958, it became an almost 
unique institution in the mechanical world.   With its history 
standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution, 
Brown + Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument 
to the mechanical foresight of its founder, Joseph R& Brown, and 
a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology.

Joseph R& Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise 
of New England between 1810 and 1830. He was early exposed to 
the mechanical world, and in his youth often helped his father, David 
Brown, master clock and watchmaker, as he plied his trade. At the 
age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott + 
Harris in Valley Falls, Rhode Island, and following two or three 
other jobs in quick succession after graduation, he went into business 
for himself in 1831, making lathes and small tools. This enterprise 
led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833, under the name 
D& Brown + Son, a business which eventually grew into the modern 
corporation we now call Brown + Sharpe.   The years of Joseph's 
partnership with his father were numbered. In 1838, a devastating 
fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved 
west to Illinois, settling on a land grant in his declining years.

Joseph Brown continued in business by himself, quickly rebuilding 
the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those 
first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the 
standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world.

Much of his genius, of course, sprang from his familiarity with 
clock movements. During these early years the repair of watches and 
clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed 
an important part of the young man's occupation. He became particularly 
interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's, 
and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during 
this period. But his business also grew, and we are told that Mr& 
Brown found it 
increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his 
creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire. It must have 
been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12, 1848, Joseph 
Brown made the momentous entry in his job book, in his characteristically 
cryptic style, "Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day 
as an apprentice".   The young apprentice apparently did well 
by Mr& Brown, for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian 
was offered a full partnership in the firm; the company became "J& 
R& Brown + Sharpe", and entered into a new and important 
period of its development. Mr& Sharpe's arrival in the business 
did indeed provide what Mr& Brown had most coveted- time for "tinkering", 
and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those 
developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that 
time.   By 1853, the new partnership announced the precision 
vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts. The basic 
significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 
by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing 
engine. That development, in turn, formed the foundation of still more 
significant expansions in later years- in gear cutting, in circular 
graduating, in index drilling, and in many other fields where accuracy 
was a paramount requirement.   Throughout their careers, both 
Mr& Brown and Mr& Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting 
up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades. Several 
efforts were made in this direction, and though not all of them survive 
to this day, the Brown + Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted 
as the American standard and is still in common use today.

As one development followed another, the company's reputation for 
precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities 
for expansion in precision manufacture. In 1858, the partnership 
began manufacturing the Willcox + Gibbs sewing machine.

As the story goes, Mr& Gibbs, who originally came from the back 
counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia, saw an illustration in a 
magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine. Curious as to what made 
it work, he built a crude model of it in wood, and filed a piece of steel 
until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread, enabling 
the crude machine to take stitches. When he showed this model as his 
"solution" as to how the Howe sewing machine operated, he was 
told he was "wrong", and discovered to his amazement that the Howe 
Machine, which was unknown to him in detail, used two threads while 
the one that he had perfected used only one. Thus was invented the 
single thread sewing machine, which Mr& Gibbs in partnership with 
Mr& Willcox decided to bring to Brown + Sharpe with the proposal 
that the small company undertake its manufacture.   The new work 
was a boon to the partnership, not only for its own value but particularly 
for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J& R& 
Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment.

The turret screw machine, now known as the Brown + Sharpe hand 
screw machine, takes its ancestry directly from Mr& Brown's efforts 
to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing 
machine. Mr& Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine 
design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret, 
by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock, and reversible 
tap and die holders.   In 1861, Mr& Brown's attention 
was called to yet another basic production problem- the manufacture 
of twist drills. At that time, during the Civil War, Union muskets 
were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them 
were being hand-filed with rattail files. This process neither satisfied 
the urgent production schedules nor Mr& Brown's imagination 
of the possibilities in the situation. The child of this problem was 
Mr& Brown's famous Serial No& 1 Universal Milling Machine, 
the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type 
milling machine used throughout the world. The original machine, bearing 
its famous serial number, is still on exhibition at the Brown + Sharpe 
Precision Center in Providence.   During the Civil War 
period Mr& Brown also invented the Brown + Sharpe formed tooth 
gear cutter, a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's 
gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics. 
Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear 
teeth, but they were good for only one sharpening. As soon as the 
time came for re-sharpening, the precise form of the gear tooth was lost 
and a new cutter had to be made. This process made the economical 
manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit 
the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss 
of the precision form. Mr& Brown's invention achieved this and, 
as a byproduct, formed the cornerstone of Brown + Sharpe's position 
of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until 
the 1920's when superceded by other methods.   The micrometer 
caliper, as a common workshop tool, also owes much to J& R& Brown. 
Although Mr& Brown was not himself its inventor (it was a French 
idea), it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance 
of mass producing this basic tool for general use. So it was 
that when Mr& Brown and Mr& Sharpe first saw the French tool 
on exhibition in Paris in 1868, they brought a sample with them to the 
United States and started Brown + Sharpe in yet another field where 
it retains its leadership to this day.   The final achievement 
of Mr& Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a 
close second in importance to his development of the universal milling 
machine. That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding 
machine, which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial 
Exposition. This machine, like its milling counterpart, was 
the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision 
metalworking shops throughout the world. Along with J& R& Brown's 
other major developments, the universal grinding machine was profoundly 
influential in setting the course of Brown + Sharpe for many 
years to come.   Following Mr& Brown's death, there came 
forward in the Brown + Sharpe organization many other men who contributed 
greatly to the development of the company. One such man was Samuel 
Darling.   As head of the firm Darling + Swartz, Mr& 
Darling began by challenging Brown + Sharpe to its keenest competition 
during the 1850's and early 60's. In 1868, however, a truce 
was called between the companies, and the partnership of Darling, brown 
+ Sharpe was formed. Between that year and the buying out of Mr& 
Darling's interest in 1892, a large portion of the company's precision 
tool business was carried out under the name of Darling, Brown 
+ Sharpe, and to this day many old precision tools are in use still 
bearing that famous trademark.   Perhaps the outstanding standard 
bearer of Mr& Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr& Oscar 
J& Beale, whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of 
Mr& Brown, and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly 
accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown + Sharpe 
to manufacture gages, and therefore its products, with an accuracy exceeding 
anything then available elsewhere in the world.   Also important 
on the Brown + Sharpe scene, at the turn of the century, was 
Mr& Richmond Viall, Works Superintendent of the company from 
1876 to 1910. Mr& Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership 
and development of men. He was an ardent champion of the Brown 
+ Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able 
men who first developed their industrial talents with the company. 
In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown + Sharpe 
products over the years has been the men who began work with the 
company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout 
the nation and even abroad.   Commencing with the death of 
Lucian Sharpe in 1899, the name of Henry D& Sharpe was for more 
than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company. During 
his presidency, the company's physical plant was enormously expanded, 
and the length and breadth of the Brown + Sharpe machine tool 
line became the greatest in the world. During the early part of this 
century, the Brown + Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged 
as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to 
precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world. 
During these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets 
laid down by Mr& Brown. It expanded from hand screw machines 
to automatic screw machines, from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines 
to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing 
business, from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to 
a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type 
milling machines. In the grinding machine field, expansion went far 
from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders, surface 
grinders, and a wide variety of special and semi-special models.

In 1951, Henry D& Sharpe, Jr& succeeded his father and 
continued 
the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working 
equipment business. The company is still broadening its line and 
is now active on four major fronts.   The Machine Tool Division 
is currently producing Brown + Sharpe single spindle automatic screw 
machines, grinding machines of many types, and knee and bed-type 
milling machines. Recently added is the Brown + Sharpe turret drilling 
machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool 
development.   In the Industrial Products Division, the company 
manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection 
equipment, machinists' tools- including micrometers, Vernier 
calipers, and accessories.   In the Cutting Tool Division, 
the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling 
cutters, end mills and saws. 
Sales and net income for the year ended December 31, 1960 showed an 
improvement over 1959. Net income was $2,557,111, or $3.11 per share 
on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding, as compared to $2,323,867 
or $2.82 per share in 1959, adjusted to the same number of shares.

Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 
in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960. This increase was sufficient to 
overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and 
increased expenditures on research and development.   In spite 
of the fact that our largest market, the textile industry, was affected 
substantially by the current decline in business activity, we have 
been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 
at a rate materially higher than during 1959. 

#OUTLOOK FOR CURRENT 
YEAR#

Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and 
unless this trend can be reversed, our production for 1961 will be lower 
than for 1960.   However, the healthy inventory position of 
the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that 
improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961. 

#NEED FOR SOUND TAX POLICY#

In connection with our continuing 
development of new and more efficient mill machinery, a sounder U& 
S& income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment, enabling 
the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic 
basis, could, if adopted, have favorable effects on Leesona's 
business in the next few years.   Such a depreciation policy would 
also, we believe, prove a very important factor in strengthening the 
competitive position of the U& S& textile and other industries, 
thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange. 

#RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT#

Our research and development program, 
serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost 
production throughout the world, continues to have primary emphasis 
at Leesona.   This program is based on the policy of designing 
and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile 
values- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality, fashion and utility 
provide the consumer with better textile products for the money.

Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing 
mill equipment, in terms of efficiency and versatility. But more important, 
we believe, it must concentrate on the development of entirely 
new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and 
our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine. 

#BUDGET INCREASED# 

On this basis, our already substantial budget for research and 
development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance 
the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's 
future growth in sales and earnings.   Much of this necessary 
increase in research and development, though properly chargeable to 
current expenses, is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed 
and the new machines sold in quantity, usually over a period of 
several years. 

#STRETCH YARN MACHINES#

In December we began to 
ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines. These machines produce 
the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured 
fabrics. During the past year, great progress has been made by 
the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics. Fashion 
centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and 
improved "wash and wear" dresses and blouses made from these fabrics.

This machine, operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions 
per minute, is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations 
in industry today. It transfers yarn directly from the producers' 
largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom 
winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics. 

#LARGE-PACKAGE TWISTER# 

Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing 
well in our customers' mills. Later in the year, additional types 
of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other 
man-made fibers and natural yarns. These machines are designed to provide 
higher operating speeds, larger yarn packages, and greater flexibility 
of application to different types of yarn. This we believe will 
substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment. 

#UNICONER# 

Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled 
completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic 
coning machine. This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to 
make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year. This machine 
was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and 
was well received by the industry. The potential market for the machine 
should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder.   The 
Uniconer has several outstanding features- it operates with much 
greater efficiency than existing equipment; it incorporates an automatic 
knot-tying device on each spindle, and it will knot a break in 
the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end 
is exhausted.   Because the bobin-to-cone winding process is a 
relatively high-cost operation for the mill, the almost complete automation 
provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile 
production, at the same time upgrading quality. Many mills have already 
placed firm orders for this machine. 

#NEW UNIFIL APPLICATION# 

A new application for the Unifil loom winder, running single filling 
for box looms, will broaden mill use of this equipment. 

#TAKE-UP 
MACHINES#

A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate 
the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic 
yarns. It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to 
hold precise tension and speed.   This new machine takes up filament 
yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds 
up to 6,000 feet per minute. It is equipped with an automatic threading 
device to reduce waste and handling time.   Our take-up machines 
and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing 
for application with new high polymer yarns, in several fiber producing 
plants. We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding 
field. 

#DIVERSIFICATION PLANS#

We are interested in further diversification 
into other fields of capital goods, or components for industrial 
products, and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction. 

#PATTERSON MOOS RESEARCH#

Our Patterson Moos Research 
Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of 
fuel cells. The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee, Pratt 
+ Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation, 
has been important in this work. In addition to its major effort on fuel 
cells, Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry 
on research in other fields, both under contract for the Defense Department, 
other government agencies and for our own account. ~PMR 
is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman 
programs.   We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie 
Generale de Telegraphie Sans Fil (~CSF) of France for 
the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials. 
The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing 
of such materials in the United States. Initially we will import the 
thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will 
manufacture in this country. There is a rapidly growing demand for this 
material, primarily from the military. Further research, we believe, 
will develop important commercial applications.   A project for 
the Air Force has been completed in which the ~NAIR infrared 
detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous 
gases.   We are initiating research on the use of solid state 
materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require 
cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity.   The rapid 
advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation. 
Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances, and select for development 
those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities. 

#NEW PLANT FACILITIES#

Early in August we broke ground 
for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick, Rhode Island, which will house 
our textile and coil winding machinery operations. Construction is 
well along, and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of 
this year. All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will 
be transferred to Warwick. Operations in the new plant should be 
producing efficiently early in 1962.   An architect's sketch 
of the new plant is shown on the front cover. The building will contain 
430,000 square feet, approximately the same as our present plant. However, 
its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production 
capacity, permit more efficient manufacturing, and substantially 
reduce current repair and maintenance costs.   A major consideration 
in the choice of the Warwick site, four miles from Cranston, was 
the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly 
skilled work force.   We have entered into an agreement for the 
sale of the present Cranston properties, effective as soon as we have 
completed removal to our new plant. 

#BRITISH SUBSIDIARY#

During 
the year our British subsidiary, Leesona-Holt, Limited, expanded 
its plant in Darwen, England, and added machine tool capacity. The 
operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations 
in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant 
in the adjoining town of Heywood. Layout and equipment were modernized 
and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis. 
The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size 
of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations. In addition, land 
has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future. 

#FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS#

The new Warwick plant is being built 
at our expense and under our direction. It will be transfered on 
completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island, a non-profit 
organization, which will reimburse us for the cost of construction. 
we will then occupy the new plant under lease, with an option to purchase. 
These arrangements are, in our opinion, very favorable to Leesona. 
Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short 
term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank.   In addition to expenditures 
on the Warwick plant, we have invested approximately $1,961,000 
for machinery and equipment at Cranston, and for new machinery, 
plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt, Limited. We believe that these 
improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which 
will fully justify the investment.   Long term loans have been 
reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000. Inventories increased $625,561 to 
$8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months. Thus 
we enter 1961 in a strong financial position. 

#EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS# 

In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May, 1959, with 
the International Association of Machinists, ~AFL-CIO, wages 
of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May, 1960, and pay levels 
for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately. 
In addition, Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents 
was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital 
accommodations. 

#PERSONNEL BENEFITS#

In addition to direct salaries 
and wages, the Company paid or accrued during the year the following 
amounts for the benefit of employees: @   During the pension 
year ended December 31, 1960, 23 employees retired, making a total 
of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan. At 
December 13, 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of 
Providence, as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions 
to qualified members of the plan, totaled $2,412,616.

The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of 
the population that began 20 years ago. Another growth factor is increased 
consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics 
that go with a rising standard of living.   As in many other 
industries, rising costs and intense competition, both domestic and 
foreign, have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry 
in recent years. 

#INCREASED EFFICIENCY#

In textiles, as elsewhere, 
a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and 
higher productivity.   As a designer and manufacturer of textile 
production machinery, Leesona and other companies in its industry have 
sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods 
that would increase production, yet maintain both quality and flexibility. 

#PROBLEMS OF SHIFTING STYLES#

The problem of efficient 
production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves 
large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel 
or home decoration. Production must be adjusted accordingly, at 
minimum cost and quickly.   In addition, production machinery must 
in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural 
fibers and the increasing number of synthetics, as well as blends. 
Following the term of service in Japan, each emissary returns for a 
brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college 
community. The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support 
for this program. 

#MUSICAL ACTIVITIES#

THE COLLEGE was one 
of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite 
part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life. Extensive 
facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining, under 
skilled direction, the Choir, the Orchestra, the Band, the Glee 
Club, and smaller ensembles of wind and string players.   All 
students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations 
for which they qualify. Orchestra, Band, and Choir have auditions 
during the week preceding the first day of classes. The Glee Club 
is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for 
membership.   In addition to the many appearances of these organizations 
throughout the college year, there are concerts by students of 
the music department, by members of the music faculty, and by visiting 
artists.   Student musical organizations are the Knights of 
Carleton and the Overtones (men's vocal groups), and the Keynotes 
(a women's singing group). These student-directed organizations include 
eight to ten members each; they perform at many campus social 
events. 

#RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES#

FROM THE FOUNDING of the College 
those responsible for its management have planned to provide its 
students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to 
offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding 
the meaning and importance of religion. Courses are offered in 
ethics, the philosophy and history of religion, Christian thought and 
history, and the Bible. Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching 
program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute 
to the moral and religious development of its students.   A 
COLLEGE SERVICE OF WORSHIP is held each Sunday morning at eleven 
o'clock in the Chapel. The sermons are given by the College Chaplain, 
by members of the faculty, or by guest preachers. Music is furnished 
by the Carleton College Choir.   CHAPEL SERVICES 
are held weekly. These services at which attendance is voluntary are 
led by the Chaplain, by the President of the College, by selected 
faculty members, students, and visitors. The service is brief and variety 
in forms of worship is practiced.   A SUNDAY EVENING PROGRAM 
provides theological lectures, music, drama, and films related 
to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition.   ATTENDANCE 
is required at the College Service of Worship <or> at the Sunday 
Evening Program <or> at any regularly organized service of public 
worship. Each semester every student must attend ten of the services 
or religious meetings. Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary.

RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS include the groups described 
below. The Y&M&C&A& and Y&W&C&A& at Carleton 
are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry 
out their general purposes. Occasional meetings are held for the 
whole membership, usually with a guest speaker, while smaller discussion 
groups meet more frequently. The Associations sponsor many traditional 
campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new 
friendships, to broaden their interests, and to engage in worthwhile 
service projects.   There are other organizations representing 
several of the denominational groups. Included are the following: Baptist 
Student Movement, Canterbury Club (Episcopal), Christian 
Science Organization, Friends' Meeting for Worship, Hillel (Jewish), 
Liberal Religious Fellowship, Lutheran Student Association, 
Newman Club (Roman Catholic), Presbyterian Student Fellowship, 
United Student Fellowship (Congregational-Baptist), and Wesley 
Fellowship (Methodist).   Student religious organizations 
are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee, a standing 
committee of the Carleton Student Association.   THE NORTHFIELD 
CHURCHES include the following: Alliance, Congregational-Baptist, 
Episcopal, Lutheran (Norwegian, Danish, Missouri Synod, 
and Bethel), Methodist, Moravian, Pentecostal, and Roman Catholic. 

#THEATER#

THE PURPOSE of producing plays at the College 
is three-fold: to provide the Carleton students with the best possible 
opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity 
and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available; 
to encourage the practice of attending the theater; and 
to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance.

Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried 
on by The Carleton Players, which is to say by all students who 
are so inclined to advance these aims.   For the 1960-1961 season, 
The 
Carleton Players have announced <Blood Wedding> by Federico 
Garcia Lorca, <The Knight of the Burning Pestle> by Beaumont 
and Fletcher and <A Moon for the Misbegotten> by Eugene O'Neill, 
with a pre-season production of <The Glass Menagerie> by Tennessee 
Williams. 

#STUDENT WORKSHOP#

THIS workshop, located 
in Boliou Hall, provides facilities for students to work in ceramics, 
weaving, enameling, welding, woodworking, textile printing, printmaking, 
and lapidary. These extra-curricular activities are conducted 
under supervision of the Director of the Student Workshop. The 
workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week. 
A student organization, Bottega, is open to any student interested in 
increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic 
arts in their historical, technical, and productive contexts. The 
group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop. They are 
assisted and advised by members of the Art Department. 

#ATHLETICS# 

THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM at Carleton is considered an integral 
part of the activities of the College and operates under the same 
budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work.   The physical 
education program for men recognizes the value of participation 
in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and 
aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic 
competition, either intercollegiate or intramural.   The same standards 
for admission, for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid, 
and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students.

A faculty committee on athletics, responsible to the faculty 
as a whole, exercises control over the athletic program of the College. 
It concerns itself with: _1._ The policies which govern 
the program _2._ The preservation of desirable balance between 
the athletic and academic programs of the College _3._ The approval 
of athletic schedules _4._ The maintenance of Midwest Conference 
eligibility standards   Carleton is a member of the Midwest 
Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules. 
In addition to these rules, Carleton has added the following: 
_1._ A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates 
in an athletic contest during the school year, other than that 
sponsored by the College, shall be permanently ineligible to participate 
in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also 
face permanent suspension from the institution. The school year does 
not end for any student until he has completed his last examination 
of the semester. _2._ A student to be eligible for the captaincy 
of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1.00.

THE "~C" CLUB is composed of the men of the College 
who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics. The purpose 
of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to 
increase interest in them among the student body. This is done by encouraging 
the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate 
or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton 
cheerleaders. _SOCCER CLUB._ The Soccer Club was organized 
by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport. 
Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players. Practices 
are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by 
the student coach and the officers of the club. _WOMEN'S RECREATION 
ASSOCIATION._ This Association, organized in 1920, is affiliated 
with the Athletic Federation of College Women. The purpose of the 
organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational 
activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency, sportsmanship, 
and "play for play's sake". The Association is governed 
by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes. 
Membership is open to any woman student in the College. Active groups 
sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club, Orchesis, 
Golf Club, Tennis Club, and Dolphins. The Saddle Club, open to 
students proficient in horsemanship, presents the Annual Spring Riding 
Exhibition, and during the year it offers speakers, movies, breakfast 
rides, and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport. Orchesis, 
for students interested in the modern dance, contributes to the 
May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration. 
Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University 
of Minnesota each fall, and also sponsors a two-day state invitational 
tennis meet at Carleton in May. The Dolphins present a 
three-night 
water show the week of the May Fete. Under the auspices of 
the Women's Recreation Association, interclass competition is organized 
in badminton, basketball, field hockey, golf, tennis, and swimming. 
The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and 
sponsors several Play Days with St& Olaf and other near-by colleges. 
With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education 
for Men, the Women's Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments 
in tennis and golf in the fall and spring. Throughout the year 
there are social events, such as picnics, breakfast hikes, canoe trips, 
banquets, and indoor parties. 

#COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS#

IN ADDITION 
to the miscellaneous pamphlets and other printed matter which 
it issues, the College maintains regular publications, as follows:

<The Bulletin,> in five issues: <The Report of the 
President> in August; <The Alumni Fund Report> in September; 
the annual <Catalog> in March; an <Alumni Reunion Bulletin> 
in April; and a special <Bulletin> in June. The College 
also publishes each year <The Report of the Treasurer> and a monthly 
newsletter entitled <Carleton College Comments>. In co-operation 
with the Alumni Association of Carleton College, an alumni magazine, 
<The Voice of the Carleton Alumni,> is edited and mailed 
seven times a year by the College's Publications Office and the 
Alumni Office. At intervals an alumni directory is issued. 
These publications may be secured as follows: The annual <Catalog> 
from the Director of Admissions and other issues from the Publications 
Office.   In January, 1960, the first issue of <The 
Carleton Miscellany,> a quarterly literary magazine, was published 
by the College. The magazine, edited by members of the Carleton Department 
of English, includes contributions by authors from both within 
and beyond the Carleton community. 

#STUDENT PUBLICATIONS#

<The 
Carletonian,> the college newspaper, is edited by students and published 
by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board. 
(See page 100.) It is issued weekly throughout the college year. 
The Publications Board holds annual competitive examinations for 
places on the editorial and business staffs. The editor, sports editor, 
and student business manager are chosen in December, the new staff 
assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second 
semester. The paper affords excellent practice for students interested 
in the field of journalism.   <The Algol,> the college annual, 
is published in the fall of each year. <The Algol> serves as a 
record of campus organizations and student activities during the year. 
The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of 
editor and business manager and makes the appointments in the spring 
previous to the year of publication. Members of <The Algol> staff 
are nominated by the editor and business manager and appointed by the 
Publications Board.   <Manuscript,> a quarterly literary magazine, 
is published by the students of the College. It is the purpose 
of this magazine to serve as an outlet for student creative writing. 
The editor and business manager of <Manuscript> are appointed by 
the Publications Board. 

#CAMPUS BROADCASTING STATION#

A LOW-POWER, 
"carrier-current" broadcasting station, ~KARL, heard 
only in the campus dormitories, is owned and operated by the students 
to provide an outlet for student dramatic, musical, literary, technical, 
and other talents, and to furnish information, music, and entertainment 
for campus listeners. Over a hundred students participate in 
the planning and production of the daily program schedule. ~KARL 
provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio. 

#STUDENT GOVERNMENT#

THE CARLETON STUDENT ASSOCIATION includes 
all students in college and is intended "to work for the betterment 
of Carleton College by providing student government and student 
participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution 
of policies which pertain to student life and activities".

THE CARLETON SOCIAL CO-OPERATIVE is a standing committee 
of the Carleton Student Association. Week-end activities for the entire 
campus are planned by the Co-op Board.

In recent months, much attention has been given to the probable 
extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat 
divided as to the outlook for the near future. And yet, despite some 
disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new 
decade, 1960 has been a good year in many ways, with many overall measures 
of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole. The 
shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the 
present mood of caution has probably been a good thing, in that it has 
prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized 
many previous swings in the business cycle. This caution 
has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors 
to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier, and the fact 
stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because 
of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level.   In 
the electronics industry, this tendency is well illustrated by inventories 
of ~TV sets. Factory stocks in recent months have been the 
highest they have been in three years, while those at retail are below 
1959. The total value of our industry's shipments, at factory prices, 
increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion 
as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business- 
home entertainment, military, industrial, and replacement. I believe 
a further gain is in prospect for 1961. 

#HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES 
UP#

Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as 
consoles and combinations since 1953, dollar value of home entertainment 
electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion, compared to $1.7 billion 
in 1959. Sales of ~TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months 
of 1959 through July; set production (excluding those destined for 
the export market) also ran ahead in the early months, but was curtailed 
after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence 
that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic. 
For the year as a whole, retail sales of ~TV sets probably came 
to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959; however, production came 
to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million.   In contrast to the 
lower turnout of ~TV, total radio production increased from 15.4 
million sets to 16.7 million (excluding export). Both home and auto 
radios were in excellent demand, with retail sales of home sets ahead 
of 1959 in every month of the first eleven; sales and production of 
home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units. Auto set production 
came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959. Separate 
phonographs also had a good year, reflecting the growing popularity of 
stereo 
sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade 
that characterized the radio-~TV market.   The outlook 
for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present, 
but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers 
to step up their buying plans for durable goods. I would expect that 
sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 
10-15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison, 
with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business 
conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will. I 
look for ~TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 
million sets for the year, but I look for some decline in radios from 
the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0-15.5 million 
sets. I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop 
in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 
million, slightly below 1960, but above 1959. 

#MILITARY ELECTRONICS 
TO GROW#

1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's 
shipments of military electronics, which totalled about $5.4 billion 
compared to $4.9 billion in 1959. It is interesting to note that 
the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than 
the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953, which were good 
years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period 
of rapid consumer acceptance. It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed 
people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to 
expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized 
the decade of the 1950's, and that our military markets 
may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons 
systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas 
of our defense capability. While this may well be true in general, I 
believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments 
suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be 
one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding 
rapidly in other directions.   Among the items scheduled 
for acceleration in the near future are the POLARIS and ~B70 
programs, strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic 
Air Command, and improved battlefield surveillance systems. Research 
and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite 
SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile 
defense systems such as NIKE-ZEUS are expected to increase substantially. 
Research, development test and evaluation funds, devoted 
to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft, 
and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement 
by 1963. Still later, the realm of space technology will show 
substantial gains; it has been estimated that spending by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than 
$500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967, and that 
the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer 
to 50% than the current 20%.   The stepped up defense procurement 
called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself 
felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and 
the components that go into it, and it has been suggested that an additional 
$2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested 
for fiscal 1962. Although the impact of these increases on our industry's 
shipments will be gradual, on balance I look for another good 
increase in shipments in the coming year, to at least $6 billion. 

#INDUSTRIAL 
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT#

Paced by the continuing rapid growth 
of electronic data processing, sales of industrial and commercial electronic 
equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959. 
The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand 
at the rate of about 30% annually, reaching some $450 million in 
1960. Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple 
by the late 1960's, under the stimulus of new applications in 
the fields of banking and retailing, industrial process control, and information 
storage and retrieval. In the industrial field, prospects 
for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment 
are also quite bright. For the near term, however, it must be realized 
that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive 
to general business conditions than is the military market, and for this 
reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller 
than those of recent years; sales should slightly exceed 1960, however, 
and reach $1.9 billion. 

#REPLACEMENT PARTS#

In addition to 
the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business, 
the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues 
year by year. This is now a $1.0 billion business, up from $0.9 billion 
in 1959, and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961.   The markets 
for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of 
the various end equipment segments of the industry. Demand for parts 
for home entertainment was strong in the first half, but purchases were 
cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced 
their own operating rates. In the military field, incoming orders turned 
down early in the year, and remained rather slow until late fall 
when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt 
in rising orders for components.   Sales of transistors in 1960 
exceeded $300 million, compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial 
price reductions in virtually all types. Production totalled about 
123 million units against 82 million in 1959, and I look for a further 
gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961. 
Sales of passive components, such as capacitors and resistors, although 
not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 
1959 this year, and should increase again in 1961.   In sum, I 
look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961, with 
total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion, despite the uncertainties 
in the business outlook generally. As I have indicated above, 
I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market 
for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of 
the year, but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on 
to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960; on prospects 
for continued increases in defense spending; and on continued growth 
in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing 
and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's.

The appointment of Gilbert B& Devey as General Manager 
of VecTrol Engineering, Inc&, of Stamford, Connecticut, a leading 
manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical 
controls, has been announced by David B& Peck, Vice President, 
Special Products.   Mr& Devey will be responsible for the 
commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical 
power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers, 
working closely with Walter J& Brown, President and Director 
of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary. Mr& 
Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom 
design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased 
engineering staff.   Mr& Devey's new responsibilities are 
in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of 
Sprague's Special Products Group, which manufactures a wide line 
of digital electronic components, packaged component assemblies, and 
high temperature magnet wires.   Mr& Devey first came to Sprague 
in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department, 
coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington, D& 
C&, where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare 
studies. During World War /2,, he was a lieutenant commander 
in the United States Navy. Mr& Devey is a graduate of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and attended the United States 
Naval Academy Post-Graduate School specializing in electronic 
engineering. He was named Product Manager of the Special Products 
Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958, and was later promoted 
to his present post. Mr& Devey is a member of the Institute 
of Radio Engineers, and is chairman of the Electronic Industries Association 
Committee ~P-9 on Printed and Modular Components.

Mr& Brown, well-known, English-born inventor, prior to founding 
VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at 
Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co&, Ltd&; chief engineer 
of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries, Ltd&, 
the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain; 
director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain, Ltd&, and 
vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president 
at The Brush Development Co&, Cleveland, Ohio. He has a Bachelor 
of Science from the University of Manchester, England. Mr& 
Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923. 
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, 
and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers. He 
is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, a 
registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio, and a chartered 
electrical engineer in Great Britain.

The promotion of Robert E& Swift to the position of Assistant 
Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department 
was announced early in December by Frederick S& Scarborough, 
Manager of Interference Control Field Service. The appointment was 
made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers 
of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability 
problems. 
Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters. 
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential 
aide, one person, with adequate staff assistance, could fill both 
jobs. ##

<Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals 
rather than as employees, enthusiasm in a common enterprise is 
proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing 
in the decisions that govern its course>.   The faculty 
believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching 
and scholarship. The president expects faculty members to remember, 
in exercising their autonomy, that they share no collective responsibility 
for the university's income nor are they personally accountable 
for top-level decisions. He may welcome their appropriate participation 
in the determination of high policy, but he has a right to 
expect, in return, that they will leave administrative matters to the 
administration.   How well do faculty members govern themselves? 
There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought 
to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in 
government. They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than 
to their own internal problems of government. They, too, need to learn 
to delegate. Letting the administration take details off their hands 
would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a 
whole, an area that would benefit by more faculty attention.   Although 
faculties insist on governing themselves, they grant little prestige 
to a member who actively participates in college or university 
government. There are, nevertheless, several things that the president 
can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those 
who are willing to exercise their privilege. He can, for example, 
present significant university-wide issues to the senate. He can encourage 
quality in faculty committee work in various ways: by seeing to 
it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as 
well as the action-oriented faculty; by making certain that no faculty 
member has too many committee assignments; by assuring good liaison 
between the committees and the administration; by minimizing the 
number of committees.   Despite the many avenues for the exchange 
of ideas between faculty and administration, complaints of a lack 
of communication persist. The cause is as often neglect as hesitance 
to disclose. A busy president, conversant with a problem and its ramifications 
and beset by pressures to meet deadlines, tends naturally to 
assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is. The 
need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all 
methods of consultation.   To increase faculty influence and decrease 
tension, many presidents have established a standing advisory 
committee with which they can discuss problems frankly.   The president 
has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes, but if 
he looks ahead two, three, or five years to anticipate issues and throw 
out challenging ideas, he can open the way for innovation, and he can 
also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take. Success 
will require tact, sensitivity to faculty prerogatives, patience, and 
persistence. ##

<The critical task for every president and his 
academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university 
continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance 
will match changing social demands **h great professors do not automatically 
reproduce themselves>.   Deans can form an important bridge 
between the president and the faculty. They serve not only as spokesmen 
for their areas, but they also contribute to top-level decision 
making. The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college 
or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration 
can count on useful assistance.   Faculty members depend on 
their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration. 
The administration at the same time, looks to the chairmen 
for strategic aid in building stronger departments. One way that this 
can be done, other than by hiring new high-priced professors, is by constantly 
encouraging the department members to raise their standards 
of performance.   The quality of a president's leadership is 
measured first by his success in building up the faculty. By supporting 
the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever 
higher standards, the president can encourage faculty leadership. 
Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for 
appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to.

The academic dean should take a direct, long-term interest in faculty 
development. An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel 
needs, plans for the future, qualifications of those on the job, 
and bright prospects elsewhere.   For the maintenance of a long-term 
program, the departments, and particularly their chairmen, are 
strategic. They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and 
promotion. To provide an independent judgment for the president, the 
academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly.   At some 
colleges and universities, a faculty committee reviews and reports 
to the administration on the qualifications of candidates. Some faculty 
members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because 
they either repeat department's actions or act <pro forma>. They 
can be effective, however, if their members set high standards for candidates 
and devote substantial time to the work. At one university, 
the president cites the faculty review committee as "a valued partner 
of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the 
faculty".   Before the president recommends a candidate to the 
trustees, the administration collects the views of colleagues in the 
same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere. The president or dean 
reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation 
of the quality of his mind. No good way to evaluate teaching ability 
has yet been discovered, although some institutions use inventory sheets 
for a list of criteria. To avoid passing over quiet, unaggressive 
teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion, review 
of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should 
be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for 
advancement by their departments.   There are certain aspects of 
personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly. 
He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member 
proposed for tenure, to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly 
serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements. 
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older 
men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to 
their specialties is quite different. In particular, the president 
may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members 
to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale. On 
those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the 
standards of the institution, the president must also bear the ultimate 
burden of decision and action. ##

<A true university, like most 
successful marriages, is a unity of diversities **h Without forcing 
all components into a single pattern, the preparation of a master plan 
is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest 
level, which a university- in contrast to a multiversity- should 
stand for>.   Recently colleges and universities have begun 
to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals. 
Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as: 
Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core 
for all undergraduates? Or shall we permit early specialization in 
scientific and technological subjects? In the first instance, adequate 
appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be 
planned. In the second, more shops, laboratories, and staff will be required.

For the president, a master plan looking ahead five years 
(the maximum reach for sound forecasting), offers several practical 
advantages. Trustees, faculty, and administration can consider the 
consequences of decisions before they are made, instead of afterwards. 
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed. Proposed 
new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present 
and future financial fitness. More than one president has found 
that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts. It inspires 
confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and 
to achieve them.   Before deciding where it is going, however, 
a college 
or university must know where it is. The first step is a comprehensive 
self study made by faculty, by outside consultants, or by a combination 
of the two. It should sternly appraise curricula, faculty, organization, 
buildings, faculty work loads, and potential for growth in 
stature and size.   Implementation of the master plan will inevitably 
be uneven. Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically; 
others may drag their feet. Funds may be readily donated 
for some purposes but not others. A plan must therefore be brought 
up to date periodically, possibly with the assistance of a permanent 
planning officer.   To provide the continuous flow of information 
basic to administrative decisions, a number of institutions have established 
offices of institutional research. Some offices have very broad 
responsibilities, touching on almost all aspects of a university's 
instructional program. Their duties include evaluation of the information 
collected and preparation of recommendations. More often, these 
offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data. ## 
**h <the president's opportunity for influencing education reaches 
its highest point, as he decides which projects he will cut back, which 
he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts>.

No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators, budget 
making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents. When 
the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget, 
to which his faith and credit are committed; its principal features 
should be a product of his most considered judgment. He cannot, 
of course, examine each proposal from scratch. He reviews and shapes 
the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote 
the aims of the institution.   Budgeting must be flexible to 
allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological 
scholarship. Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly 
large sums of money, an institution should choose its fields 
of prominence. Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy, at worst, 
and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and 
culturally indispensable branches of learning. In the national interest 
even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor 
among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses 
in all branches. ##

<Supporting activities- business 
management, public relations, fund-raising- offer presidents one of 
their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education **h Here 
the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much 
to free a president for his primary role>.   In the areas that 
do 
not relate directly to the educational program, expert subordinates will 
serve the college or university better than close presidential attention. 
The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the 
widest discretion to them. Higher education cannot compete with the 
salary scales of the business world, but an educational institution can 
offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business 
community that will offset the differences in income.   Just as 
the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy 
and objectives, so should non-academic officers. They will better 
understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program 
and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of 
mutual goals.   A president is frequently besieged to serve in 
non-academic civic and governmental capacities, to make speeches to lay 
groups, and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus. 
Since he can neither accept nor reject them all, he must be governed 
by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations. 
Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains 
why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance.

By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues, 
the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to 
create a public perception of the university as an institution, something 
more than the lengthened shadow of one man. 

#1. INTRODUCTION#

IT HAS recently become practical to use the 
radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information 
about these bodies and their atmospheres. The results of present observations 
of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with 
the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived 
from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses (e&g&, 
Garstung, 1958). When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements 
are available, it will be possible to set limits on the thermal 
and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials 
of the moon.   Observations of the radio emission of a planet 
which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater 
extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases 
give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics 
of the solid surface. Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have 
already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions 
of these planets. The observed intensity of the radio emission of 
Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity, although the 
spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 ~cm and 
1o ~cm is like that of a black body at about 6oo` ~K. This result 
suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet, 
although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be 
a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the 
observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence. For 
the case of Jupiter, the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like 
the spectrum of a black-body radiator, and it seems very likely that 
the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation 
from the atmosphere and non-thermal components.   Of the remaining 
planets, only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources, 
and not very much information is available. Mars has been observed 
twice at about 3-~cm wave length, and the intensity of the observed 
radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which 
might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars. 
The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations, 
but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal 
origin. No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining 
planets have been reported, and, because of their distances, small 
diameters, or low temperatures, the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths 
reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very 
low intensity. In spite of this, the very large radio reflectors and 
improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should 
make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets 
in a few years.   The study of the radio emission of the moon 
and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon 
at 1.25-~cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer (1946). This was 
followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-~cm 
emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett 
(1949). They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission 
from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly 
sinusoidal fashion; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably 
less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission 
as measured by Pettit and Nicholson (1930) and Pettit (1935); 
and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after 
Full 
Moon, which is again in contrast to the infrared emission, which reaches 
its maximum at Full Moon. Piddington and Minnett explained 
their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely 
to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent 
to radio waves, although opaque to infrared radiation. The infrared 
emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon, 
while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface, 
where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced 
in amplitude and shifted in phase. Since the absorption of radio waves 
in rocklike material varies with wave length, it should be possible 
to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface 
and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the 
lunar surface material.   The radio emission of a planet was 
first detected in 1955, when Burke and Franklin (1955) identified the 
origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15 
meters wave length as emission from Jupiter. This sporadic type of 
planetary radiation is discussed by Burke (chap& 13) and Gallet (chap& 
14). Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was 
observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 ~cm, and from Mars and Jupiter 
at 3.15 ~cm in 1956 (Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958<a, 
b, c>), and from Saturn at 3.75 ~cm in 1957 (Drake and Ewen, 
1958). In the relatively short time since these early observations, 
Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 
0.8 to 10.2 ~cm, and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length 
range from 3.03 to 68 ~cm.   The observable characteristics of 
planetary radio radiation are the intensity, the polarization, and the 
direction of arrival of the waves. The maximum angular diameter of 
any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc. 
This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very 
large reflectors now under construction, and consequently the radio emission 
of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved. It should 
be possible, however, to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio 
sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers. 
Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity 
and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the 
planetary radiation at the earth. There have been few measurements specifically 
for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation. 
The measurements made with the ~NRL 50-foot reflector, 
which is altitude-azimuth-mounted, would have shown a systematic change 
with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter 
if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized. 
Recent interferometer measurements (Radhakrishnan and Roberts, 
1960) have shown the 960-~Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially 
polarized 
and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible 
disk. Other than this very significant result, most of the information 
now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted 
to the intensity of the radiation.   The concept of apparent 
black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from 
the moon and the planets. The received radiation is compared with the 
radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid 
angle as the visible disk of the planet. The <apparent black-body 
disk temperature> is the temperature which must be assumed for the 
black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that 
of the observed radiation. The use of this concept does not specify 
the origin of the radiation, and only if the planet really radiates 
as a black body, will the apparent black-body temperature correspond 
to the physical temperature of the emitting material.   The radio 
radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should 
be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter 
wave lengths, except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar 
radio noise. The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation 
would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less 
than 1` ~K. At meter wave lengths and increase of the order of 
10` ~K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would 
be expected. Therefore, neglecting the extreme outbursts, reflected 
solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements 
of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length 
range. 

#2. THE MOON#

_2.1 OBSERVATIONS_ Radio observations 
of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 ~mm 
to 75 ~cm, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Observations 
have also been made at 1.5 ~mm using optical techniques (Sinton, 
1955, 1956,; see also chap& 11). Not all the observers have used 
the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness 
distribution when reducing the data, and this, together with 
differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers, 
must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness 
temperatures.   In the observations at 4.3 ~mm (Coates, 
1959<a>), the diameter of the antenna beam, 6'.7, was small enough 
to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface, 
and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution 
at three lunar phases. These observations indicate that the lunar 
maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do 
the mountainous regions. Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and 
remains cooler than the regions which surround it. These contour diagrams 
also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with 
latitude.   Very recently, observations have been made at 8-~mm 
wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant 
beam width of only about 2' (Amenitskii, Noskova, and Salomonovich, 
1960). The constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those 
observed at 4.3 ~mm by Coates (1959<a>), and apparently the emission 
at 8 ~mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface 
features. Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several 
wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can 
be properly 
interpreted.   The observations of Mayer, McCullough, 
and Sloanaker at 3.15 ~cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 ~cm have not 
previously 
been published and will be briefly described. Measurements 
at 3.15 ~cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 
to June 19, 1956, using the 50-foot reflector at the U& S& Naval 
Research Laboratory in Washington. The half-intensity diameter 
of the antenna beam was about 9', and the angle subtended by the moon 
included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes. The 
antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both 
measured (Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958<b>), so that 
the 
absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle 
of the moon was known. The ratio of the measured antenna temperature 
change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature 
of the moon over the antenna beam (assuming that the brightness 
temperature of the sky is negligible) was found, by graphical integration 
of the antenna directivity diagram, to be 0.85. The measured 
brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature 
at the <center of the lunar disk> because of the narrow antenna 
beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion 
of the moon's disk is nearly uniform. The result of the observations 
is (in ` ~K) **f where the phase angle, |q<t>, is measured 
in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute 
as well as relative errors. This result is plotted along with the 8.6-~mm 
observations of Gibson (1958) in figure 1, <a>. The variation 
in the 3-~cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much 
less than the variation in the 8.6-~mm emission, as would be expected 
from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett (1949). In the discussion 
which follows, the time average of the radio emission will be 
referred to as the <constant component>, and the superimposed periodic 
variation will be called the <variable component>.   The 10.3-~cm 
observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20, 1958, using the 
84-foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U& 
S& Naval Research Laboratory. The age of the moon was about 2 
days. The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was 
about 18'.5, and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming 
a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for 
the moon. 

#ABSTRACT#

Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous 
graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas (Argon). Thus, the 
energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into 
the arc. It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss 
of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the 
total arc energy A detailed energy balance of the anode was established. 
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount. The dependence 
of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating 
gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 
100 ~Amp and 200 ~Amp. Qualitative observations were made and 
high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the 
arc at various mass flow velocities.

The high heat 
fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate 
extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation. The cooling requirements 
are particularly severe at the anode. In free burning electric 
arcs, for instance, approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred 
to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of 
**f as measured by the authors- the exact value depending on the arc 
atmosphere. In plasma generators as currently commercially available 
for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 
50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the co0ling 
medium of the anode.   The higher heat transfer rates at the anode 
compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical 
phenomena occurring in free burning arcs. In plasma generators the 
superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat. The heat
