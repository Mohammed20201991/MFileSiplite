transfer to the anode is due to the following effects: 1. Heat 
of condensation (work function) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging 
on the anode. This energy transfer depends on the current, the 
temperature in the arc column, the anode material, and the conditions 
in the anode sheath. 2. Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well 
as by radiation from the arc column.   The heat transfer to 
the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from 
the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f. This phenomenon 
has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker (Ref& 
1). The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the 
magnetic field in the arc (rapid decrease of current density from cathode 
to the anode). Hence, the flow conditions at the anode of free 
burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point.   it is apparent 
from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements 
for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with 
those for the cathode. The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify 
these conditions; however, the anode is still the part receiving 
the largest heat flux. An attempt to improve the life of the anodes 
or the efficiency of the plasma generators must, therefore, aim at 
a reduction of the anode loss. The following possibilities exist for 
achieving this: 1. The use of high voltages and low currents by proper 
design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given 
power output. 2. Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode 
by flow or magnetic forces. 3. Feed back of the energy transferred 
to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode. 
The third method was, to our knowledge, successfully applied for the 
first time by C& Sheer and co-workers (Ref& 2). The purpose of 
the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish 
an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect 
of blowing on the arc voltage. Gas injection through a porous anode 
(transpiration cooling) not only feeds back the energy transferred 
to the anode by the above mentioned processes, but also modifies the conditions 
in the arc itself. A detailed study of this latter phenomenon 
was not attempted in this paper. Argon was used as a blowing gas to 
exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction. The anode 
material was porous graphite. Sintered porous metals should be usable 
in principle. However, technical difficulties arise by melting at local 
hot spots. The experimental arrangement as described below is based 
on the geometry of free burning arcs. Thus, direct comparisons can 
be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during 
the past years and decades by numerous investigators (Ref& 3). 

#EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS#

Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic 
views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode 
holder. The cathode consisted of a 1/4'' diameter thoriated tungsten 
rod attached to a water cooled copper tube. This tube could be 
adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the 
required electrode spacing. The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means 
of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk. The 
transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially 
towards the cathode below. Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere 
was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2. Argon was also 
blown at low velocities (mass flow rate **f) through a tube coaxial 
with 
the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the 
arc by air. The anode consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite 
plug, 1/4 inch long. The graphite was National Carbon ~NC 
60, which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 This 
small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving 
the anode. The anode plug (Figure 2) was inserted into a carbon 
anode holder. A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream 
temperature of the transpiring gas. It was exposed to a high velocity 
gas jet. A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided 
the chamber above the porous plug into two parts. This arrangement 
had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by 
natural convection. Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 (Pyrometer 
Instrument Co& Model 95) served for simultaneous measurement of 
the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along 
the anode holder. Three thermocouples were placed at different locations 
in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its 
temperature.   Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown 
in figure 3. In this design the anode holder is water cooled and 
the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring 
the temperature rise of the coolant. To reduce heat transfer from 
the hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc, a carbon 
shield was attached tothe surface providing an air gap of 1/16 
inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder. In addition, 
the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil 
to reduce radiation. Temperatures of the shield and of the surface 
of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account 
for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode 
plug.   The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated 
by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator. The power 
source was a commercial D& C& rectifier. At 100 ~Amp the 
360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 ~V (peak to peak) with a resistive 
load. The current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and 
measured with a 50 ~mV shunt and millivoltmeter. The arc voltage 
was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode 
and cathode holders. Because of the falling characteristic of the 
rectifier, no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation. 
A high frequency starter was used to start the arc. 

#EXPERIMENTAL 
PROCEDURE AND ERROR ANALYSIS#

_1. TRANSPIRATION COOLED ANODE WITH 
CARBON ANODE HOLDER_ The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed 
with two goals in mind. The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced 
as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat 
balance can be made. In order to reduce the number of variable parameters, 
all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5'' 
and a current of 100 ~Amp. The argon flow through the porous anode 
was varied systematically between **f. and **f. The lower limit 
was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started 
to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug 
and that it became highly unstable. The upper limit was determined by 
the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature 
(see below) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the 
arc. This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the 
anode surface changed size and location continuously.   For each 
mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured. To measure the surface 
temperature of the anode plug, the surface was scanned with a pyrometer. 
As it turned out, a very hot region occurred on the plug. Its temperature 
was denoted by **f. The size of this hot region was estimated 
by eye. The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards 
the outer diameter of the plug. The mean temperature of this region 
was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the 
edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug. It was denoted by **f. 
The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to 
the following relation: **f where ~x is the fraction of the plug area 
covered by the hot spot. Assuming thermal equilibrium between the 
anode surface and the transpiring argon, the gas enthalpy rise through 
the anode was calculated according to the relation **f whereby the specific 
heat of argon was taken as **f. This calculation results in 
an 
enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally 
distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass 
velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.

The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple 
shown in figure 2 was **f. The **f values are listed in Table 1 
together 
with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages. Simultaneously 
with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer 
readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode 
holder as indicated on figure 2. Some of these temperatures are plotted 
in figure 4. They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate 
within the accuracy of these measurements. Thus, the dotted line shown 
in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for 
all blowing rates.   The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown 
in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of 
**f. This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which 
the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned. It 
is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode 
holder, to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward 
the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements. 
The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder 
and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also 
be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces 
and of the specific geometry. The total heat loss through the anode 
holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical 
piece into the adjacent metal parts. It was calculated from the 
temperature gradient **f at **f inch as **f. The total heat flux from 
the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby **f The temperature 
distribution of figure 4 gives **f for all blowing rates, assuming **f. 
The temperature dependent value of ~|e was taken from Ref& 
7. The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to 
**f where **f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures **f 
and **f calculated analogously to equation (1).

A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2. It consists of two blocks 
with flat surfaces held apart by shims. There is a small well in 
the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed. A tape 
of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the 
fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks. In 
normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull 
the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks. After it 
has reached terminal velocity, the time for the tape to travel a known 
distance is recorded. By the use of various weights, data for a force-rate 
of shear graph can be obtained. The instrument used for this 
work was a slight modification of that previously described.   In 
this test a **f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and 
pulley at a rate of **f with a clearance of 0.002'' on each side of 
the tape. This gives a rate of shear of **f. This, however, can only 
be considered 
approximate, as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the 
build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley 
during the runs. The face of one block contained a hole 1/16'' 
in diameter which led to a 
manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure.   Although 
there were only four fluids tested, it was apparent that there were 
two distinct types. Two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure 
when undergoing shear, and two showed small negative pressures 
which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures 
generated by the other two.   Figure 3 shows the data on 
a silicone fluid, labeled 12,500 ~cps which gave a high positive normal 
pressure. Although the tape was run for over 1 hr&, a steady 
state was not reached, and it was concluded that the reason for this was 
that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material 
fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow 
rate. A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of 
the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure 
were to be made in a reasonable time. A back pressure was then introduced, 
and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated 
which was greater, the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure. 
By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted 
by a sample of polybutene (molecular weight reported to be 770) was 
over half an atmosphere. The actual pressure was not determined because 
the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand.

The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes 
with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300. 
These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more 
Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight. The maximum suction 
was 3.25'' of test fluid measured from the top of the block, 
and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids. It is presumed 
that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor 
of the assembly, since different readings were obtained with the same 
fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly 
of the apparatus. This negative pressure is not explained by the 
velocity head **f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings 
by several magnitudes.   These experiments can be considered 
exploratory only. However, they do demonstrate the presence of large 
normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast 
by the theory in the first part of the paper. They also give information 
which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument 
for the measurement of the normal pressures. Such an instrument would 
be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well 
as theoretical studies. The elasticity as a parameter of fluids 
which 
is not subject to simple measurement at present, and it is a parameter 
which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial 
materials. Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful 
if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as 
printing inks, paints, adhesives, molten plastics, and bread dough, for 
the elasticity is related to those various properties termed "length", 
"shortness", "spinnability", etc&, which are usually judged 
by subjective methods at present.   The actual change **f 
caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential 
times the volume, just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic 
pressure head. If the volume is the molal volume, then **f is obtained 
on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists.

Although the **f calculation is obvious by analogy with that 
for gravitational field and osmotic pressure, it is interesting to confirm 
it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects. 
Consider a shear field with a height of ~<H> and a cross-sectional 
area of ~<A> opposed by a manometer with a height of ~<h> 
(referred to the same base as ~<H>) and a cross-sectional area 
of ~<a>. If **f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function 
caused by the shear field at constant ~<P> and ~<T>, and ~|r 
is the density of the fluid, then the total potential energy of 
the system above the reference height is **f. **f is the work necessary 
to fill the manometer column from the reference height to ~<h>. 
The total volume of the system above the reference height is **f, and 
~<h> can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential 
energy of the system in terms of ~<H>. The minimum total potential 
energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to ~<H> 
and equating to zero. This gives **f, which is the pressure. This 
is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum 
Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential 
energy for equilibrium. This method can be extended to include the 
concentration differences caused by shear fields. The relation between 
osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an 
analogous way.   In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics 
of equilibrium (referred to by some as thermostatics) to 
the steady state. This can be justified thermodynamically in this case, 
and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared. 
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff 
that "the deformational mechanics of <elastic solids> can be 
applied to flowing solutions". There is one exception to the above 
statement as has been pointed out, and that is that fluids can relax 
by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear, so the statement should 
be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar. If the mechanics 
are similar, we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also 
be similar.   The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function 
difference **f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is 
compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies 
of fluids undergoing shear. Essentially these birefringence studies 
show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45` to 
the direction of shear, and as the rate of shear increases, the direction 
of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction 
of shear. According to Philippoff, the recoverable shear ~<s> is 
given by **f where ~|c is the angle of extinction. From this and 
the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic 
energy of deformation which should be equal to the **f calculated from 
the pressure normal to the shearing face.   There is another 
means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses 
in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature, 
and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids 
in shear fields. These droplets are distorted by the normal forces 
just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's 
hands. These droplets appear to be ellipsoids, and it is mathematically 
convenient to assume that they are. If they are not ellipsoids, 
the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation. The direction of 
the tension of minimum pressure is, of course, given by the direction 
of the major axis of the ellipsoids. Mason and Taylor both show that 
the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45` at low rates of shear and 
that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear. 
(Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction 
of shear, and some become asymptotic to it without breakup.) This is, 
of course, a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence 
studies. The relative forces can be calculated from the various 
radii of curvature if we assume: (<A>) The surface tension is uniform 
on the surface of the drop. (<B>) That because of the low viscosity 
of the fluid, the internal pressure is the same in all directions. 
(<C>) The kinetic effects are negligible. (<D>) Since the 
shape of the drop conforms to the force field, it does not appreciably 
affect the distribution of forces in the fluid.   These are reasonable 
assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity 
fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear. Just as the pressure 
exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is **f and the pressure 
exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is **f, the 
pressure exerted by any curved surface is **f, where ~|g is the interfacial 
tension and **f and **f are the two radii of curvature. This 
formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason. If ~<a> is the major 
axis of an ellipsoid and ~<b> and ~<c> are the other two axes, 
the radius of curvature in the ~<ab> plane at the end of the axis 
is **f, and the difference in pressure along the ~<a> and ~<b> 
axes is **f.   There are no data published in the literature on 
the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas. However, 
there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate 
(viscosity 155 poises) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper 
by Mason and Bartok. This viscosity of the material in the drops 
is, of course, not negligible. Measurements on the photograph in this 
paper give **f at the maximum rate of shear of **f. If it is assumed 
that the formula given by Lodge of **f, cosec 2~|c applies, the 
pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle 
of inclination of the major axis, and from this the interfacial tension 
can be calculated. Its value was **f from the above data. This 
appears to be high, as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity 
of the material in the drops.   It is appropriate to call attention 
to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous 
to rubber-like deformation. The internal energy of an ideal 
gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume. 
In other words, if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant 
temperature, the work done in compressing it is completely converted 
into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink. This means that 
work equals ~<q> which in turn equals **f.   There is a 
well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that 
**f, where ~\q is the probability that state (i&e&, volume 
for an ideal gas) could be reached by chance alone. this is known as 
conformational entropy. This conformational entropy is, in this case, 
equal to the usual entropy, for there are no other changes or other 
energies involved. Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no 
additional energy, the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure. 
The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come 
as thermal energy from its surroundings. 
##

A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a 
function of magnetic field and temperature is presented. **f is paramagnetic, 
and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects 
lead to line broadening. The lines are asymmetric and over the 
range of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry increases with 
increasing **f and decreasing <T>. An isotropic resonance shift 
of **f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine 
contact interaction. The general theory of resonance shifts is used to 
derive a general expression for the second moment **f of a polycrystalline 
paramagnetic sample and is specialized to **f. The theory predicts 
a linear dependence of **f on **f, where |j is the experimentally 
determined Curie-Weiss constant. The experimental second moment 
**f conforms to the relation **f in agreement with theory. Hence, the 
electron paramagnetic effects (slope) can be separated from the nuclear 
effects (intercept). The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some 
information on the particle shapes. The nuclear dipole effects provide 
some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei, but the symmetry 
of the **f bond in **f remains in doubt. 

#INTRODUCTION#

THE 
magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a 
tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei. It 
is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since 
quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations 
of structure. **f appeared to be well suited for the study 
of these matters, since it is a normal paramagnet, with three unpaired 
electrons on the chromium, its crystal structure is very simple, 
and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provides 
structural interest.   We first discuss the **f bond in **f. 
We 
then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles 
with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment. 
Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from 
nuclear effects. The information provided by the electron paramagnetic 
effects is then discussed, and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted 
in terms of various motional-modified models of the **f bond 
in **f. #**F BOND IN **F#

Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond 
generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of 
peculiarities of packing in the solid. Moreover, it will be asymmetric 
until a certain critical **f distance is reached, below which it will 
become symmetric. There is ample evidence from many sources that the 
**f bond in **f is symmetric. The **f distance in **f is 2.26 ~A. 
There is evidence, though less convincing than for **f, that the **f 
bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric. Here the **f distance 
is 2.44 ~A. A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers 
lead to the conclusion that the **f bond becomes symmetric when the 
**f bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 ~A, but aside from the possible 
example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports 
of symmetric **f bonds. Douglass has studied the crystal structure 
of **f by x-ray diffraction. He finds the structure contains an **f 
bond with the **f distance of **f. There is, then, the possibility that 
this **f bond is symmetric, although Douglass was unable to determine 
its symmetry from his x-ray data.   Douglass found **f to be 
trigonal, Laue symmetry **f, with **f, **f. X-ray and experimental 
density showed one formula unit in the unit cell, corresponding to a paramagnetic 
ion density of **f. The x-ray data did not permit Douglass 
to determine uniquely the space group, but a negative test for piezoelectricity 
led him to assume a center of symmetry. Under this assumption 
the space group must be **f and the following are the positions 
of the atoms in the unit cell. **f. This space group requires the hydrogen 
bond to be symmetric. Douglass found powder intensity calculations 
and measurements to agree best for **f. These data lead to a structure 
in which sheets of ~Cr atoms lie between two sheets of ~O 
atoms. The ~O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each ~Cr 
atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of ~O atoms. The **f 
layers are stacked normal to the [111] axis with the lower oxygens 
of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower 
layer, in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers. The 
separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds. A drawing of the 
structure is to be found in reference 6.   The gross details 
of the structure appear reasonable. The structure appears to be unique 
among ~<R>OOH compounds, but is the same as that assumed by 
**f. The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits 
and the volume per oxygen is about normal. However, the possible absence 
of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off **f, 
but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent, with **f at 
**f and **f at **f (space group **f), where **f represents the oxygens 
on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side. However, 
any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely 
short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 ~A or the non-hydrogen-bonded 
**f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 
~A. Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in 
this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence. 
The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release 
the hydrogen atoms to occupy general, rather than special, positions 
along the [111] axis.   If the **f bond is linear then there 
are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms: (1) The hydrogen 
atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the 
oxygen sheets; (2) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet, but the sheet 
is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other; (3) hydrogen atoms 
are asymmetrically placed, either randomly or in an ordered way, so 
that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others 
are closer to the lower oxygen atoms. Position (2) appears to us 
to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on 
general chemical structural grounds. A randomization of "ups" and 
"downs" is more likely than ordered "ups" and "downs" in 
position (3) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the 
position of one could hardly affect the position of another, and also 
since ordered "up" and "down" implies a larger unit cell, for 
which no evidence exists. Therefore, the only unknown structural feature 
would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically 
(1) or asymmetrically (3). 

#EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES#

_SAMPLES_ 
Douglass prepared his sample of **f by thermal decomposition of 
aqueous chromic acid at 300-325`~C. Dr& Douglass was kind enough 
to lend us about 5 grams of his material. This material proved 
to be unsatisfactory, since we could not obtain reproducible results on 
various portions of the sample. Subsequently, we learned from Douglass 
that his sample contained a few percent **f impurity. Since **f 
is ferromagnetic, we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically 
contaminated **f would be suspect.   Plane suggested another 
preparation of **f which we used here. 500 ~ml of 1~<M> aqueous 
**f 
with 1 ~g **f added are heated in a bomb at 170`~C for 48 hours. 
A very fine, gray solid (about 15 ~g) is formed, water-washed 
by centrifugation, and dried at 110`~C.   Differential thermal 
analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340`~C and 
a large endothermic reaction at 470`~C. This latter reaction is 
in accord with the reported decomposition of **f. Thermogravimetric analysis 
showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337`~C and another 
weight loss of 10.8% at 463`~C. The expected weight loss for 
**f going to **f and **f is 10.6%. Mass spectrometric analysis of 
gases evolved upon heating to 410`~C indicated nitrogen oxides 
and water vapor. The small reaction occurring at 337`~C is probably 
caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates, and perhaps by a small 
amount of some hydrous material other than **f. All subsequent measurements 
were made on material which had been heated to 375`~C for 
one hour. Emission spectra indicated **f calcium and all other impurities 
much lower. Chromium analysis gave 58.8% ~Cr as compared 
with 61.2% theory. However, **f adsorbs water from the atmosphere and 
this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight 
loss.   The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material, taken with 
~CuK|a radiation, indicated the presence of no extra lines and 
was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass. Magnetic analyses 
by R& G& Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic 
impurities. **f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired 
electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of **f, 
where **f. For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would 
be 3.10. An infrared spectrum, obtained by H& A& Benesi and 
R& G& Snyder of this laboratory, showed bands in the positions 
found by Jones.   Electron microscopic examination of the **f 
sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3|m 
in diameter. The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal 
domains are smaller than this. The x-ray data are consistent 
with particle sizes of 1000 ~A or greater. We found no obvious 
effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample 
nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron 
microscopic examination. 

#NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (~NMR) 
MEASUREMENTS# 

The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing 
a Varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch 
electromagnet system. One measurement at 40 ~Mc/sec was obtained 
with the Varian model **f unit. A bridged-<T> type of bridge was 
used in the 10-16 ~Mc/sec range. The ~rf power level was maintained 
small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions 
by saturation effects. A modulation frequency of 40 ~cps with an 
amplitude as small as possible, commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise 
quality, was used. Background spectra were obtained in 
all cases. The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion 
mode mixed in with the absorption signal.   A single value 
of the thermal relaxation time **f at room temperature was measured 
by the progressive saturation method. The value of **f estimated at 
470 gauss was **f microseconds. A single measurement of the spin-spin 
relaxation time **f was obtained at 10 ~Mc/sec by pulse methods. 
This measurement was obtained by W& Blumberg of the University of 
California, Berkeley, by observing the breadth of the free induction 
decay signal. The value derived was 16 microseconds.   Field 
shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line, defined 
as the field about which the first moment is zero.   Second moments 
of the spectra were computed by numerical integration. Corrections 
were applied for modulation broadening, apparatus background, and 
field shift.   Spectra were obtained over the temperature range 
of 77-294`K. For the low-temperature measurements the sample was 
cooled 
by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and 
Eades. The temperature was maintained to within about **f for the 
period of time required to make the measurement (usually about one hour). 
One sample, which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation 
at 375`~C, showed the presence of adsorbed water (about 0.3 
~wt %) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow 
at room temperature and which disappeared, due to broadening, at low 
temperature. The data reported here are either from spectra from which 
the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra 
of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375`~C which contain no 
adsorbed water.   The measured powder density of the **f used 
here was about **f, approximately one-third that of the crystal density 
(**f). Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of 
about **f.   Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having 
the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio 
of 4:1. The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical. 
Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container 
which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass 
tube. The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were 
taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary. Spectra 
were also obtained from a third sample of **f which had been diluted 
to three times its original volume with powdered, anhydrous alundum 
(**f). This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to 
that described above. 
Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants 
were a threat though expensive, and these same polyphosphates 
spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates 
and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited.

The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse. The best 
known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty, spray-dried 
detergent formulations for household use. These widely advertised 
products, which are used primarily for washing clothes, are based on 
high-sudsing, 
synthetic organic actives (sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates) 
and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture 
of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate. In the 
household market, there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations 
based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder; 
light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder; and the 
dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules, none 
of which are now nationally advertised. A well-publicized entrant 
which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent, 
with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and 
active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder/active 
ratio.   Hard-surface cleaning in household application is 
represented by two classes of alkaline products: (1) the formulations 
made expressly for machine dishwashers, and (2) the general-purpose 
cleaners used for walls and woodwork. The better quality products in 
both of these lines contain phosphate builders. In addition, many of 
the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis 
in trisodium orthophosphate, which is still the major ingredient of 
a number of such products. Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates. 
These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28. 

#THE 
CLEANING PROCESS#

Cleaning or detergent action is entirely 
a matter of surfaces. Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium, a solid 
substrate, soil to be removed, and the detergent or surface-active 
material. An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface 
cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved. One 
gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of **f. 
In contrast, a metal coupon **f in size would have a magnitude from 
100,000 to a million less. Even here there is room for some variation, 
for metal surfaces vary in smoothness, absorptive capacity, and chemical 
reactivity. Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning 
study and showed considerable differences in soil removal, depending 
upon surface roughness. There are considerable differences between 
the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning. Exclusive 
of esthetic values, such as high- or low-foam level, perfume content, 
etc&, the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles 
are high. No matter how they are formulated, a large number of organic 
actives are simply not suitable for this application, since they 
do not give adequate soil removal. This is best demonstrated by practical 
washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with 
the same detergent formulation. A good formulation will keep the clothes 
clean and white after many washings; whereas, with a poor formulation, 
the clothes exhibit a build-up of "tattle-tale grey" and dirty 
spots- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash. Since 
practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive, a number 
of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation 
of detergents. Harris has indicated that two devices, the Launder-Ometer 
and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent 
testing, and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled 
fabrics. Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general 
use. The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations 
are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by 
even the best detergent formulation in a single wash. In this way, 
numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations 
can be obtained by measuring the reflectance (whiteness) of the 
cloth swatches before and after washing. Soil redeposition is evaluated 
by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones. As is the case with 
the surface-active agent, the requirements for builders to be used in 
detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high. Large numbers 
of potential builders have been investigated, but none have been 
found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide 
range of conditions met in practice.   The problems of hard-surface 
cleaning are not nearly as complex. In hard-surface cleaning, the 
inorganic salts are more important than the organic active. Indeed, 
when the proper inorganic constituents are employed, practically any 
wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present 
in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation. Hydroxides, 
orthophosphates, borates, carbonates, and silicates are important 
inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners. In addition, the 
polyphosphates are also used, probably acting more as peptizing agents 
than anything else. The importance of the inorganic constituents in 
hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers. 

#PHYSICAL 
CHEMISTRY OF WASHING#

Although there is no question 
but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena 
which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that 
these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the 
present, this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture 
of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces. 
The purpose of washing is, obviously, to remove soils which are arbitrarily 
classed in the four major categories given below: _1._ 
Dirt, which is here defined as particulate material which is usually 
inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit 
colloidal properties. _2._ Greasy soils, which are typified by 
hydrocarbons and fats (esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids). 
_3._ Stains, which include the wide variety of nonparticulate 
materials which give color even when present in very low concentration 
on the soiled object. _4._ Miscellaneous soils, which primarily 
include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave 
a residue.   The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically 
held by surface irregularities to some extent. However, a major factor 
in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under 
the name of van der Waal's forces. This is a theoretically complicated 
dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle 
to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles, or to stick 
to an uncharged surface. Obviously, if colloidal particles bear charges 
of opposite sign or, if one kind is charged and the other kind is 
not, the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate 
will be greatly reinforced. Likewise, a charged particle will tend 
to stick to an uncharged surface and <vice versa>, and a charged particle 
will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite 
charge. In addition, dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface 
by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids, including 
liquid greases.   Greases, stains, and miscellaneous soils 
are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface. In most cases, these soils 
are taken up as liquids through capillary action. In an essentially 
static system, an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless 
the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active 
agent.   The washing process whereby soils are removed consists 
basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles 
and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off 
the debris and acts, to some extent, as a dissolving and solvating 
agent. Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water; 
and 
natural waters, in addition, often contain impurities such as calcium 
salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove. 
Therefore, detergents are used. The detergent active is that substance 
which primarily acts to remove greasy soils. The other constituents 
in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains 
and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils.   As is well known, 
detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately 
high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the 
property of forming micelles in solution. Physicochemical investigations 
of anionic surfactants, including the soaps, have shown that there 
is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below 
a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration. 
(1) Below the critical micelle concentration, monomers and some 
dimers are present. (2) In the critical micelle region, there is 
a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles, which have 
a degree of polymerization averaging around 60-80. (3) For anionics, 
these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which 
the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups (the ionized 
ends) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase. Obviously 
hydrophobic 
(oleophilic) substances such as greases, oils, or particles having 
a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle 
than in the aqueous phase. Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable 
amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be 
increased as much as approximately two-fold. Although the matter has 
not been unequivocally demonstrated, the available data show that micelles 
in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process.

Related to micelle formation is the technologically important 
ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil-water interfaces 
in such a manner that the polar (or ionized) end of the molecule is directed 
towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the 
oily phase. In the cleaning process, sorbed greasy soils become coated 
in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant. Then during washing, 
the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets 
can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass, with the aid of 
mechanical action, and enter the aqueous phase. Obviously, a substance 
which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of 
the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off 
the greasy soil.   Substances other than detergent actives also 
tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other 
contiguous condensed phases. This is particularly true of highly charged 
ions, especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes. 
Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly 
sorbed at oil-water interfaces, the highly charged ions are most strongly 
sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting 
an ionic structure (see Table 26-2 on p& 1678). Thus, for aqueous 
media, we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic 
or hydrophobic surface-active agent, and of an idealized builder as 
a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.   From the equilibrium 
sorption data which are available, it seems logical to expect 
that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of 
the dirt (especially clay soils) so as to give it a greatly increased 
negative charge. The charged particles then repel each other and are 
also repelled from the charged surface, which almost invariably bears 
a negative charge under washing conditions. The negatively charged dirt 
particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase. This 
hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic 
actives in detergency. It does not consider the kinetic effects 
of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will 
be discussed later (see pp& 1746-1748).   The crude picture of 
the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as: **f 
The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may 
be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale. Freed soil 
must be dispersed and protected against flocculation. Cleaned cloth 
must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil. It is 
evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one 
detergent constituent acting alone are severe.   Upon consideration 
of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing 
process, it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent 
constituents having "synergistic" properties has gained widespread 
acceptance. In the over-all process, it is difficult to assign a 
"pure" role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation; 
and, indeed, there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles 
of the active, builder, antiredeposition agent, etc& than there 
is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making 
up a given commercial organic active. 
##

The thermal exchange of chlorine between **f and liquid **f is 
readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180` and above. The 
photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of 
unity in the liquid phase at 65` using light absorbed only by the **f. 
In the gas phase, with **f of **f and **f of **f, quantum yields 
of the 
order of **f have been observed at 85`. Despite extensive attempts 
to obtain highly pure reagents, serious difficulty was experienced in 
obtaining reproducible rates of reaction. It appears possible to set 
a lower limit of about **f for the activation energy of the abstraction 
of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine 
atom to form **f radical. The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction 
appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light 
intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at 
the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular 
radical combination reactions. 

#INTRODUCTION#

Because of the simplicity 
of the molecules, isotopic exchange reactions between elemental 
halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer 
particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic 
kinetic data. It would appear that it should be possible to determine 
unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both 
the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies 
of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals, 
as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen 
bond. The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed 
particularly suited for such studies. It should be possible to prepare 
very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum 
system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid. It should be 
possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by 
the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to 
addition of radioactive chlorine. Furthermore, the exchange would not 
be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it 
would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for 
abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be 
too high; also it would be expected that **f would compete very effectively 
with any impurities as a scavenger for **f radicals. Contrary 
to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree 
of reproducibility one would wish, even with extensive efforts to prepare 
especially pure reagents. We are reporting these investigations 
here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently 
simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results 
furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of 
chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride. 

#EXPERIMENTAL#

_REAGENTS._- 
Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a 
tube of resublimed **f into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed 
with liquid air. It was then distilled at least three times 
from a trap at -78` to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction 
being retained in each distillation. The purified product was 
stored at -78` in a tube equipped with a break seal.   Of several 
methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine, the exchange 
of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature 
was found to be the most satisfactory. To prepare the latter, 
silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing **f obtained 
from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The silver chloride was 
fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant 
product of **f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line. 
Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange 
was allowed to take place. The radiochlorine was stored at -78` 
in a tube equipped with a break seal.   Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt, 
low sulfur, reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated 
with **f and **f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt 
tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches. The mixture was then extracted 
with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride 
was distilled on a Vigreux column, a 25% center cut being retained 
which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of **f. Purified 
inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described 
above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with 
a break seal. This chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated 
for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum 
system and the excess chlorine distilled off. The required amount of 
carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on 
a manifold on a vacuum line. The desired amounts of inactive chlorine 
and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on 
the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold 
as a whole was sealed off. The contents of the manifold for liquid phase 
experiments were then mixed by shaking, redistributed to the reaction 
tubes, frozen down, and each tube was then sealed off. The reactants 
for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm 
attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold 
of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off. This method 
in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations 
of reactants in each of the six cells from a set. _REACTION CONDITIONS 
AND ANALYSIS._- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction 
studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm& i&d& and 
about 15 cm& long. In a few experiments the tubes were made from 
standard 6 mm& i&d& Pyrex tubing of 1 mm& wall thickness. Both 
types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres 
exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220`. The photochemical reaction 
cells consisted of 10 mm& i&d& Pyrex tubing, 5.5 cm& 
long, diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed 
through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces. 
These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because 
of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon 
tetrachloride. The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the 
light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window. 
Two types of light source were used, a thousand watt projection 
lamp and an ~AH6 high pressure mercury arc. The light was filtered 
by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that 
only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride 
could enter the reaction cell. Relative incident light intensities 
were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system. Changes of intensity 
on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying 
the distance of the light source from the cell.   Following reaction 
the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous 
sodium iodide solution. Carrier **f was added and the aqueous and 
organic phases were separated (cells containing gaseous reactants were 
immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide). After 
titration of the liberated **f with **f, aliquots of the aqueous and 
of the organic 
phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube. In the liquid 
phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was 
determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments 
after emptying. The fraction of exchange was determined as the 
ratio of the counts/minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the 
counts/minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for 
equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon 
tetrachloride, empirically determined correction being made for the 
difference in counting efficiency of **f in **f and **f. 

#RESULTS# 

_THE THERMAL REACTION._- In studying the liquid phase thermal 
reaction, some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared 
and analyzed. Experiments were done at 180, 200, 210, 220`. Following 
observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly 
identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and 
exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per 
cent&, a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether 
the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine, 
to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface 
to volume ratio in the reaction tubes. In addition to the method 
described in the section above, chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared 
by the electrolysis of a **f eutectic on the vacuum line, and by exchange 
of **f with molten **f. Calcium hydride was substituted for **f 
as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride. No correlation between 
these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found.

The reaction rates observed at 200` ranged from **f of the chlorine 
exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour. In most cases the 
chlorine 
concentration was about **f. Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of 
an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another, 
both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine 
exchanged per hour. No detectable reaction was found at room temperature 
for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours. _THE LIQUID 
PHASE PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTION._- The liquid phase photochemical 
exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible 
than the thermal exchange, although still erratic. The improvement 
was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells 
prepared as a group on the same manifold. Rather large differences were 
still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings. 
Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in 
the temperature range from 40 to 85` in a further endeavor to determine 
the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on 
the activation energy and the effect of light intensity. In all cases 
there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of 
illumination. By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold 
temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging 
from 11 to 18 **f was observed while dependence on the first power of 
the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases.   It 
was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent 
of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated 
for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions 
based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl 
oxalate and of chlorine, and considering the spectral distribution of 
the light source. These estimates indicated that the quantum yield 
for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65` 
is of the order of magnitude of unity.   When typical reaction 
cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated, 
chlorine and phosgene were produced. Exchange was also observed 
in these cells, which had chlorine present at **f. _THE PHOTOCHEMICAL 
EXCHANGE IN THE GAS PHASE._- Although there was some variation 
in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or 
to variation in wall effects, the photochemical exchange in the gas phase 
was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare 
the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose 
of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration 
and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate. Data 
on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity 
are given in Table /1.,   In series /1, the relative light 
intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the 
reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm&. The last column 
shows the rate of exchange that would have been oserved at a relative 
intensity of 4 (14.7 cm& distance) calculated on the assumptions that 
the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square 
of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly 
proportional to the incident light intensity. Direct proportionality 
of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining 
the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2, 
where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen. 
The Poynting-Robertson effect (Robertson, 1937; Wyatt and Whipple, 
1950), which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles 
by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging 
solar radiation, causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much 
shorter than the age of the Earth. The radial velocity varies inversely 
as the particle size- a 1000-~|m-diameter particle near the 
orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years. Whipple 
(1955) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation 
pressure, which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag. 
Further, the corpuscular radiation, <i&e&>, the solar-wind protons, 
must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow 
diminution in size, with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson 
effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational 
force.   The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major 
axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis, 
with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move 
toward the sun. Also, planetary gravitational attraction increases 
the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is 
approached. At one astronomical unit from the sun (the Earth's distance) 
the dust orbits are probably nearly circular. If such is the case, 
the particles within a distance of about **f ~km of the Earth 
will 
have, relative to the Earth, a kinetic energy less than their potential 
energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth. De 
Jager (1955) has calculated the times required for these particles 
to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson 
effect, which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more 
eccentric 
without changing the semi-major axis. This effect can give rise to 
a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth.   Since there is 
a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the 
radiation effects, there must be a continual replenishment: otherwise, 
micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space. There 
are several possible sources. According to Whipple (1955), cometary 
debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the 
sun, maintaining a fairly steady state. Asteroidal collisions are also 
thought to contribute material. It is also possible that some of 
the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts 
upon the moon. 

#5.3 DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF MICROMETEORITE FLUX# 

One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite 
flux in space. Even in the neighborhood of the Earth, where information 
has been obtained both directly and indirectly, the derived flux 
values vary by at least four orders of magnitude. This large discrepancy 
demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the 
lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved. Beyond a 
few million kilometers from the Earth, but still in the region of the 
Earth's orbit, a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable. 
At greater distances from the sun, the situation is still less 
certain.   There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite 
environment. Direct information has been obtained from rockets 
and satellites equipped with impact sensors. In addition, the size 
distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may 
be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain. From the brightness of 
the ~F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal 
light, an estimate of the particle sizes, concentrations, and spatial 
distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic 
plane. Another important source of evidence only recently receiving 
much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic 
component. The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors 
in remote regions are valuable in this category. The data provide a 
measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth.

The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the 
Earth is 
obtained from piezoelectric sensors (essentially microphones) 
and from wire gages; these instruments are installed on rockets, satellites, 
and space probes. Statistically, the most significant data have 
been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha (Explorer /1,), 
1958 Delta 2 (Sputnik /3,), and 1959 Eta (Vanguard /3,). These 
vehicles, with large sensitive areas, have collected data for long enough 
times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure. 
Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products 
contribute some information.   The impact rate on 1958 Alpha 
for 153 events was **f for particles of mass greater than **f (Dubin, 
1960); this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration 
and an assumed impact velocity of **f. The data show daily and diurnal 
variations. Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred 
between midnight and noon, and from day to day the variation of the rate 
was as much as an order of magnitude. One may conclude that most 
of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams 
which intersect the Earth's orbit.   There have been contradictory 
reports from 1958 Delta 2, and the data quoted here are believed 
to be the more reliable. On May 15, a very large increase occurred 
with **f of mass between **f and **f; for the next two days, 
the impact rate was **f; and for the next nine days, the impact rate 
was less than **f (Nazarova, 1960). The data for the first day indicate 
a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may 
have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux.   Preliminary 
data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of **f for masses 
larger than **f for about 1000 events in a 22-day period (LaGow 
and Alexander, 1960). The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor 
of 4.5. The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations. 
Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and 
that the flux is one fifth as large. If one assumes that the average 
flux did not change between measurements, a mass-distribution curve is 
obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius 
to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius.   Space probes have 
yielded little information. Pioneer /1, recorded a decrease in flux 
with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours. With 
detectors 
sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts, 
the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux 
of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones. 
Being based on so few events, these results are of dubious validity.

The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle 
parameters is very uncertain. Many workers believe that the response 
is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles, a relation 
deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic 
velocities. However, one must expect that vaporization and ejection 
of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear 
relationship. In the United States, most of the sensors are calibrated 
by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces. The 
Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse 
from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder 
being momentum of ejected material from the sensor. This "ejection" 
momentum is linearly related to the particle energy. They quote 
about the same mass threshold as that of the U&S& apparatus, but 
a momentum threshold about 40 times greater. There is a difference 
in the experimental arrangement, in that the U&S& microphones are 
attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments 
are isolated from the skin. The threshold mass is derived from the 
momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of **f 
in the U&S& work and **f in the 
U&S&S&R& work. The threshold 
mass of about **f corresponds to a 10-~|m-diameter sphere of 
density **f. However, the conversion from mass to size is unreliable, 
since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy, loosely bound 
meteorite structure with densities as low as **f. To what extent 
such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown. The velocity 
value used is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction 
of the dust is orbiting about the Earth, only about one third the above-mentioned 
average velocity should be used in deriving the mass. Zodiacal 
light and the <gegenschein> give some evidence for such a dust 
blanket, a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture 
is in circular orbits about the sun, as indicated by the trend of the 
smaller visible meteors. The diurnal variation in the observed flux 
may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the 
incident velocity.   The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood 
of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and 
visual meteor data. A summary of meteorite data, prepared by Whipple 
(1958) on the basis of photographic, visual, and radar evidence, 
is given in Table 5-1. From an estimated mass of 25 ~g for a 
zero-magnitude meteorite, the other masses are derived with the assumption 
of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in 
magnitude. The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres 
of density **f except for the smallest particles, which must have a 
higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of 
solar-radiation pressure. The flux values are for all particles with 
masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the 
numbers of visual meteors. It is assumed that the flux values increase 
by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude, in accordance with the opinion 
that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant. 
The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta. The figures 
in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 
per cent shielding by the Earth; hence, these figures apply immediately 
above the Earth's atmosphere. The unshielded flux is given 
in the last column; these figures constitute the best estimate for the 
flux in interplanetary space near the Earth. Of course, if there 
is a dust blanket around the Earth, the fluxes in interplanetary space 
should be less than the figures given here.   Note that the mass 
scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously 
used; for example, Jacchia (1948) derived a scale of 0.15 ~g for 
a **f, zero-magnitude meteorite. The older scales were based on theoretical 
estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into 
light. The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption 
that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum 
transfer to the trail by the meteorite, permitting the calculation of 
the mass if the velocity is known (Cook and Whipple, 1958). 
A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations 
sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude (Manning and Eshleman, 1959). 
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers 
the range of micrometeorites. The approximate equation is **f, 
where ~<n> 
is the number of **f with electron line-density greater than 
or equal to **f, and ~<q> is proportional to the mass of the meteorite. 
Therefore, ~<n> is inversely proportional to the radius cubed 
and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha 
and 1959 Eta data. At the fifteenth magnitude, **f, and at the twenty-fifth 
magnitude, **f. These extrapolated fluxes are about an order 
of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the 
figures in Whipple's table. The extrapolation may be in error for 
several reasons. The observational data determining the concentration 
distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension 
into the micrometeorite region. The solar-electromagnetic- and 
corpuscular-radiation 
pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect 
increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify 
the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns. Also, 
it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may 
not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites (Best, 1960), 
and the same distribution would not be expected. 

#5.4. INDIRECT INDICATIONS 
OF MICROMETEORITE FLUX#

A measure of the total mass accretion 
of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of 
deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions (Pettersson, 
1960). 
Most meteoritic material, by the time it reaches the Earth's 
surface, has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material 
in its passage through the atmosphere. For all meteorites, the average 
nickel content is about 2.5 per cent. This is much higher than the 
nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis 
for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx. Present data 
indicate an accretion of about **f tons per year over the entire globe, 
or about **f. 

#BIOLOGICAL WARFARE#

Biological warfare is the intentional use of 
living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying 
or reducing the military effectiveness of man. It is the exploitation 
of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific 
research and development, resulting in the production of ~BW 
weapons systems. Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to 
his food crops or domestic animals.   Biological warfare is considered 
to be primarily a strategic weapon. The major reason for this 
is that it has no quick-kill effect. The incubation period of infectious 
disease, plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect, 
render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter. A man 
can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period 
of most infectious diseases. Thus, an enemy would probably use this weapon 
for attack on static population centers such as large cities.

An important operational procedure in ~BW for an enemy would 
be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area. This 
concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of 
particulate biological materials, the pathogenesis of respiratory infections, 
the medical management of such diseases and defense against their 
occurrence.   The biological and physical properties of infectious 
particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen 
years. Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed 
for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols 
of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional 
characteristics. Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative 
sampling and assesment techniques. Much of the older experimental 
work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial 
procedures. The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious 
agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure, 
through natural respiration, to aerosolized organisms.   The 
importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated. 
The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features 
of the upper respiratory tract, such as the turbinates of the nose and 
the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi, are capable of impinging 
out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily 
existence. Very small particles, however, in a size range of 1 to 
4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers 
and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs. This area is highly susceptible 
to infection. The entrance and retention of infectious particles 
in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation. The 
relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated 
in Table 1.   In considering ~BW defense, it must be recognized 
that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for 
an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect. For example, bright sunlight 
is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air. There 
are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne. 
Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a 
cloud to travel along the surface. It will rise during lapse conditions. 
There are, of course, certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle 
when most of these conditions will be met.   Certain other properties 
of small particles, in addition to those already mentioned in 
connection with penetration of the respiratory tract, are noteworthy 
in defense considerations. The smaller the particle the further it will 
travel downwind before settling out. An aerosol of such small particles. 
moreover, diffuses through structures in much the same manner as 
a gas. There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion 
through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens, 
restaurants, food stores, hospitals, etc&. Depending on the organism, 
there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products, i&e&, 
in milk for example. The secondary consequences from this could 
be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for 
defense.   Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles 
can be illustrated by the following field trials:   In the 
first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling 
some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological 
conditions. Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were 
disseminated. This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which 
facilitates its sampling and assessment. Four hundred and fifty pounds 
was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 
miles.   Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial. 
The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles. 
From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 
square miles was covered. These dosages could have been increased 
by increasing the source strength which was small in this case. 
The behavior of a biological aerosol, on a much smaller scale, is illustrated 
by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism. 
An aqueous suspension of the spores of <B& subtilis, var& 
niger>, generally known as <Bacillus globigii>, was aerosolized 
using commercially available nozzles. A satisfactory cloud was produced 
even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in 
producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns. In this 
test, 130 gallons of a suspension, having a count of **f organisms 
per ~ml, or a total of approximately **f spores, was aerosolized. The 
spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval 
vessel, cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze. 
Spraying continued along a two-mile course.   This operation 
was started at 5:00 p&m& and lasted for 29 minutes. There was 
a slight lapse condition, a moderate fog, and 100 per cent relative 
humidity. A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore. These 
were located at the homes of Government employees, in Government 
Offices, buildings and reservations within the trial area. A rough 
attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by 
taking samples from outside the windows on the first, ninth, and fifteenth 
floors of a Government office building.   All samplers were 
operated for a period of two hours except one, which was operated 
for four hours. In this instance, there was a dosage of 562 during the 
first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period, 
a four-fold increase. This suggests that the sampling period, particularly 
at the more distant locations, should have been increased.

As can be seen from Figure 2, an extensive area was covered by this 
aerosol. The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source. 
As can be seen from these dosage isopleths, approximately 100 square 
miles was covered within the area sampled. It is quite likely that 
an even greater area was covered, particularly downwind. The dosages 
in the three levels of the vertical profile were: **f   This was 
not, of course, enough sampling to give a satisfactory description 
of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol.   A number of unique medical 
problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious 
agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal 
of entry. 
Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious 
to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle 
size than by the natural portal. Botulinal toxin, for example, is several 
thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os. 
In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from 
this route of exposure, making diagnosis difficult. In tularemia produced 
by aerosol exposure, one would not expect to find the classical 
ulcer of "rabbit fever" on a finger.   An enemy would obviously 
choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious. Agents 
that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers 
such as those causing ~Q fever, tularemia, brucellosis, glanders, 
coccidioidomycosis, etc&, belong in this category.   An agent 
would 
likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence 
stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements. It 
is, obviously, a proper goal of research to improve on this property. 
In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without 
excessive destruction. Moreover, it should not be so fastidious in 
its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant 
scale improbable.   An aggressor would use an agent against 
which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced 
immunity in a target population. A solid immunity is the one effective 
circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized. 
It must be remembered, however, that there are many agents for which 
there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be 
broken by an appropriate dose of agent.   There is a broad spectrum 
of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose 
might be made. An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism, 
a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality.

It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced 
such as antibiotic resistant strains. Mutants may also be developed 
with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in 
identification. All of these considerations are of critical importance 
in considering defense and medical management.   Biological agents 
are, of course, highly host-specific. They do not destroy physical 
structures as is true of high explosives. This may be of overriding 
importance in considering military objectives.   The question 
of epidemic disease merits some discussion. Only a limited effort has 
been devoted to this problem. Some of those who question the value 
of ~BW have assumed that the <only> potential would be in the establishment 
of epidemics. They then point out that with our present lack 
of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall 
of epidemics, it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated. 
They argue further (and somewhat contradictorily) that our knowledge 
and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control 
such an outbreak of disease. this is why this approach to ~BW 
defense has not been given major attention.   Our major problem 
is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target. This, 
of course, does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose 
agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease. A hypothetical 
example will illustrate this point. Let us assume that it would 
be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent 
of epidemic typhus (<Rickettsia prowazwki>) over City ~A and 
that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom. No epidemic 
was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City 
~A was not lousy. Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus. 
In this case, then, the military objective was accomplished with 
an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial 
attack. This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic. 
On the other hand, a similar attack might have been made on City 
~B whose population was known to be lousy. One might expect some 
spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness 
of the attack.   The major defensive problems are concerned 
with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from 
appropriate disseminating devices. It should be no more difficult 
to deliver such devices than other weapons. The same delivery vehicles- 
whether they be airplanes, submarines or guided missiles- should 
be usable. If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on 
a city, it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent 
over that city.   Biological agents are, moreover, suitable 
for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense. 
A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned. 
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are 
subject to attack. America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses 
processed, precooked and even predigested foods. This is an enormous 
industry that is subject to sabotage. One must include the preparation 
of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products. Huge 
industries are involved also in the production of biological products, 
drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack.

A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation 
and study of blood group antibodies. These include low-temperature 
ethanol (Cohn) fractionation, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and 
column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses. Modifications of 
the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators. 
Abelson and Rawson, using a stepwise elution scheme, fractionated 
whole sera containing ~ABO and ~Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl 
~DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. Speer 
and coworkers, in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole 
sera, used a series of gradients for elution from ~DEAE-cellulose. 
Fahey and Morrison used a single, continuous gradient at constant 
~pH for the fractionation of anti-~A and anti-~B agglutinins 
from preisolated ~|g-globulin samples.   In the 
present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on 
~DEAE-cellulose 
using single gradients similar to those described 
by Sober and Peterson, and certain chemical and serological properties 
of the fractions containing antibodies of the ~ABO and ~Rh 
systems have been described. 

#MATERIALS AND METHODS#

_SAMPLES._ 
Serum samples were obtained from normal group ~A, group ~B 
and group ~O donors. Three of the anti-~Rh sera used were taken 
from recently sensitized individuals. One contained complete antibody 
and had a titer of 1:512 in saline. The second contained incomplete 
antibody and showed titers of 1:256 in albumin and 1:2048 by 
the indirect Coombs test. The third, containing the mixed type of complete 
and incomplete antibodies, had titers of 1:256 in saline, 1:512 
in albumin and 1:1024 by the indirect Coombs test. In addition 
one serum was obtained from a donor (R& E&) who had been sensitized 
6 years previously. This serum exhibited titers of 1:16 in albumin 
and 1:256 by the indirect Coombs test. These antibody titers 
were determined by reaction with homozygous **f red cells. _SEROLOGICAL 
TECHNIQUE._ Anti-~A and anti-~B activities were determined 
in fractions from the sera of group ~A, group ~B or group ~O 
donors by the following tube agglutination methods. One drop of each 
sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group **f or 
group ~B red cells in a small **f test tube. In several instances 
group ~O cells were also used as controls. The red cells were used 
within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline 
before use. The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed 
to stand at room temperature for 1 ~hr. the tubes were then 
centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min and examined macroscopically for 
agglutination. For the albumin method, equal volumes of 30% bovine 
albumin, sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to 
stand at room temperature for 1 ~hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 
~rpm for 1 ~min. All samples were tested by both the saline and 
albumin methods. The activities of fractions of sera containing ~Rh 
antibodies were tested by the saline, albumin and indirect Coombs 
techniques. Homozygous and heterozygous **f cells, **f and homozygous 
and heterozygous **f cells were used to test each sample; however, 
in the 
interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with 
homozygous **f and homozygous **f cells will be presented here. 
The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ~ABO 
samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 ~hr at 37`~C 
before centrifugation. The saline tubes were saved and used 
for 
the indirect Coombs test in the following manner. The cells were washed 
three times with saline, anti-human serum was added, the cells were 
resuspended, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min 
and examined for agglutination. The anti-human sera used were prepared 
by injecting whole human serum into rabbits. Those antisera shown 
by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the "broad spectrum" type were 
selected for used in the present study.   The red cells for the 
~Rh antibody tests were used within 3 days after drawing except 
for the **f cells, which had been glycerolized and stored at -20`~C 
for approximately 1 year. These cells were thawed at 37`~C for 30 
~min and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing 
with descending concentrations of glycerol solutions (20, 18, 10, 8, 4 
and 2%). The cells were then washed three times with saline and resuspended 
to 2% in saline. _CHROMATOGRAPHY._ Blood samples were 
allowed to clot at room temperature for 3 ~hr, centrifuged and the 
serum 
was removed. The serum was measured volumetrically and subsequently 
dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 ~hr against three to four changes, 
approximately 750 ~ml each, of "starting buffer". This 
buffer, ~pH 8.6, was 0.005 ~M in **f and 0.039 ~M in 
tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane 
(Tris). After dialysis the sample was centrifuged 
and the supernatant placed on a **f ~cm column of ~EEAE-cellulose 
equilibrated with starting buffer. The ~DEAE-cellulose, 
containing 0.78 ~mEq of ~N/g, was prepared in our laboratory 
by the method of Peterson and Sober (7) from powdered cellulose, 100-230 
mesh. The small amount of insoluble material which precipitated 
during dialysis was suspended in approximately 5 ~ml of starting buffer, 
centrifuged, resuspended in 2.5 ~ml of isotonic saline and tested 
for antibody activity.   The chromatography was done at 6`~C 
using gradient elution, essentially according to Sober and Peterson. 
The deep concave gradient employed (fig& 2) was obtained with 
a nine-chambered gradient elution device ("Varigrad", reference 
(8)) and has been described elsewhere. the other, a shallow concave 
gradient (Fig& 1), was produced with a so-called "cone-sphere" 
apparatus, the "cone" being a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask 
and the "sphere," a 2-liter round-bottom flask. Each initially contained 
1700 ~ml of buffer; in the sphere was starting buffer and 
in the cone was final buffer, 0.50 ~M in both **f and Tris, ~pH 
4.1.

A flow rate of 72 **f was used and 12 ~ml fractions were collected. 
Approximately 165 fractions were obtained from each column. 
These were read at 280 ~m|m in a Beckman model ~DU spectrophotometer 
and tested for antibody activity as described above. _PAPER 
ELECTROPHORESIS._ For protein identification, fractions from the 
column were concentrated by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5`~C 
or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permitted 
simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic 
saline. During the latter procedure the temperature was maintained 
at 2`~C by surrounding the apparatus with ice. Because negative 
pressure 
dialysis gave better recovery of proteins, permitted detection 
of proteins concentrated from very dilute solutions and was a gentler 
procedure, it was used in all but the earliest experiments.   Paper 
electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco 
model ~R cell using barbital buffer, ~pH 8.6, ionic strength 
0.075, at room temperature on Whatman ~3MM filter paper. Five 
milliamperes/cell were applied for 18 ~hr, after which the strips 
were stained with bromphenol blue and densitometry was carried out using 
a Spinco Analytrol.   When paper electrophoresis was to be 
used for preparation, eight strips of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic 
fraction concentrated by negative pressure dialysis were run/chamber 
under the conditions described above. At the end of the run, 
the strips in the third and sixth positions in each chamber were dried, 
stained for 1 ~hr, washed and dried, while the other strips were 
maintained in a horizontal position at 1`~C. The unstained strips 
were 
then marked, using the stained ones as a guide, and cut transversely 
so as to separate the various protein bands. The strip sections containing 
a given protein were pooled, eluted with 0.5 ~ml of isotonic 
saline, and the eluates were tested for antibody activity. _ULTRACENTRIFUGATION._ 
Fractions from the column which were to be subjected 
to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure 
dialysis and dialyzed for 16 ~hr in the cold against at least 500 
volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, ~pH 7.2, ionic strength 0.154. 
They were then centrifuged at 59,780 ~rpm for 35 to 80 ~min 
at 20`~C in a Spinco model ~E ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration 
of 1.00 to 1.25%. Sedimentation coefficients were computed 
as **f values and relative amounts of the various components were calculated 
from the Schlieren patterns.   For preparative ultracentrifugation, 
fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure 
dialysis to volumes of 1 ~ml or less, transferred to cellulose 
tubes and diluted to 12 ~ml with isotonic saline. Ultracentrifugation 
was then carried out in a Spinco model ~L ultracentrifuge at 
40,000 ~rpm for 125 to 150 ~min, refrigeration being used throughout 
the run. Successive 1-~ml fractions were then drawn off with a 
hypodermic syringe, starting at the top of the tube, and tested for agglutinin 
activity.   Other methods will be described below. 

#EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS#

The insoluble material which precipitated 
during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin 
activity, regardless of the blood group of the donor. With either 
of the gradients described, chromatography on ~DEAE-cellulose 
separated agglutinins of the ~ABO series into at least three regions 
(Figs& 1 and 2): one of extremely low anionic binding capacity, 
one of low anionic binding capacity and one of high anionic binding 
capacity. These have been labeled Regions 1, 2, and 4, respectively, 
in Fig& 1. When the early part of the gradient was flattened, 
either by using the gradient shown in Fig& 2 or by allowing the "cone-sphere" 
gradient to become established more slowly, Region 2 activity 
could sometimes be separated into two areas (donors P& J& 
and R& S&, Fig& 1 and E& M&, Fig& 2). The latter 
procedure gave rise to a small active protein peak (Region 1a) between 
Regions 1 and 2. In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of 
agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected 
(Region 3, Fig& 1). Moreover, after concentration using negative 
pressure dialysis, agglutinin activity could sometimes be detected 
in the region designated 2a (donors P& J&, D& A&, and 
J& F&, Fig& 1).   Not all these regions exhibited equal 
agglutinating activity, as evidenced by titer and the extent of the 
active areas. In all cases, most of the activity lay in the region of 
high anionic binding capacity. This was particularly noticeable in group 
~A and group ~B sera, in which cases activity in Regions 1 
and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally 
could not be detected at all. There appeared to be no difference 
in the distribution of anti-~A and anti-~B activity in group 
~O serum, though in two group ~O donors (J& F& and E& 
M&) only one type of agglutinin was found in the regions of low anionic 
binding capacity (Figs& 1 and 2).   Several samples of 
citrated plasma were fractionated in our laboratory by Method 6 of Cohn 
<et al>&. These fractions were tested for ~ABO agglutinin 
activity, using fractions from group ~AB plasma as a control. 
As expected, most of the activity was found in Fraction **f, with 
slight activity seen in Fraction /4,-1. A sample of Fraction **f 
from group ~O plasma was dissolved in starting buffer, dialyzed against 
this buffer and subjected to chromatography using the gradient shown 
in Fig& 2. Once again, both anti-~A and anti-~B activities 
were found in the insoluble material precipitated during dialysis. 
Similarly, both types of antibodies were found in three regions of the 
chromatographic eluate, having extremely low, low, and high anionic 
binding capacity, respectively (Fig& 3).   Chromatography of 
whole sera revealed that the areas of ~Rh antibody activity were generally 
continuous and wide. The incomplete antibody activity appeared 
in the early part of the chromatogram; the complete, in the latter 
part. The serum containing the mixed type of complete and incomplete 
antibodies showed activity in both regions (Fig& 1). In all cases 
the activity against **f cells was spread over a wider area than that 
with **f cells, regardless of the type of test (saline, albumin, indirect 
Coombs) used for comparison. The insoluble material resulting 
from dialysis against starting buffer always showed strong activity. In 
fact agglutination of **f cells in saline could be produced by the 
insoluble material from sera containing "only" incomplete antibody 
activity. This was later known to be the result of concentrating the 
minute amount of complete antibody found in these sera; when the insoluble 
fraction was suspended in a volume of saline equal to that of 
the original serum sample, no complete antibody activity could be detected.

Apart from the honeybee, practically all bees and bumblebees 
hibernate in a state of torpor. Occasionally, you may come across one 
or two bumblebees in the cold season, when you are turning over sods 
in your garden, but you have to be a really keen observer to see them 
at all. They keep their wings and feet pressed tightly against their 
bodies, and in spite of their often colorful attire you may very well 
mistake them for lumps of dirt. I must add at once that these animals 
are what we call "queens", young females that have mated in the previous 
summer or autumn. It is on them alone that the future of their 
race depends, for all their relatives (mothers, husbands, brothers, 
and unmated sisters) have perished with the arrival of the cold weather. 
Even some of the queens will die before the winter is over, falling 
prey to enemies or disease. The survivors emerge on some nice, sunny 
day in March or April, when the temperature is close to 50` ~F 
and there is not too much wind. Now the thing for us to do is to find 
ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the 
red <Ribes sanguineum> of our Pacific Northwest, or otherwise a 
good sloe tree, or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom, preferably 
one with male or staminate catkins. The blooms of <Ribes> and of 
the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects 
will assemble: honeybees, bumblebees, and other wild bees, and 
also various kinds of flies. It is a happy, buzzing crowd.   Each 
male willow catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers. 
It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin are always 
arranged in pairs, and that each individual flower is nothing but one 
such pair standing on a green, black-tipped little scale. By scrutinizing 
the flowers, one can also notice that the scale bears one or two 
tiny warts. Those are the nectaries or honey glands (Fig& 26, page 
74). The staminate willow catkins, then, provide their visitors with 
both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement, for it provides 
exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread, a combination 
of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed. The 
only exception to this is certain bees that have become parasites. I 
will deal with these later on.   Quite often, honeybees form a 
majority on the willow catkins. As we have already seen in the first 
chapter, bumblebees are bigger, hairier, and much more colorful than honeybees, 
exhibiting various combinations of black, yellow, white and 
orange. Let us not try to key them out at this stage of the game, and 
let us just call them <Bombus>; there must be several dozen species 
in the 
United States alone. If you really insist on knowing their names, 
an excellent book on the North American species is <Bumblebees and 
Their Ways> by O& E& Plath.   If we manage to keep track 
of a <Bombus> queen after she has left her feeding place, we may 
discover the snug little hideout which she has fixed up for herself 
when she woke up from her winter sleep. As befits a queen, a bumblebee 
female is rather choosy and may spend considerable time searching for 
a suitable nesting place. Most species seem to prefer a ready-made 
hollow such as a deserted mouse nest, a bird house, or the hole made 
by a woodpecker; some show a definite liking for making their nest in 
moss. Once she has made up her mind, the queen starts out by constructing, 
in her chosen abode, a small "floor" of dried grass or some 
woolly material. On this, she builds an "egg compartment" or "egg 
cell" which is filled with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture 
called beebread. She also builds one or two waxen cups which she fills 
with honey. Then, a group of eggs is deposited in a cavity in the 
beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed. The queen afterward 
keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen, taking a sip 
from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots. When 
the larvae hatch, they feed on the beebread, although they also receive 
extra honey meals from their mother. She continues to add to the 
pollen supply as needed.   The larvae, kept warm by the queen, 
are full grown in about ten days. Each now makes a tough, papery cocoon 
and pupates. After another two weeks, the first young emerge, four 
to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees, 
collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young 
generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying. The first 
worker bees do not mate or lay eggs; males and mating females do not 
emerge until later in the season. The broods of workers that appear 
later tend to be bigger than the first ones, probably because they are 
better fed. By the middle of the summer, many of the larvae apparently 
receive such a good diet that it is "optimal", and it is then 
that young queens begin to appear. Simultaneously, males or drones are 
produced, mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers, although a 
few may be produced by the queen. The young queens and drones leave the 
nest and mate, and after a short period of freedom, the fertilized 
young 
queens will begin to dig in for the winter. It is an amazing fact that 
in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full 
swing, for instance, in August. The temperature then is still very 
high. At the old nest, the queen will in the early fall cease to lay 
the fertilized eggs that will produce females. As a result, the proportion 
of males (which leave the nest) increases, and eventually the old 
colony will die out completely. The nest itself, the structure that 
in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its 
peak, is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain 
beetles and moths.   Not always, though, does the development of 
a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described. 
Some members of the bee family have become idlers, social parasites 
that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives. Bumblebees 
can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of <Psithyrus>, the 
"cuckoo-bumblebee" as it is called in some European countries. 
Female individuals of <Psithyrus> look deceptively like the workers 
and queens of the bumblebees they victimize. The one sure way to tell 
victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the 
case of the idler, <Psithyrus>, lack the pollen baskets- naturally! 
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest 
of her host. When she succeeds, she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively, 
to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the 
bumblebees seal the egg compartment. The hosts never seem to recognize 
that something is amiss, so that the compartment afterward is sealed 
normally. Thus, the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense 
of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread. Later on, they 
and the mother <Psithyrus> are fed by the <Bombus> workers. 
Worse still, in a number of cases it has been claimed that the <Psithyrus> 
female kills off the <Bombus> queen.   But let us return, 
after this gruesome interlude, to our willow catkins in the spring; 
there are other wild bees that command our attention.   It 
is almost certain that some of these, usually a trifle smaller than the 
honeybees, are andrenas or mining bees. There are about 200 different 
kinds of <Andrena> in Europe alone. One of my favorites is <A& 
armata>, a species very common in England, where it is sometimes 
referred to as the lawn bee. The females like to burrow in the short 
turf of well-kept lawns, where their little mounds of earth often appear 
by the hundreds. Almost equal in size to a honeybee. <A& armata> 
is much more beautiful in color, at least in the female of the species: 
a rich, velvety, rusty red. The males are much duller.

After having mated, an <Andrena> female digs a hole straight down 
into the ground, forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil. 
The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or "cells", 
each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread. The 
development of the <Andrena> larvae is very rapid, so that by the 
end of spring they have already pupated and become adults. But they 
are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout 
the summer, fall, and winter. Their appearance, next spring, coincides 
in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants. 
In the Sacramento valley in California, for instance, it has been observed 
that there was not one day's difference between the emergence 
of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins. This must be 
due to a completely identical response to the weather, in the plant and 
the animal.   After the male and female andrenas have mated, 
the cycle is repeated. Although <Andrena> is gregarious, so that we 
may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together, we must still call 
it a solitary bee. Its life history is much simpler than that of the 
truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life 
cycle of many other species. After all, social life in the group of 
the bees is by no means general, although it certainly is a striking 
feature. On the basis of its life history, we like to think that <Andrena> 
is more primitive than the bumblebees. The way in which it transports 
its pollen is not so perfect, either. It lacks pollen baskets 
and possesses only a large number of long, branched hairs on its legs, 
on which the pollen grains will collect. Still <Andrena> will 
do a reasonably good job, so that an animal with a full pollen load looks 
like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind.

Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees. <Nomia 
melanderi> can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of 
the United States west of the Great Plains, for example, in Utah 
and central Washington. In the United States Department of Agriculture's 
<Yearbook of Agriculture, 1952>, which is devoted entirely 
to insects, George E& Bohart mentions a site in Utah which 
was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females. Often the burrows 
are only an inch or two apart, and the bee cities cover several acres. 
The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of <Andrena>, 
but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer, 
and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage. In most places, 
there are two generations a year, a second brood of adults appearing 
late in the summer.   I must plead guilty to a special sympathy 
for nomias. This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington, 
but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and 
Prosser in July or August, when the bees are in their most active 
period. The name "alkali bee" indicates that one has to look for 
them in rather inhospitable places. Sometimes, although by no means 
always, these are indeed alkaline. The thing is that these bees love 
a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in the ground should 
not be stagnant either. They dislike dense vegetation. Where does 
one find such conditions? The best chance, of course, is offered by 
gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and 
where the air is dry, so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits 
which permit only sparse plant growth. 
Many other (probably nearly all) snakes at maturity are already more 
than half their final length. Laurence M& Klauber put length at maturity 
at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes, and Charles 
C& Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes 
(<Thamnophis>) show that the smallest gravid females are more than 
half as long as the biggest adults. Felix Kopstein states that "when 
the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal 
length", but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception, 
with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity. 
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow 
appreciably after attaining maturity; he was working with species 
of Java, so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect. 
Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable 
difference after maturity, but it is impossible to know whether this 
is due to captive conditions. Additional records of slow growth have 
been omitted.   It is possible to make a few generalizations about 
the six giants themselves. There seems to be a rough correlation 
between the initial and ultimate lengths, starting with the smallest 
(boa constrictor) and ending with the largest (anaconda). Data on the 
former are scanty, but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes 
born at a length greater than that of any of the others, thereby 
lending support to the belief that the anaconda does, indeed, attain 
the greatest length. For four of the six (the anaconda and the amethystine 
python cannot be included for lack of data) there is also a correlation 
between size at maturity and maximum length, the boa constrictor 
being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the 
former stage.   Let us speculate a little on the maximum size 
of the anaconda. If, in a certain part of the range, it starts life 1 
foot longer than do any of the other (relatively large) giants, and reaches 
maturity at, let us guess, 18 inches longer than the others, a 
quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of (nearly) 
40 feet.   When it comes to rate of early growth, the Indian 
python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the 
first two years, more or less. The African rock python, a close second, 
is followed in turn by the reticulate python. There are few data 
on the boa constrictor, those for the anaconda are unconvincing, and 
there is nothing at all on the amethystine python. It seems likely that 
the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have 
been made more carefully and frequently; it responds exceptionally 
well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to 
keep.   I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity 
growth; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches 
rather than feet. Until better records have been kept over longer 
periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions, 
it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions.   It is often 
stated 
that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity, but 
this apparently is an overestimation. The best way to determine the 
correct figure (in captives) is by direct observation of pairs isolated 
from birth, a method that produced surprising results: maturing of 
a male Indian python in less than two years, his mate in less than three; 
data on the boa constrictor about match this.   Another approach 
is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at 
maturity. Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations: 
about three years are required, there being a possible slight 
difference between males and females in the time required. Only the 
amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity 
of data.   The following information on snakes varying greatly 
in size (but all with less than a 10-foot maximum) shows, when considered 
with the foregoing, that there is probably no correlation between 
the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature. Oliver, 
in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States, 
could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition 
to the rattlers, which I shall consider separately. These three 
were much alike: lined snake (<Tropidoclonion>), one year and 
nine months; red-bellied snake (<Storeria>), two years; cottonmouth 
(<Ancistrodon>), two years. Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes 
carefully himself and also summarized what others have found. He 
concluded that in the southern species, which are rapidly growing types, 
females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young 
when they are three. Other herpetologists have ascertained that in 
the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first 
birth until it is four or even five years old, and that the young may 
be born every other year, rather than annually. Carpenter's study 
showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature 
at about the age of two. 

#MAXIMUM LENGTH#

Oversized monsters are 
never brought home either alive or preserved, and field measurements 
are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate 
dimensions. Measurements of skins are of little value; every 
snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching 
presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer.   In 
spite of all the pitfalls, there is a certain amount of agreement on 
some of the giants. The anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment, 
but the reason for this is not clear; the relatively wild conditions 
still found in tropical South America might be responsible.

There are three levels on which to treat the subject. The first is 
the strictly scientific, which demands concrete proof and therefore may 
err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh. This 
approach rejects virtually all field measurements. The next level 
attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced, sensible conclusion; 
field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected, 
and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated. 
The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire. 
The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which 
rejects stories about hoop snakes, about snakes that break themselves 
into many pieces and join up again, or even of ghosts that chase people 
out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove, 
to the scientific mind, the existence of hoop snakes, joint snakes, 
or ghosts.   Oliver has recently used the second-level approach 
with the largest snakes, and has come to these conclusions: the anaconda 
reaches a length of at least 37 feet, the reticulate python 33, 
the African rock python 25, the amethystine python at least 22, the Indian 
python 20, and the boa constrictor 18-1/2.   Bernard Heuvelmans 
also treats of the largest snakes, but on the third level, and 
is chiefly concerned with the anaconda. He reasons that as anacondas 
30 feet long are often found, some might be 38, and occasional "monstrous 
freaks" over 50. He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more. 
His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents 
with prodigious strength, but these seem to be given to complete his 
picture, not to be believed.   Detailed information on record 
lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows. 

#GROWTH 
OF THE SIX GIANTS#

Discussions of the giants one by one will include, 
as far as possible, data on these aspects of growth: size at which 
life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached; time required 
to reach maturity; rate of growth both before and after this crucial 
stage; and maximum length, with confirmation or amplification 
of Oliver's figures. Definite information on the growth of senile 
individuals is lacking. _ANACONDA:_ At birth, this species varies 
considerably in size. A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield 
Zoo, near Chicago, ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 
29 inches. Lawrence E& Griffin gives measurements of nineteen 
young anacondas, presumably members of a brood, from "South America"; 
the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit 
of the Brookfield brood and its average. Raymond L& Ditmars 
had 
two broods that averaged 27 inches. R& R& Mole and F& W& 
Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood 
of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries. William Beebe 
reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces (this snake must have been emaciated) 
for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana. 
In contrast, Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two 
young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches, and four young were born in London 
at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces. 
Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces. A difference 
between subspecies might explain the great range in size.

I have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth. Hans 
Schweizer had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches 
in five years, and J& J& Quelch records a growth of from less 
than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years. It is very unlikely that 
either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate.   In 1948, 
Afranio do Amaral, the noted Brazilian herpetologist, wrote a 
technical paper on the giant snakes. He concluded that the anaconda's 
maximum length is 12 or 13 (perhaps 14) meters, which would approximate 
from 39 to 42 feet (14 meters is slightly less that 46 feet). Thus, 
his estimate lies between Oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet 
and the 50-foot "monstrous freaks" intimated by Heuvelmans.

The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in 
eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon, a petroleum geologist of the Richmond 
Oil Company, and reported in 1944 by Emmett R& Dunn. However, 
as a field measurement, it is open to question. Oliver's 37-1/2 
feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable. 
However, many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer 
a tentative maximum of about 30 feet.   It is possible that especially 
large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to 
a small area. In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic 
of subspecies. _BOA CONSTRICTOR:_ A Colombian female's brood 
of sixteen boa constrictors born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 
20 inches. This birth length seems to be typical. When some thirteen 
records of newly and recently born individuals are collated, little 
or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected. The 
range is from 14 to 25 inches; the former figure is based on a somewhat 
unusual birth of four by a Central American female (see chapter 
on Laying, Brooding, Hatching, and Birth), the latter on a "normal" 
newly born individual. However, as so many of the records are 
not certainly based on newborn snakes, these data must be taken tentatively; 
final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods 
from definite localities.   Alphonse R& Hoge's measurements 
of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the 
female is slightly larger than the male.   I have surprisingly little 
information on the size and age at maturity. Carl Kauffeld has 
written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 
1940. One female, collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua, 
was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from <snout to vent> 
(her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long). The female from Central 
America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long.

What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation 
in rate; unfortunately, no one has kept complete records of one individual, 
whereas many have been made for a very short period of time. 
The results are too varied to allow generalization. 
The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close 
relationship throughout. The pulmonary vein, however, without the limiting 
supportive tissue septa as in type /1,, follows a more direct 
path 
to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship (figs& 8, 
22). Another marked difference is noted here. The pulmonary artery, 
in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole, 
the alveolar duct, and the alveoli, continues on and directly supplies 
the thin pleura (fig& 8). The bronchial artery, except for a 
small number of short branches in the hilum, contributes none of the 
pleural blood supply. It does, as in type /1,, supply the hilar lymph 
nodes, the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary vein, the bronchi, and the 
bronchioles- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary 
artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole. No bronchial artery-pulmonary 
artery anastomoses were noted in this group.   Lung 
type /3, (fig& 3) is to some degree a composite of types /1, 
and /2,. It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed 
secondary lobules; well defined, but haphazardly arranged, interlobular 
septa and a thick, remarkably vascular pleura (fig& 9). The 
most distal airways are similar to those found in type /1,, being 
composed of numerous, apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional, 
poorly developed respiratory bronchioles (figs& 14, 15). In this 
instance, because of incomplete septation, the secondary lobule does 
not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung 
as in type /1,. Air-drifts from one area to another are, therefore, 
conceivable. Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery 
on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other, as in type /1, 
(fig& 24). This relationship, however, is not maintained centrally. 
Here the pulmonary vein, as in type /2,, is noted to draw away from 
the bronchus, and to follow a more direct, independent course to the 
hilum (figs& 23, 24). The bronchial artery in its course and distribution 
differs somewhat from that found in other mammals. As seen in 
types /1, and /2,, it supplies the hilar lymph nodes, vasa vasorum 
to the pulmonary artery and vein, the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles. 
As in type /1,, it provides arterial blood to the interlobular 
septa, and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen (figs& 
9, 10). This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular 
bronchial artery branches. Such a dual derivation was strikingly 
demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling 
would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once. Some 
of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the 
bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches 
following along the pleural surface. With completion of filling, net-like 
anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately 
derived branches. An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries 
present within the substance of the lung was noted. This was accounted 
for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following 
the pulmonary artery. The diameter of this bronchial artery was 
much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum (figs& 16, 23, 24). 
In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that 
of the pulmonary artery. This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma 
where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar 
capillary bed (figs& 17, 18). Also three other direct pathways 
of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted: via the pleura; 
through the interlobular septa; and along the terminal bronchiole (figs& 
14, 17, 18, 19). One bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar 
anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level (fig& 26). 

#DISCUSSION#

It is evident that many marked and striking differences 
exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made. The 
significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence 
of corresponding physiologic differences been determined. However, 
the dynamics of airflow, from morphologic considerations alone, 
may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse. The volume 
and, perhaps, even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood 
flow might be different in the dog than in the horse. Also, interlobular 
air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow; probably occur 
in the horse much as in the human being; and, in contrast are present 
to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where 
lobules are absent (Van Allen and Lindskog, '31). A reason 
for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking 
at present.   Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function 
and, if one is permitted to speculate, potential pathology should 
be included in this statement as well. For example, the marked susceptibility 
of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its 
delicate, long alveolar ducts and short, large bronchioles situated 
within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue 
barriers such as those found in types /1, and /3,. One might also 
wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know 
it in man or the horse. In addition, it would be difficult to imagine 
chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow, considering its marked 
lobular development but, conversely, not difficult to imagine this 
occurring in the horse or the dog.   Anatomically, the horse lung 
appears to be remarkably like that of man, insofar as this can be ascertained 
from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of 
others (Birnbaum, '54) in the human being. The only area in which 
one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar 
distribution of the bronchial arteries. As early as 1858, Le 
Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human 
beings. In 1951, this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz. The opposition 
to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller 
('50). Apparently, however, Miller has relied heavily on the 
anatomy in dogs and cats, and he has been criticized for using pathologic 
human material in his normal study (Loosli, '38). Although Miller 
noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed 
between animals, nowhere in his published works is it found that he 
did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian 
lungs other than in the dog and cat (Miller, '13; '25).

The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial 
artery as found in the horse is not clear. However, this artery is known 
to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal 
airways and supportive tissues of the lung. The alveoli and respiratory 
bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues. Theoretically, they 
are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding 
air (Ghoreyeb and Karsner, '13) or from pulmonary arterial 
blood (Comroe, '58). Therefore, an explanation of this alveolar 
bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased 
amount of supportive tissue, not primarily diffusing in nature, 
in the region of the alveolus. If this be true, the possibility exists 
that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread 
degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized 
emphysema. One would not expect such an event to occur in animals 
possessing lungs of types /1, or /2,.   The presence of normally 
occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first 
noted in 1721 by Ruysch, and thereafter by many others. Nakamura 
('58), Verloop ('48), Marchand, Gilroy and Watson ('50), von 
Hayek ('53), and Tobin ('52) have all claimed their normal but 
relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being. Miller ('50) 
is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint. In criticism of the latter's 
views, his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies 
in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution 
under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored 
particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level. As early as 1913 
Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs 
that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level 
when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein, but that 
increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative 
drop in pulmonary artery pressure. Berry, Brailsford and Daly 
in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this. Our own studies in which 
bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated, 
were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure 
on the pulmonary artery or vein, and then by injecting the pulmonary 
artery and vein afterwards. It is distinctly possible, therefore, 
that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered 
the shunts inoperable and hence, uninjectable. This viewpoint is further 
supported by Verloop's ('48) demonstration of thickened bronchial 
artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting 
as valves. In other words, the anastomoses between the bronchial artery 
and pulmonary artery should be considered as <functional> or <demand> 
shunts.   In addition, little work has been done on a comparative 
basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary 
artery anastomoses. Verloop ('48; '49) found these shunts 
in the human being but was unable to find them in rats. Ellis, Grindlay 
and Edwards ('52) also were unable to find them in rats. Nakamura 
('58) was unable to demonstrate their existence, either by anatomic 
or physiologic methods, in dogs. The possibility that the absence 
or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred. 
Certainly, the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one 
or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that 
species. It is, however, highly suggestive and agrees well with our own 
findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring 
bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species, especially 
the dog.   In conclusion, these findings suggest the need for 
a comparative physiology, pathology, and histology of mammalian lungs. 
In addition, a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized 
pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent. 
Also, for the present, great caution should be exercised in the 
choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to 
be applied to man. This is especially so if the dog, cat or monkey are 
to be used, in view of their marked anatomical differences from man. 
Finally, it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be 
anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently 
known species. 

#SUMMARY#

The main subgross anatomical features 
of the lungs of various mammals are presented. A tabulation of these 
features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross 
types. Type /1, is represented by the cow, sheep, and pig; 
type /2,, by the dog, cat, and monkey; type /3,, by the horse. 
Lobularity is extremely well developed in type /1,; absent in type 
/2,; imperfectly developed in type /3,. The pleura and interlobular 
septa are thick in types /1, and /3,. The pleura is extremely 
thin in type /2, and septa are absent. Arterial supply to the pleura 
in types /1, and /3, is provided by the bronchial artery, and 
in type /2,, by the pulmonary artery. In types /1,, /2, and /3, 
the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common 
with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole. In 
type /3, the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the 
alveolar capillary bed. True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent 
form taken by the distal airways in types /1, and /3,, although 
small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present. 
Well developed respiratory bronchioles, on the other hand, appear 
to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type /2,. In 
type /1, the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus 
and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum. This maybe 
due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present. In 
type /3, this general relationship is maintained peripherally but 
not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path 
to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type /2,.

Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 
2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1. First, the Onset Profile 
spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls. 
In contrast, 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile (excluding 
center 5 for boys and 4 for girls) are bunched and extend over a 
much shorter period, approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for 
girls. The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that 
Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion 
is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence. Second, for 
both sexes, the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more 
in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile. Although 
the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines are based 
are <relatively> larger for those centers which begin to ossify early 
(Table 1), there are considerable differences in this value between 
centers having the closely timed Onsets. Third, the process of calcification 
is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these 
boys than for the girls, a fact which confirms data for other groups of 
children.   The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed 
to serve as norms for children. It is convenient to classify 
a child's onset ages and completion ages as "advanced", "moderate" 
(modal), or "delayed" according to whether the child's 
age equivalent "dots" appeared to the <left> of, <upon>, or 
to the <right> of the appropriate short transverse line. When a dot 
appears close to the end of the transverse line, the "moderate" 
rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot 
with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age. Such classifications 
may be called "somewhat advanced" or "somewhat delayed", 
as the case may be, reserving "moderate" for dots upon or close 
to the mean.   In the lower portion of each Chart, the Skeletal 
Age (Hand) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified. 
There the middle one of the three curves denotes "mean Skeletal Age" 
for the Maturity Series boys and girls. The upper curve denotes 
the mean plus one standard deviation, and the lower curve represents 
the mean minus one standard deviation. Thus, a child's Skeletal 
Age "dots" may be classified as "advanced" when they appear above 
the middle curve, "moderate" when they appear immediately above 
or below the middle curve, and "delayed" when they appear below 
the lower curve.   To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity 
Chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which 
show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level 
of growth centers. First, the upper portion requires series of films 
for every child, consisting of those from Hand, Elbow, Shoulder, Knee, 
and Foot. The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand. 
Second, the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an 
equal number of growth centers from the long, short, and round bones 
of the five regions. The lower portion permits comparison of maturity 
levels of short and round bones predominantly, since only two long bones 
are included in Hand and Wrist as a region. Third, the upper portion 
deals with only two indicators of developmental level, Onset and 
Completion. The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate 
maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset 
and Completion. Fourth, the two indicators are for the most part 
widely separated chronologically, with the extensive age gap occurring 
during childhood for all but one growth center. The lower portion provides 
a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood.   Onsets, 
Completions, and Skeletal Ages (Hand) of boy 34 and girl 2 
may be directly compared and classified, using only those Skeletal Ages 
which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion 
Profile. It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection 
of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small, 
according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for 
centers throughout the body. Accordingly, maturity level ratings by 
means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart, respectively, 
should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent 
upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence. 
It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings, but 
there is substantial agreement. Since a Skeletal Age rating can 
be made at any age during growth, from Elbow, Shoulder, Knee, or Foot 
as well as Hand, it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes 
to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood. 
As stated earlier in the paper, Onsets and Completions- 
particularly the former- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy 
in osseous development, each within a limited age period. Such 
an indicator, or indicators, are needed as means of recognizing specific 
periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress.   It 
was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis 
of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth 
centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 
2. As one approach to doing this, Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed 
from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for 
boy 34 and girl 2. The differences between onset age and completion age 
with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition 
by means of a series of arrows. The data for boy 34 appear 
in Figure 3, and for girl 2 in Figure 4. The numbering system used 
in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth 
centers.   The "dot" on one end of each arrow indicates 
extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the 
corresponding mean age for the growth center. The "tip" of the 
arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion 
age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center. Thus, the 
alignment of the "dots" and "tips", respectively, indicate individual 
variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect 
to the mean values for these boys and girls. The direction in which 
the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was 
changed at Completion from the level at Onset. When the "dot" 
and "tip" coincide, the classification used in this paper is "same 
schedule". The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or 
acceleration at Completion over that at Onset, and the difference 
in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale 
along the base of each figure, or more precisely by referring to the 
original data in the appropriate tables.   The difference between 
the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering 
sequence in Figures 3 and 4. This difference is readily clarified 
by referring to Table 1. For example, arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays 
the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34, whereas the same epiphysis 
for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4. For the boy, 
this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion. 
Thus, the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center's 
ability to "catch up" in ossification is demonstrated. In 
contrast, for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset 
and delayed at Completion. Obviously, the slowing for her may have 
occurred at any point between Onset and Completion. The Skeletal 
Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have 
occurred for her during the prepubescent period. Length of the shaft 
of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation 
values for each center in Table 1.   We have attempted to simplify 
the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of 
each child- more than 1700 values for the entire group- by constructing 
figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 
boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center. 
Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for 
each growth center. Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the 
original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this 
monograph have been included in the Appendix.   The principles 
used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the 
construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix. 
One growth center in a short bone- distal phalanx of the second 
finger- was chosen as an example for discussion here, primarily because 
epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion, the maturity indicator for Completion 
in long and short bones, occurs in this center for girls near the 
menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage. Its Completion 
thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include 
in studies of growth, dietary patterns, and health during adolescence.

The following summary, based on Figures 5 and 6, is an 
example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset 
ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the 
appropriate mean age for each growth center. At the top of Figure 5, 
for example, the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen 
growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and 
standard deviation values in Table 1. The 34 arrows, denoting onset 
age plus completion age deviations, have been arrayed in an Onset 
sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 
34 girls. The growth center depicted here, in the distal phalanx of the 
second finger, is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones. 
The mean onset age was 25.3 months (Table 1), and the average 
Span of the osseous stage was 133 months. The correlation (Table 2) 
between onset age and completion age was +.50, and that between onset 
age and Span was -.10. With due consideration for the limits of precision 
in assessing, expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 
2 years, and the known variations in rate of ossification of these 
children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement, each 
arrow with a "shaft length" of four months or less was selected as 
indicating "same schedule" at Onset and Completion, for this particular 
epiphysis. Accordingly, girls 31, 29, 33, 21, 26, 13, 3, 4, 
14, 32, 24, 25, 34, 23, 6, 15, 22, and 16 may be said to have the "same 
schedule" at Onset and Completion.   It seems clear, from 
the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that 
there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions 
for the 34 girls. Accordingly, if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion 
occurs in this phalanx near menarche, early and late menarches might 
have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification 
for the 18 girls with "same schedule". As an example of the interpretation 
of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft 
length in conjunction with its position in the figure: girl 2 had 
a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion. It is of interest 
that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls 
in this group.   A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys 
would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value 
of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage. 
Boys 32, 23, 31, 17, 30, 19, and 24 had "same schedule" at Onset 
and Completion; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage 
would appear possible for only seven boys. Boy 34, like girl 2, did not 
have "same schedule"; his arrow crosses the line denoting the 
mean. The "dot" on his arrow indicates early Onset and the "tip" 
indicates relatively later Completion.   After the 42 figures 
had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6, classifications of the onset 
ages and completion ages were summarized from them. 
Interestingly enough, the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited 
by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and 
is enhanced by the absence of potassium (Wolff, 1960). _B. ORGANIFICATION 
OF IODINE_ The precise mechanism for organification of iodine 
in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood. However, the formation 
of organically bound iodine, mainly mono-iodotyrosine, can be 
accomplished in cell-free systems. In the absence of additions to the 
homogenate, the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein (Fawcett 
and Kirkwood, 1953; Taurog, Potter and Chaikoff, 1955; 
Taurog, Potter, Tong, and Chaikoff, 1956; Serif and Kirkwood, 
1958; De Groot and Carvalho, 1960). This iodoprotein does not 
appear 
to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid, and there 
is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro 
by cell-free systems. In addition, the iodoamino acid formed in largest 
quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine. If tyrosine 
and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate 
of the thyroid, large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can 
be formed (Alexander, 1959). It is not clear whether this system 
bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism, and a system 
generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue. On chemical 
grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to 
**f and then to **f as the active iodinating species. In the thyroid 
gland it appears that proteins (chiefly thyroglobulin) are iodinated 
and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated. Iodination of 
tyrosine, however, is not enough for the synthesis of hormone. The mono- 
and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and 
thyroxine. The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail 
with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain 
di-iodotyrosine analogues (Pitt-Rivers and James, 1958). There 
is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is 
under enzymatic control.   The chemical nature of the iodocompounds 
is discussed below (pp& 76 et seq&). _C. THYROGLOBULIN SYNTHESIS_ 
Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of 
thyroglobulin. Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems, 
nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in 
vitro been unequivocally proven. There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin 
synthesis may proceed independently of iodination, for in 
certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially 
no iodinated thyroglobulin, a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin 
has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments (Wolff, Robbins 
and Rall, 1959). Similar findings have been noted in a patient with 
congenital absence of the organification enzymes, whose thyroid tissue 
could only concentrate iodide. In addition, depending on availability 
of dietary iodine, thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of 
iodine. _D. SECRETION_ Since the circulating thyroid hormones are 
the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine (cf& Section C), 
it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their 
release from proteins before secretion. The presence of several proteases 
and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid. One of 
the proteases has ~pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 
(McQuillan, Stanley and Trikojus, 1954; Alpers, Robbins and Rall, 
1955). The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases 
is increased in thyroid glands from ~TSH-treated animals suggests 
that this protease may be active in vivo. There is no conclusive 
evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly 
purified form nor is their specificity known. A study of their activity 
on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released 
and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation 
of macromolecular intermediates (Alpers, Petermann and Rall, 1956). 
Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes. 
A microsomal de-iodinase with a ~pH optimum of around 8, and requiring 
reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity, has been 
identified in the thyroid (Stanbury, 1957). This de-iodinating enzyme 
is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine, but does not de-iodinate 
thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine. It is assumed that the iodine released 
from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid, 
where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin. The thyroxine 
and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping 
de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream. It has been 
shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine, but the binding does not appear 
to be particularly strong. It has been suggested that the plasma 
thyroxine-binding proteins, which have an extremely high affinity for 
thyroxine, compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine (Ingbar and Freinkel, 
1957). _E. ANTITHYROID DRUGS_ Antithyroid drugs are of two 
general types. One type has a small univalent anion of the 
thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoroboride 
type. This ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis 
by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid. It does 
not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such. The other 
group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil. These 
drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism, but they 
inhibit organification. The mechanism of action of these drugs has not 
been completely worked out, but certain of them appear to act by reducing 
the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin 
(Astwood, 1954). On the other hand, there are a few antithyroid drugs 
of this same general type, such as resorcinol, possessing no reducing 
activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular 
iodine. Any of the antithyroid drugs, of either type, if given 
in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre, owing 
to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, with production of hypothyroidism. 
The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased 
output of ~TSH, causing the thyroid to enlarge. The effect 
of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted 
by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet. 
The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type, however, are not antagonised 
by such means. Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol 
types, certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring 
foods. The most conclusively identified is L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone, 
which was isolated from rutabaga (Greer, 1950). It is presumed 
to occur in other members of the Brassica family. There is some 
evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development 
of goitre, particularly in Tasmania and Australia (Clements 
and Wishart, 1956). There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by 
dairy 
animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active 
goitrogen, which is then secreted in the milk. _F. DIETARY INFLUENCES_ 
Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet, the level of 
iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity 
of the thyroid gland. In the experimental animal and in man gross 
deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia, hypertrophy and 
increased thyroid activity (Money, Rall and Rawson, 1952; Stanbury, 
Brownell, Riggs, Perinetti, Itoiz, and Del Castillo, 1954). 
In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary 
to prevent development of goitre is about 100 ~|mg per day. With 
lower levels, thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow 
enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake 
of iodine. Further, the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction 
of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally. In the presence of 
a low iodine intake, thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with **f is found 
to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal, the amounts of di-iodotyrosine 
and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced. This appears 
to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more 
rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin. If the deficiency 
persists long enough, it is reasonable to suppose that the **f label 
will reflect the **f distribution in the thyroglobulin. Similar results 
might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions 
that limit iodide trapping, or organification, or accelerate thyroglobulin 
proteolysis. 

#B. THE THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE#

The 
name thyroid-stimulating hormone (~TSH) has been given to a substance 
found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so 
far 
tested for its presence. The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin 
or thyrotrophic hormone. At the present time we do not know by what 
biochemical mechanism ~TSH acts on the thyroid, but for bio-assay 
of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity 
may be estimated, including release of iodine from the thyroid, increase 
in thyroid weight, increase in mean height of the follicular cells 
and increase in the thyroidal uptake of **f. Here we shall restrict 
discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise 
for determining the concentration of ~TSH in blood. Brown 
(1959) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying ~TSH, 
and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on 
the subject. 

#1. CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PITUITARY 
~TSH#

As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce (1851) 
that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid.. 
This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith (1922), who showed 
that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate 
the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles. The first attempts 
to isolate ~TSH came a decade later, when Janssen and Loeser 
(1931) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble ~TSH 
from insoluble impurities. After their work other investigators applied 
salt-fractionation techniques to the problem, as well as fractionation 
with organic solvents, such as acetone. Albert (1949) has concluded 
that the most active preparations of ~TSH made during this period, 
from 1931 to 1945, were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent 
as the starting material. Much of this work has been reviewed by 
White (1944) and by Albert (1949). Developments up to about 1957 have 
been discussed by Sonenberg (1958).   In the last few years, 
the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the 
problem of isolating ~TSH has led to further purification (Bates 
and Condliffe, 1960; Pierce, Carsten and Wynston, 1960). The most 
active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators 
appear to be similar in potency, composition and physical properties.

Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in 
blood. First, is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that 
found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored? Second, what 
is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances 
will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction? 
It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary 
~TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood 
~TSH is to be discussed rationally. The importance of knowing in 
what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent 
observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting ~TSH in 
blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients (Adams, 1958). Whether this 
abnormal ~TSH differs chemically from pituitary ~TSH, or 
is, alternatively, normal ~TSH with its period of effectiveness 
modified 
by some other blood constituent, cannot be decided without chemical 
study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison 
of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary 
~TSH.   In evaluating data on the concentration of ~TSH 
in blood, one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used 
to obtain them. The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia 
reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the 
~USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have 
made it possible to compare results published by different investigators 
since that time. We should like to re-emphasise the importance of 
stating results solely in terms of international units of ~TSH activity 
and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units. For 
the most part, this discussion will be confined to results obtained since 
the introduction of the reference standard. _A. STANDARD PREPARATIONS 
AND UNITS OF THYROID-STIMULATING ACTIVITY_ The international 
unit 
(u&), adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different 
laboratories (Mussett and Perry, 1955), has been defined as the 
amount of activity present in 13.5 ~mg of the International Standard 
Preparation. The international unit is equipotent with the ~USP 
unit adopted in 1952, which was defined as the amount of activity 
present in 20 ~mg of the ~USP reference substance. 

#INTRODUCTION#

Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though 
serious complication of steroid therapy, with most of the synthetic 
adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use. Although biopsies have 
shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced 
weakness, this case provides the only example known to us in which 
necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle 
groups. The case described in this paper is that of an older man 
who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of 
steroids for a refractory anemia. 

#REPORT OF CASE#

This patient 
was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital 
for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26, 1959, because 
of disabling weakness and general debility.   In 1953 the patient 
developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were 
given over a period of 4 years. Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956, 
and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed "scattered foci 
of fibrosis" suggestive of myelofibrosis. No additional transfusions 
were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July, 1957, 
in an initial dose of 40 mg& daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg& 
daily. This medication was continued until February, 1958.   In 
February, 1958, the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated 
by pulmonary edema. Additional findings at this time included 
cardiomegaly, peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans, and cholelithiasis. 
The hemoglobin was 11.6 gm&. Therapy included digitalization and 
anticoagulation. Later, chlorothiazide and salt restriction became 
necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure. 
Because of increasing anemia, triamcinolone, 8 mg& daily, was started 
on Feb& 23, 1958, and was continued until july, 1958. In september, 
1958, the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which 
was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia; the hemoglobin was 
10.6 gm&. In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating 
the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component, triamcinolone, 
16 mg& daily, was begun on Sept& 26, 1958, and continued until 
Feb& 18, 1959. At first the patient felt stronger, and the hemoglobin 
rose to 13.8 gm&, but on Oct& 20, 1958, he complained of "caving 
in" in his knees. By Nov& 8, 1958, weakness, specifically 
involving the pelvic and thigh musculature, was pronounced, and a common 
complaint was "difficulty in stepping up on to curbs". Prednisone, 
30 mg& daily, was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov& 
22 until Dec& 1, 1958, without any improvement in the weakness. Serum 
potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq& per liter, and the hemoglobin 
was 13.9 gm& By Dec& 1, 1958, the weakness in the pelvic and 
quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse, and it became difficult 
for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position. 
Triamcinolone, 16 mg& daily, was resumed and maintained until Feb& 
18, 1959. Chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2-week period, but there 
was no change in the muscle weakness.   At this time a detailed 
neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was 
moderate in the hands and feet, but marked in the shoulders, hips, and 
pelvic girdle, with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes. No fasciculations 
or sensory defects were found. Electromyography revealed no evidence 
of lower motor neuron disease. Thyroid function tests yielded normal 
results. The protein-bound iodine was 6.6|mg& %, and the radioactive 
iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was 46% in 24 hours, 
with a conversion ratio of 12%. A Schilling test demonstrated normal 
absorption of vitamin **f. In February, 1959, during the second 
admission to The New York Hospital, a biopsy specimen of the left 
gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei 
and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections. Serial serum potassium 
levels remained normal; the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 
was 10 units per ml& per min&. The clinical impression at this 
time was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis.   On Feb& 
12, 1959, purified corticotropin (~ACTH Gel), 20 units daily 
intramuscularly, was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later 
because of excessive fluid retention. From March 3 to May 1, 1949, 
the patient was maintained on dexamethasone, 3 to 6 mg& daily. In 
May 1959, prednisone, 30 mg& daily, replaced the dexamethasone. Muscle 
weakness did not improve, and the patient needed first a cane, then 
crutches. In spite of normal thyroid function tests, a trial of propylthiouracil, 
400 mg& daily for one week, was given but served only 
to intensify muscle weakness. Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids 
entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted, 
as well as fever, malaise, anorexia, anxiety, and an exacerbation of 
the anemia. These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations 
of hypoadrenocorticism.   Severe back pain in June, 1959, prompted 
a third hospital admission. Extensive osteoporosis with partial 
collapse of ~D8 was found. A high-protein diet, calcium lactate supplements, 
and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint 
or the severe muscle weakness.   The terminal hospital admission 
on June 27, 1959, was necessitated by continued weakness and debility 
complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids. 
X-ray films of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization. 
On July 4, 1959, the patient developed marked abdominal 
pain and distension, went into shock, and died. 

#FINDINGS AT NECROPSY# 

The body was that of a well-developed, somewhat debilitated white 
man weighing 108 lb& There were bilateral pterygia and arcus senilis, 
and the mouth was edentulous.   The heart weighed 510 gm&, 
and at the outflow tracts the left and right ventricles measured 19 
and 3 mm&, respectively. The coronary arteries were sclerotic and 
diffusely narrowed throughout their courses, and the right coronary artery 
was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm& distal 
to its origin. The myocardium of the posterior base of the left 
ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm& area. The 
valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface 
of the mitral leaflets. Microscopically, sections from the posterior 
base of the left ventricle of the heart showed several large areas 
of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue. In addition, other sections 
contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated 
with neutrophils. Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied 
and had large, irregular, basophilic nuclei. The intima of the 
larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue containing 
fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells.   The intimal surface of 
the aorta was covered with confluent, yellow-brown, hard, friable plaques 
along its entire course, and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices 
of the large major visceral arteries. In particular, the orifices 
of the right renal and celiac arteries were virtually occluded, and 
both calcified common iliac arteries were completely occluded.

The lungs weighed together 950 gm&. On the surfaces of both lungs 
there were emphysematous blebs measuring up to 3 cm& in diameter. 
The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung, 
and there were several firm, gray, fibrocalcific nodules measuring as 
large as 3 mm&. Microscopically, there was emphysema, fibrosis, and 
vascular congestion. Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen 
in some of the alveoli, and the intima of some of the small arteries was 
thickened by fibrous tissue.   The firm red spleen weighed 410 
gm&, and its surface was mottled by discrete, small patches of white 
material. The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent, 
and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin. Some of the sinusoids 
contained large numbers of nucleated red cells, and cells of the 
granulocytic series were found in small numbers. There were slight 
fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis.   The liver weighed 2,090 
gm&, was brown in color, and the cut surface was mottled by irregular 
pale areas. Microscopically, there was hyperemia of the central veins, 
and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma. Some liver cord 
cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm, while others had small amounts 
of brown hemosiderin pigment.   The gallbladder contained about 
40 cc& of green-brown bile and 3 smooth, dark-green calculi measuring 
up to 1 cm& in diameter.   The mucosa of the stomach was 
atrophic and irregularly blackened over a 14 cm& area. The small and 
large intestines were filled with gas, and the jejunum was dilated to 
about 2 times its normal circumference. The small intestine and colon 
contained approximately 300 cc& of foul-smelling, sanguineous material, 
and the mucosa throughout was hyperemic and mottled green-brown. 
A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric 
vessels. Microscopically, the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive 
cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods. 
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils. The mucosa 
of the jejunum and ileum showed similar changes, and in some areas the 
submucosa was edematous and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils. 
Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi, and 
there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage. A section of the colon 
revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa, 
associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils. Cultures taken 
from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans, Pseudomonas pyocanea, Aerobacter 
aerogenes, and Streptococcus anhemolyticus.   The kidneys 
were pale and weighed right, 110 gm&, and left, 230 gm&. The 
surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear, fluid-filled 
cysts measuring up to 3 cm& in diameter. On the surface 
of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow, firm, friable raised areas 
measuring up to 2 cm& in diameter. Microscopically, both kidneys 
showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial 
fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and an infiltration of lymphocytes 
and plasma cells. Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed 
with neutrophils. Throughout, there were marked arteriolosclerosis 
and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles. These changes 
were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left. In addition, 
there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney.

The bone of the vertebral bodies, ribs, and sternum was soft and 
was easily compressed. The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and 
showed areas of fatty replacement. Microscopically, there were many 
areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity. 
The cells of the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic series were normal 
except for their numbers. There was no evidence of fibrosis. The 
muscles of the extremities, chest wall, neck, and abdominal wall were 
soft, pale, and atrophic.   Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius, 
pectoralis major, transversus abdominis, biceps brachii, and diaphragm 
showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from 
swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers. 
These changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less 
evident in the pectoralis, diaphragm, and transversus.   In 
the 
gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic 
fibers such as that shown in Figure 2. Such swollen fibers were 
deeply eosinophilic, contained a few pyknotic nuclei, and showed loss 
of cross-striations, obliteration of myofibrils, and prominent vacuolization. 
The necrosis often involved only a portion of the length of 
a given fiber, and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal. 
As shown in Figure 3, the protoplasm of other fibers was pale, granular, 
or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes. Inflammatory cells 
were strikingly absent. In association with these changes in the fibers, 
there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei. These were 
increased both in number and in size, contained prominent nucleoli, 
and were distributed throughout the fiber (Figs& 2-5). In contrast 
to the nuclear changes described above, another change in muscle nuclei 
was seen, usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than 
normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae. 
The nuclei of these fibers, as is shown in Figures 3 and 4, showed remarkable 
proliferation and were closely approximated, forming a chainlike 
structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber. Individual 
nuclei were usually oval to round, though occasionally elongated, 
and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic. At times, clumps of 
10 to 15 closely-packed nuclei were also observed. Occasionally there 
were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained 
many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli (Fig& 5). These 
were thought to represent regenerating fibers. Trichrome stains failed 
to show fibrosis in the involved muscles. In all of the sections 
examined, the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal. 
_PURIFICATION OF THE CONJUGATES_ In attempting to improve specificity 
of staining, the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct 
and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways: (1) They 
were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone 
insoluble powders (Coons, 1958) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy 
sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by <Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens> (E& F& Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover 
stems. 
(2) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed 
for 30 minutes with 20-50 ~mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet 
clover stems. The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of **f in 
**f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80% saturation 
with **f. The precipitate was washed twice with an 80% saturated 
solution of **f, dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 ~<M> neutral 
phosphate buffer, dialyzed against cold distilled water till free 
from ammonium ions, and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen. (3) In other 
experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of 
ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade (1957). (4) The conjugates 
were passed through a diethylaminoethyl (~DEAE-) cellulose 
column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer (~PBS) containing 
**f potassium phosphate and **f. _PREPARATION OF FROZEN SECTIONS_ 
The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that 
described by Coons <et al>& (1951). Root and stem tumors from 
sweet clover plants infected with ~WTV were quick-frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, embedded in ice, and cut at 3-6 ~|m in a cryostat maintained 
at -16` to -20`. The sections were mounted on cold slides 
smeared with Haupts' adhesive (Johansen, 1940) in earlier experiments, 
and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components 
reported by Schramm and Ro^ttger (1959). The latter adhesive 
was found to be much more satisfactory. The sections were then 
thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 
30 minutes; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks. _STAINING 
TECHNIQUE_ _INDIRECT METHOD._ The sections were fixed 
in 
acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37` for 30 minutes. Some of them 
were then covered with a drop of **f in a moist chamber at 24` for 
30-40 minutes. As controls other sections were similarly covered with 
~NS. Sections were then washed with ~PBS for 15-30 minutes. 
After blotting out most of the saline around the sections, a drop 
of **f was layered over each of the sections, allowed to react for 30 
minutes, and then washed with ~PBS for 15-30 minutes. After blotting 
out most of the liquid around the sections, the latter were mounted 
in buffered glycerine (7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of ~PBS). 
_DIRECT METHOD._ After drying the sections under the fan, fixing 
in acetone, and drying at 37` as in the indirect method, the sections 
were treated with conjugated **f or **f (undiluted unless mentioned 
otherwise) for 5-30 minutes. As controls, other sections were similarly 
treated with **f or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of 
potato yellow-dwarf virus (Wolcyrz and Black, 1956). The sections 
were then washed with ~PBS for 15-30 minutes and mounted in buffered 
glycerine. _FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY_ Stained or unstained sections 
were examined under dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence 
microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp (Osram ~HBO 
200). The light beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard 
thickness Corning 1840 filter. In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 ~B 
filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light. A red filter, 
Zeiss barrier filter with the code (Schott) designation ~BG 
23, was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast 
between specific and nonspecific fluorescence. 

#RESULTS#

_SPECIFICITY 
OF STAINING_ _INDIRECT METHOD._ In the first few experiments 
**f was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed 
twice with 50-100 ~mg sweet clover tissue powder. The intermediate 
sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder. Sections of sweet 
clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1:10 solution of **f 
for 30 minutes, washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes, stained with 
**f for 30 minutes, and washed for 15 minutes in ~PBS. Such sections 
showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells 
of the pseudophloem tissue (Lee and Black, 1955). This specific fluorescence 
was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence 
in consecutive sections stained with 1:10 dilution of ~NS 
and **f or with **f alone. Unstained sections mounted in buffered 
glycerine or sections treated only with ~NS or **f did not show 
such green fluorescence. Sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained 
with either **f and **f or ~NS and **f also showed only the light 
green nonspecific fluorescence. However, the nonspecific staining 
by the **f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused 
with the staining of small amounts of ~WTV antigen. 
Two absorptions of **f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of **f (which 
had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride), ~NS and **f with 
crown gall tissue powder, or mouse liver powder did not further improve 
the specificity of staining. Treatment of all the sera with sweet 
clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence, especially when 
the treated conjugate was diluted to 1:2 with 0.85% saline. In 
all the above procedures, when the intermediate sera were diluted to 
1:10 or 1:100 with 0.85% saline, the specific and nonspecific fluorescence 
were not appreciably reduced, whereas, a dilution of the intermediate 
sera to 1:500 or diluting the **f to 1:5 greatly reduced 
specific fluorescence. Rinsing the sections with ~PBS before 
layering 
the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction. In addition 
to other treatments, treating the sections with normal sheep serum 
for half an hour before layering **f did not reduce nonspecific staining.

The only treatment by which nonspecific staining could 
be satisfactorily 
removed was by passing the conjugate through a ~DEAE-cellulose 
column. When 1 ~ml of conjugate was passed through a column 
(**f), the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the 
most 
specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments, and 
very little in others. In the latter cases an additional treatment of 
the ~DEAE-cellulose-treated **f with 50 ~mg of sweet clover stem 
tissue powder further improved the specificity. After these treatments 
the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues 
or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable 
from the bright yellow-green specific staining. With this purified 
conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections 
with 1:10 dilution of **f for 30 minutes, washing with ~PBS 
for 15 minutes, staining with **f for 30 minutes, and washing with 
~PBS for 15 minutes. The specificity of staining in ~WTV tumors 
with **f and **f but not with ~NS and **f or with antiserum to 
potato yellow-dwarf virus and **f, and the absence of such staining 
in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover, indicate that an antigen 
of ~WTV was being stained. _DIRECT METHOD._ **f was first conjugated 
with 50 ~mg of ~FITC per gram of globulin. This conjugate 
was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various 
tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method. 
In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still 
present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence.

In later experiments, **f and **f were prepared by conjugating 
8 ~mg of ~FITC per gram of globulin. These conjugates 
**f had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate (with 
50 ~mg ~FITC per gram of globulin) while the specific staining 
was similar in both cases. Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily 
eliminated by passing these conjugates through a ~DEAE-cellulose 
column as described for **f. The best staining procedure with 
this purified **f consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 
minutes and washing in ~PBS for 15 minutes. The specificity of 
staining with **f was established as follows: **f specifically stained 
tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or 
of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover. Sections of tumors incited 
by ~WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum 
or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus.   After 
passing **f through ~DEAE-cellulose, the titer of antibodies to 
~WTV in the specific fraction was 1:4 of the titer before such 
passage (precipitin ring tests by R& F& Whitcomb); but mere dilution 
of the conjugate to 1:4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific 
staining. This indicates that increase in specificity of **f after 
passing it through ~DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution.

Specific staining by ~DEAE-cellulose treated **f 
and **f, although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either 
nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells, was not satisfactorily 
photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts 
with black and white and color photography. This was chiefly because 
of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells. The autofluorescence 
from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant. 
_DISTRIBUTION OF VIRUS ANTIGEN_ Results of specific staining by the 
direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization 
of ~WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors. The virus antigen 
was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue. Frequently a few isolated 
thick-walled cells or, rarely, groups of such cells in the xylem region, 
were also specifically stained, but there was no such staining 
in epidermis, cortex, most xylem cells, ray cells, or pith.   Within 
the pseudophloem cells the distribution of ~WTV antigen was 
irregular in the cytoplasm. No antigen was detectable in certain dark 
spherical areas in most cells. These areas are thought to represent 
the 
nuclei. In some tumor sections small spherical bodies, possibly inclusion 
bodies (Littau and Black, 1952) stained more intensely than 
the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen. In all cases 
studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not 
contain detectable amounts of ~WTV antigen. 

#DISCUSSION#

In 
both the direct and indirect methods of staining, the conjugates had 
nonspecifically staining fractions. In the indirect method, this was 
evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green 
even when stained with ~NS and **f or with **f only. In the direct 
method, **f, not further treated, stained certain tissues of healthy 
sweet clover stems nonspecifically and ~WTV tumor sections were similarly 
stained by comparable **f. After **f and **f were passed through 
Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover 
tissue powder, nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing 
amount of such staining was still present. Treatment of the conjugates 
with ethyl acetate, and the conjugates (which had been passed 
through Dowex-2-chloride) with mouse liver powder, sweet clover crown 
gall tissue powder, or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily 
remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates. Such 
treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating 
nonspecific staining in several other systems (Coons, 1958). Schramm 
and Ro^ttger (1959) did not report any such nonspecific staining 
of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco 
mosaic virus. The reason for the failure of these treatments to 
eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not 
known.   In our work the best procedure for removing substances 
causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was 
to pass the conjugates through a ~DEAE-cellulose 
column and in some cases to absorb the first and second 
milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder.   The 
specific 
staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that ~WTV antigen 
was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled 
cells in the xylem region, but was not detectable in any other 
tissues of the root and stem tumors. A study of the distribution of ~WTV 
antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly 
distributed in the cytoplasm.   Wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper 
transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation 
(Black, 1944; Brakke <et al>&, 1954). The concentration 
and 
apparent localization of the ~WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue 
of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies 
in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order 
to infect plants.

Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on 
individual experience and are aroused in man, in addition, by complex 
symbols, one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from 
the cortex. In experiments with topical application of strychnine on 
the cerebral cortex, the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the 
hypothalamus was demonstrated. Moreover, the responsiveness of the 
hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these 
conditions. Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms 
of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey ~<A> on seeing 
monkey ~<B> (but not a rabbit) in emotional stress. A previously 
extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey ~<A> 
and was associated 
with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic 
discharges.   It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism 
exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity 
is concerned, and that the balance between the two systems determines 
the emotional responsiveness of the organism. In addition, the 
neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates, as 
Mirsky's interesting experiment on the "communication of affect" 
demonstrates. But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals 
such as the rat, sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus 
and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex. MacLean stressed 
correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of 
the individual and the species, as evidenced by the influence of the 
limbic brain (including the hypothalamus) on emotions related to fight 
and flight and also on sexual functions. It should be added that in 
man 
neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion 
of emotional processes with those underlying perception, memory, 
imagination, and creativity.   Previous experiences are obviously 
of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional 
response. The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute 
to memory, but this topic is beyond the scope of this 
paper. #/13,. HYPOTHALAMIC BALANCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE#

After 
this brief discussion of neo-, paleocortical, and cortico-hypothalamic 
relations, let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance 
and its physiological and pathological significance. Facilitatory 
processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending 
and descending pathways. Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical 
application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate 
with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive 
discharges. On the other hand, the temporary reduction in hypothalamic 
excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior 
hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of 
cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored. 
Apparently, a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus 
and the cerebral cortex. Consequently, if for any reason 
the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level, the 
lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state 
of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal 
discharges. Obviously, a vicious cycle develops. This tendency can 
be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or 
via cortico-hypothalamic pathways. It is believed that drug therapy 
and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism.

Before we comment further on these pathological conditions, 
we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within 
physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Thus, 
a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep 
and a high one during wakefulness, resulting in synchronous ~EEG 
potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition. Moreover, 
the dominance in parasympathetic action (with reciprocal inhibition 
of the sympathetic) at the hypothalamic level induces, by its peripheral 
action, the autonomic symptoms of sleep and, by its action on the 
cortex, a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus 
of the somatic nervous system. With the dominance of the sympathetic 
division of the hypothalamus, the opposite changes occur. Since 
electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects 
of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces 
sleep, it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is 
altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus. 
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes 
in man and animals.   Of particular importance is the study of 
the actions of drugs in this respect. Although no drugs act exclusively 
on the hypothalamus or a part of it, there is sufficient specificity 
to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic 
side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance. The 
former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs, the latter the tranquilizers. 
Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs 
belonging to the same group as, for instance, between reserpine and 
chlorpromazine. Important as these differences are, they should not 
obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently 
to the parasympathetic side, we produce depressions, whereas 
a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and, eventually, 
maniclike changes. The emotional states produced by drugs influence 
the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner; synchrony 
prevails in the ~EEG of the experimental animal after administration 
of tranquilizers, but asynchrony after application of analeptic and 
psychoactive drugs.   The shock therapies act likewise on the 
hypothalamic balance. Physiological experiments and clinical observations 
have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled 
hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges. 
They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side. This explains 
the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions 
and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the 
sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test. Some investigators 
have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic 
reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated 
by the Mecholyl test and, conversely, between clinical impairment and 
increasing deviation of this test from the norm. Nevertheless, the 
theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has 
a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients 
has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients. The 
Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are 
reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance, but for the sake 
of correlating autonomic and clinical states, and of studying the effect 
of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions, 
additional tests seem to be desirable.   It was assumed that the 
shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in 
neuropsychiatric 
patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures 
follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle. 
A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal 
individual to sleep or, in special circumstances, to cardiovascular 
collapse or nausea and vomiting. In both conditions the emotional and 
perceptual sensitivity is diminished, but no depression occurs such 
as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs. The 
fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states 
of parasympathetic (and also of sympathetic) dominance remain to be 
elucidated.   Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies 
in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges 
which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to <qualitative> 
alterations in reactivity. A state of parasympathetic "tuning" 
of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase 
in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and 
reflexly induced stimuli, but leads also to an autonomic reversal: 
a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in 
this state of tuning a parasympathetic response! Furthermore, conditioned 
reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic 
reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level, and several types 
of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic 
"tuning" are observed. If, for instance, such a change is 
produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks, previously 
inhibited conditioned reactions reappear. However, if these procedures 
are applied more often, conditioned emotional responses are temporarily 
abolished. In other studies, loss of differentiation in previously 
established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive (metrazol) 
treatments, suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance 
between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes.   It has 
further been shown that: (1) an experimental neurosis in its initial 
stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic 
balance; (2) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned 
reactions; (3) in a state of depression, the positive conditioned 
stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased 
synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing (alerting) 
effect on the ~EEG. These are few and seemingly disjointed data, 
but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations 
in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic 
balance has been altered by physiological experimentation, 
pharmacological action, or clinical processes. #/14,. ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL 
BASIS OF SOME FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY#

The foregoing remarks 
imply 
that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads 
between physiological and pathological forms of emotion. If this is 
the case, one would expect that not only the various procedures just 
mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional 
state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise. We 
pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders 
and neurotic symptoms, particularly in certain types of personality, 
but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ("abreaction") 
may cure a battle neurosis. This phenomenon raises the question 
whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not 
have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses. Being 
a strictly 
physiological procedure, one may expect from such a study additional 
information on the nature of the emotional process itself.

Wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area. He showed 
convincingly that anxiety is a learned (conditioned) reaction and 
is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed, therefore, 
that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional 
and reversible. An important observation of Pavlov served as a 
guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means. In 
a conditioning experiment, he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding 
and pain. A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus 
and was followed by feeding. The pain became thus the symbol for food 
and elicited salivary secretion (conditioned reflex). Even when the 
intensity of the shocks was increased gradually, it failed to evoke 
any signs of pain. Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental 
neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental 
situation, Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism 
to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding. Appropriate 
experiments showed that this is, indeed, possible. He then applied 
this 
principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses. He took advantage 
of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety 
and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former 
attitude was established.   For the interpretation of these significant 
investigations, it should be remembered that reciprocal relations 
exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions 
which are closely associated with the emotions. The feeding-pain 
antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the 
tropho- and ergotropic systems. Furthermore, a functional antagonism 
exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety. Although 
in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present, different autonomic-somatic 
patterns underlie aggression and anxiety, respectively, 
as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines, the state 
of the muscle tone, and the Mecholyl test. The psychological incompatibility 
of these emotional states seems to be reflected in, or based 
on, this marked difference. #/15,. CONCLUDING REMARKS#

In 
our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological 
range, we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity 
of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system 
and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems, respectively. 
We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with 
respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding 
the hypothalamic-cortical discharge. Although we are still far from 
a complete understanding of these problems, as a first approximation, 
it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent 
changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for 
major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions 
in man and beast under physiological circumstances, in experimental and 
clinical neurosis, and as the result of psychopharmacological agents. 
In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in 
the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism 
observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several 
instances, it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may 
play an important role in initiating mental changes. 

#6.4. THE PRIMARY DECOMPOSITION THEOREM#

We are trying to study a 
linear operator ~<T> on the finite-dimensional space ~<V>, 
by decomposing ~<T> into a direct sum of operators which are in some 
sense elementary. We can do this through the characteristic values 
and vectors of ~<T> in certain special cases, i&e&, when the 
minimal polynomial for ~<T> factors over the scalar field ~<F> 
into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1. What can 
we do with the general ~<T>? If we try to study ~<T> using 
characteristic values, we are confronted with two problems. First, 
~<T> may not have a single characteristic value; this is really 
a deficiency in the scalar field, namely, that it is not algebraically 
closed. Second, even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely 
over ~<F> into a product of polynomials of degree 1, there 
may not be enough characteristic vectors for ~<T> to span the 
space ~<V>; this is clearly a deficiency in ~<T>. The second 
situation is illustrated by the operator ~<T> on **f (~<F> 
any field) represented in the standard basis by **f. The characteristic 
polynomial for ~<A> is **f and this is plainly also the minimal 
polynomial for ~<A> (or for ~<T>). Thus ~<T> is not 
diagonalizable. One sees that this happens because the null space of 
**f has dimension 1 only. On the other hand, the null space of **f and 
the null space of **f together span ~<V>, the former being the 
subspace spanned by **f and the latter the subspace spanned by **f and 
**f.   This will be more or less our general method for the second 
problem. If (remember this is an assumption) the minimal polynomial 
for ~<T> decomposes **f where **f are distinct elements of ~<F>, 
then we shall show that the space ~<V> is the direct sum 
of the null spaces of **f. The diagonalizable operator is the special 
case of this in which **f for each ~<i>. The theorem which we prove 
is more general than what we have described, since it works with the 
primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial, whether or not the primes 
which enter are all of first degree. The reader will find it helpful 
to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1, and 
even more particularly, to think of the proof of Theorem 10, a special 
case of this theorem. 

#THEOREM 12. (PRIMARY DECOMPOSITION THEOREM).# 
<Let> ~T <be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional 
vector space> ~V <over the field> ~F. <Let> ~p <be the 
minimal polynomial for> ~T, **f <where the **f are distinct irreducible 
monic polynomials over> ~F <and the **f are positive integers. 
Let **f be the null space of **f. Then> (a) **f (b) <each **f 
is invariant under> ~T (c) <if **f is the operator induced on 
**f by> ~T, 
<then the minimal polynomial for **f is **f.> _PROOF._ 
The idea of the proof is this. If the direct-sum decomposition 
(a) is valid, how can we get hold of the projections **f associated with 
the decomposition? The projection **f will be the identity on **f 
and zero on the other **f. We shall find a polynomial **f such that 
**f is the identity on **f and is zero on the other **f, and so that 
**f, etc&.   For each ~<i>, let **f. Since **f are distinct 
prime polynomials, the polynomials **f are relatively prime (Theorem 
8, Chapter 4). Thus there are polynomials **f such that **f. Note 
also that if **f, then **f is divisible by the polynomial ~<p>, 
because **f contains each **f as a factor. We shall show that the polynomials 
**f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of 
the proof.   Let **f. Since **f and ~<p> divides **f for **f, 
we have **f. Thus the **f are projections which correspond to some 
direct-sum decomposition of the space ~<V>. We wish to show that 
the range of **f is exactly the subspace **f. It is clear that each 
vector in the range of **f is in **f for if ~|a is in the range of 
**f, then **f and so **f because **f is divisible by the minimal polynomial 
~<p>. Conversely, suppose that ~|a is in the null space 
of **f. If **f, then **f is divisible by **f and so **f, i&e&, 
**f. But then it is immediate that **f, i&e&, that ~|a is in 
the range of **f. This completes the proof of statement (a). 
It is certainly clear that the subspaces **f are invariant under ~<T>. 
If **f is the operator induced on **f by ~<T>, then evidently 
**f, because by definition **f is 0 on the subspace **f. This shows 
that the minimal polynomial for **f divides **f. Conversely, let 
~<g> be any polynomial such that **f. Then **f. Thus **f is divisible 
by the minimal polynomial ~<p> of ~<T>, i&e&, **f 
divides **f. It is easily seen that **f divides ~<g>. Hence the 
minimal polynomial for **f is **f. 

#COROLLARY.#

<If **f are the 
projections associated with the primary decomposition of> ~T, <then 
each **f is a polynomial in> ~T, <and accordingly if a linear 
operator> ~U <commutes with> ~T <then> ~U <commutes with 
each of the **f i&e&, each subspace **f is invariant under> ~U.

In the notation of the proof of Theorem 12, let us take a 
look at the special case in which the minimal polynomial for ~<T> 
is a product of first-degree polynomials, i&e&, the case in 
which 
each **f is of the form **f. Now the range of **f is the null space 
**f of **f. Let us put **f. By Theorem 10, ~<D> is a diagonalizable 
operator which we shall call the {diagonalizable part} 
of ~<T>. 
Let us look at the operator **f. Now **f **f so **f. The reader 
should be familiar enough with projections by now so that he sees that 
**f and in general that **f. When **f for each ~<i>, we shall have 
**f, because the operator **f will then be 0 on the range of **f. 

#DEFINITION.#

<Let> ~N <be a linear operator on the vector 
space> ~V. <We say that> ~N <is> {nilpotent} <if there 
is some positive integer> ~r <such that> **f. 

#THEOREM 13.#

<Let> 
~T <be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector 
space> ~V <over the field> ~F. <Suppose that the minimal polynomial 
for> ~T <decomposes over> ~F <into a product of linear 
polynomials. Then there is a diagonalizable operator> ~D <on> 
~V <and a nilpotent operator> ~N <on> ~V <such that> 
(a) **f, (b) **f. <The diagonalizable operator> ~D <and the nilpotent 
operator> ~N <are uniquely determined by> (a) <and> (b) 
<and 
each of them is a polynomial in> ~T. _PROOF._ We have just observed 
that we can write **f where ~<D> is diagonalizable and ~<N> 
is nilpotent, and where ~<D> and ~<N> not only commute 
but are polynomials in ~<T>. Now suppose that we also have **f 
where ~<D'> is diagonalizable, ~<N'> is nilpotent, and 
**f. We shall prove that **f.   Since ~<D'> and ~<N'> 
commute with one another and **f, we see that ~<D'> and ~<N'> 
commute with ~<T>. Thus ~<D'> and ~<N'> 
commute with any polynomial in ~<T>; hence they commute with ~<D> 
and with ~<N>. Now we have **f or **f and all four of these 
operators commute with one another. Since ~<D> and ~<D'> 
are both diagonalizable and they commute, they are simultaneously 
diagonalizable, and **f is diagonalizable. Since ~<N> and ~<N'> 
are both nilpotent and they commute, the operator **f is nilpotent; 
for, using the fact that ~<N> and ~<N'> commute **f 
and so when ~<r> is sufficiently large every term in this expression 
for **f will be 0. (Actually, a nilpotent operator on an ~<n>-dimensional 
space must have its ~<n>th power 0; if we take **f 
above, that will be large enough. It then follows that **f is large 
enough, but this is not obvious from the above expression.) Now **f is 
a diagonalizable operator which is also nilpotent. Such an operator 
is obviously the zero operator; for since it is nilpotent, the minimal 
polynomial for this operator is of the form **f for some **f; but 
then since the operator is diagonalizable, the minimal polynomial cannot 
have a repeated root; hence **f and the minimal polynomial is simply 
~<x>, which says the operator is 0. Thus we see that **f and 
**f. 

#COROLLARY.#

<Let> ~V <be a finite-dimensional vector 
space over an algebraically closed field> ~F, <e&g&, the field 
of complex numbers. Then every linear operator> ~T <on> ~V 
<can be written as the sum of a diagonalizable operator> ~D <and 
a nilpotent operator> ~N <which commute. These operators> ~D 
<and> ~N <are unique and each is a polynomial in> ~T.

From these results, one sees that the study of linear operators 
on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced 
to the study of nilpotent operators. For vector spaces over non-algebraically 
closed fields, we still need to find some substitute for 
characteristic values and vectors. It is a very interesting fact that 
these two problems can be handled simultaneously and this is what we 
shall do in the next chapter.   In concluding this section, we 
should like to give an example which illustrates some of the ideas of 
the primary decomposition theorem. We have chosen to give it at the 
end of the section since it deals with differential equations and thus 
is not purely linear algebra. 

#EXAMPLE 11.#

In the primary decomposition 
theorem, it is not necessary that the vector space ~<V> 
be finite dimensional, nor is it necessary for parts (a) and (b) that 
~<p> be the 
minimal polynomial for ~<T>. If ~<T> is a linear operator 
on an arbitrary vector space and <if> there is a monic polynomial 
~<p> such that **f, then parts (a) and (b) of Theorem 12 are valid 
for ~<T> with the proof which we gave.   Let ~<n> be 
a positive integer and let ~<V> be the space of all ~<n> times 
continuously differentiable functions ~<f> on the real line which 
satisfy the differential equation **f where **f are some fixed constants. 
If **f denotes the space of ~<n> times continuously differentiable 
functions, then the space ~<V> of solutions of this differential 
equation is a subspace of **f. If ~<D> denotes the differentiation 
operator and ~<p> is the polynomial **f then ~<V> 
is the null space of the operator ~<p(D)>, because **f simply says 
**f. Let us now regard ~<D> as a linear operator on the subspace 
~<V>. Then **f.   If we are discussing differentiable complex-valued 
functions, then **f and ~<V> are complex vector spaces, 
and **f may be any complex numbers. We now write **f where **f are 
distinct complex numbers. If **f is the null space of **f, then Theorem 
12 says that **f. In other words, if ~<f> satisfies the differential 
equation **f, then ~<f> is uniquely expressible in the 
form **f where **f satisfies the differential equation **f. Thus, the 
study of the solutions to the equation **f is reduced to the study of 
the space of solutions of a differential equation of the form **f. This 
reduction has been accomplished by the general methods of linear algebra, 
i&e&, 
by the primary decomposition theorem.   To describe 
the space of solutions to **f, one must know something about differential 
equations, that is, one must know something about ~<D> other 
than the fact that it is a linear operator. However, one does not 
need to know very much. It is very easy to establish by induction on 
~<r> that if ~<f> is in **f then **f that is, **f, etc&. Thus 
**f if and only if **f. A function ~<g> such that **f, i&e&, 
**f, must be a polynomial function of degree **f or less: **f. 
Thus ~<f> satisfies **f if and only if ~<f> has the form **f. 
Accordingly, the 'functions' **f span the space of solutions of 
**f. Since **f are linearly independent functions and the exponential 
function has no zeros, these ~<r> functions **f, form a basis for 
the space of solutions. 

#7-1. EXAMPLES OF BINOMIAL EXPERIMENTS#

Some experiments are composed 
of repetitions of independent trials, each with <two> possible 
outcomes. The binomial probability distribution may describe the variation 
that occurs from one set of trials of such a <binomial> experiment 
to another. We devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not 
only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real 
life phenomena, but also because it has important properties that recur 
in many other probability models. We begin with a few examples of 
binomial experiments. _MARKSMANSHIP EXAMPLE._ A trained marksman 
shooting five rounds at a target, all under practically the same conditions, 
may hit the bull's-eye from 0 to 5 times. In repeated sets of 
five shots his numbers of bull's-eyes vary. What can we say of the 
probabilities of the different possible numbers of bull's-eyes? 
_INHERITANCE IN MICE._ In litters of eight mice from similar parents, 
the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer 
from 0 to 8. What probabilities should be attached to these possible 
outcomes? _ACES (ONES) WITH THREE DICE._ When three dice are 
tossed repeatedly, what is the probability that the number of aces is 
0 (or 1, or 2, or 3)? _GENERAL BINOMIAL PROBLEM._ More generally, 
suppose that an experiment consists of a number of independent trials, 
that each trial results in either a "success" or a "non-success" 
("failure"), and that the probability of success remains constant 
from trial to trial. In the examples above, the occurrence of 
a bull's-eye, 
a straight-haired mouse, or an ace could be called a "success". 
In general, any outcome we choose may be labeled "success".

The major question in this chapter is: What is the probability 
of exactly ~<x> successes in ~<n> trials?   In 
Chapters 3 and 4 we answered questions like those in the examples, 
usually by counting points in a sample space. Fortunately, a general 
formula of wide applicability solves all problems of this kind. Before 
deriving this formula, we explain what we mean by "problems of this 
kind".   Experiments are often composed of several identical 
trials, and sometimes experiments themselves are repeated. In the marksmanship 
example, a trial consists of "one round shot at a target" 
with outcome either one bull's-eye (success) or none (failure). 
Further, an experiment might consist of five rounds, and several sets 
of five rounds might be regarded as a super-experiment composed of several 
repetitions of the five-round experiment. If three dice are tossed, 
a trial is one toss of one die and the experiment is composed of 
three trials. Or, what amounts to the same thing, if one die is tossed 
three times, each toss is a trial, and the three tosses form the experiment. 
Mathematically, we shall not distinguish the experiment of 
three dice tossed once from that of one die tossed three times. These 
examples are illustrative of the use of the words "trial" and "experiment" 
as they are used in this chapter, but they are quite flexible 
words and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly. _EXAMPLE 
1. STUDENT FOOTBALL MANAGERS._ Ten students act as managers for 
a high-school football team, and of these managers a proportion ~<p> 
are licensed drivers. Each Friday one manager is chosen by lot to 
stay late and load the equipment on a truck. On three Fridays the coach 
has needed a driver. Considering only these Fridays, what is the 
probability that the coach had drivers all 3 times? Exactly 2 times? 
1 time? 0 time? _DISCUSSION._ Note that there are 3 trials 
of interest. Each trial consists of choosing a student manager at 
random. The 2 possible outcomes on each trial are "driver" or "nondriver". 
Since the choice is by lot each week, the outcomes of 
different trials are independent. The managers stay the same, so that 
**f is the same for all weeks. We now generalize these ideas for general 
binomial experiments.   For an experiment to qualify as a 
<binomial experiment>, it must have four properties: (1) there must 
be a fixed number of trials, (2) each trial must result in a "success" 
or a "failure" (a binomial trial), (3) all trials must have 
identical probabilities of success, (4) the trials must be independent 
of each other. Below we use our earlier examples to describe and illustrate 
these four properties. We also give, for each property, an example 
where the property is absent. The language and notation introduced 
are standard throughout the chapter. _1. THERE MUST BE A FIXED 
NUMBER ~N OF REPEATED TRIALS._ For the marksman, we study sets 
of five shots (**f); for the mice, we restrict attention to litters 
of eight (**f); and for the aces, we toss three dice (**f). _EXPERIMENT 
WITHOUT A FIXED NUMBER OF TRIALS._ Toss a die until an ace appears. 
Here the number of trials is a random variable, not a fixed number. 
_2. BINOMIAL TRIALS._ Each of the ~<n> trials is either a success 
or a failure. "Success" and "failure" are just convenient 
labels for the two categories of outcomes when we talk about binomial 
trials in general. These words are more expressive than labels like 
"~<A>" and "not-~<A>". It is natural from the marksman's 
viewpoint to call a bull's-eye a success, but in the mice example 
it is arbitrary which category corresponds to straight hair in a mouse. 
The word "binomial" means "of two names" or "of two terms", 
and both usages apply in our work: the first to the names of the 
two outcomes of a binomial trial, and the second to the terms ~<p> 
and **f that represent the probabilities of "success" and "failure". 
Sometimes when there are many outcomes for a single trial, 
we group these outcomes into two classes, as in the example of the die, 
where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes "ace" and "not-ace". 
_EXPERIMENT WITHOUT THE TWO-CLASS PROPERTY._ We classify 
mice as "straight-haired" or "wavy-haired", but a hairless 
mouse appears. We can escape from such a difficulty by ruling out the 
animal as not constituting a trial, but such a solution is not always 
satisfactory. _3. ALL TRIALS HAVE IDENTICAL PROBABILITIES OF SUCCESS._ 
Each die has probability **f of producing an ace; the marksman 
has some probability ~<p>, perhaps 0.1, of making a bull's-eye. 
Note that we need not know the value of ~<p>, for the experiment 
to be binomial. _EXPERIMENT WHERE ~P IS NOT CONSTANT._ During 
a round of target practice the sun comes from behind a cloud and dazzles 
the marksman, lowering his chance of a bull's-eye. _4. THE 
TRIALS ARE INDEPENDENT._ Strictly speaking, this means that the probability 
for each possible outcome of the experiment can be computed by 
multiplying together the probabilities of the possible outcomes of the 
single binomial trials. Thus in the three-dice example **f, **f, and 
the independence assumption implies that the probability that the three 
dice fall ace, not-ace, ace in that order is (1/6)(5/6)(1/6). Experimentally, 
we expect independence when the trials have nothing to 
do with one another. _EXAMPLES WHERE INDEPENDENCE FAILS._ A family 
of five plans to go together either to the beach or to the mountains, 
and a coin is tossed to decide. We want to know the number of people 
going to the mountains. When this experiment is viewed as composed 
of five binomial trials, one for each member of the family, the outcomes 
of the trials are obviously not independent. Indeed, the experiment 
is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial for the entire 
family. The following is a less extreme example of dependence. Consider 
couples visiting an art museum. Each person votes for one of a pair 
of pictures to receive a popular prize. Voting for one picture may 
be called "success", for the other "failure". An experiment 
consists of the voting of one couple, or two trials. In repetitions 
of the experiment from couple to couple, the votes of the two persons 
in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply, because 
couples who visit the museum together are more likely to have similar 
tastes than are a random pair of people drawn from the entire population 
of visitors. Table 7-1 illustrates the point. The table shows 
that 0.6 of the boys and 0.6 of the girls vote for picture ~<A>. 
Therefore, under independent voting, **f or 0.36 of the couples would 
cast two votes for picture ~<A>, and **f or 0.16 would cast 
two votes for picture ~<B>. Thus in independent voting, **f or 0.52 
of the couples would agree. But Table 7-1 shows that **f or 0.70 agree, 
too many for independent voting.   Each performance of an ~<n>-trial 
binomial experiment results in some whole number from 0 
through ~<n> as the value of the random variable ~<X>, where 
**f. We want to study the <probability function> of this random variable. 
For example, we are interested in the number of bull's-eyes, 
not which shots were bull's-eyes. A binomial experiment can produce 
random variables other than the number of successes. For example, the 
marksman gets 5 shots, but we take his score to be the number of shots 
<before> his first bull's-eye, that is, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 5, if 
he gets no bull's-eye). Thus we do not score the number of bull's-eyes, 
and the random variable is not the number of successes. 
  The constancy of ~<p> and the independence are the conditions most 
likely to give trouble in practice. Obviously, very slight changes 
in ~<p> do not change the probabilities much, and a slight lack of 
independence may not make an appreciable difference. (For instance, 
see Example 2 of Section 5-5, on red cards in hands of 5.) On the 
other hand, even when the binomial model does not describe well the physical 
phenomenon being studied, the binomial model may still be used 
as a baseline for comparative purposes; that is, we may discuss the 
phenomenon in terms of its departures from the binomial model. _TO 
SUMMARIZE:_ A <binomial experiment> consists of **f independent 
binomial trials, all with the same probability **f of yielding a success. 
The outcome of the experiment is ~<X> successes. The random 
variable ~<X> takes the values **f with probabilities **f or, more 
briefly **f.   We shall find a formula for the probability of 
exactly ~<x> successes for given values of ~<p> and ~<n>. 
When 
each number of successes ~<x> is paired with its probability of 
occurrence **f, the set of pairs **f, is a probability function called 
a <binomial distribution>. The choice of ~<p> and ~<n> determines 
the binomial distribution uniquely, and different choices always 
produce different distributions (except when **f; then the number 
of successes is always 0). The set of all binomial distributions is 
called <the family of binomial distributions>, but in general discussions 
this expression is often shortened to "the binomial distribution", 
or even "the binomial" when the context is clear. Binomial distributions 
were treated by James Bernoulli about 1700, and for this 
reason binomial trials are sometimes called <Bernoulli trials>. _RANDOM 
VARIABLES._ Each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produces 
either 0 or 1 success. Therefore each binomial trial can be thought 
of as producing a value of a random variable associated with that 
trial and taking the values 0 and 1, with probabilities ~<q> and 
~<p> respectively. The several trials of a binomial experiment 
produce a new random variable ~<X>, the total number of successes, 
which is just the sum of the random variables associated with the single 
trials. _EXAMPLE 2._ The marksman gets two bull's-eyes, one 
on his third shot and one on his fifth. The numbers of successes on 
the five individual shots are, then, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1. The number of successes 
on each shot is a value of a random variable that has values 0 
or 1, and there are 5 such random variables here. Their sum is ~<X>, 
the total number of successes, which in this experiment has the 
value **f.

Consider a simple, closed, plane curve ~<C> which is a real-analytic 
image of the unit circle, and which is given by **f. These 
are real analytic periodic functions with period ~<T>. In the 
following paper it is shown that in a certain definite sense, exactly 
an odd number of squares can be inscribed in every such curve which does 
not contain an infinite number of inscribed squares. This theorem 
is similar to the theorem of Kakutani that there exists a circumscribing 
cube around any closed, bounded convex set in **f. The latter theorem 
has been generalized by Yamabe and Yujobo, and Cairns to show 
that in **f there are families of such cubes. Here, for the case of 
squares inscribed in plane curves, we remove the restriction to convexity 
and give certain other results.   A square inscribed in a curve 
~<C> means a square with its four corner points on the curve, 
though it may not lie entirely in the interior of ~<C>. Indeed, 
the spiral **f, with the two endpoints connected by a straight line possesses 
only one inscribed square. The square has one corner point on 
the straight line segment, and does not lie entirely in the interior.

On ~<C>, from the point ~<P> at **f to the point ~<Q> 
at **f, we construct the chord, and upon the chord as a side 
erect a square in such a way that as ~<s> approaches zero the square 
is inside ~<C>. As ~<s> increases we consider the two free 
corner points of the square, **f and **f, adjacent to ~<P> and ~<Q> 
respectively. As ~<s> approaches ~<T> the square will 
be outside ~<C> and therefore both **f and **f must cross ~<C> 
an odd number of times as ~<s> varies from zero to ~<T>. 
The points may also touch ~<C> without crossing.   Suppose 
**f crosses ~<C> when **f. We now have certain squares with three 
corners on ~<C>. For any such square the middle corner of these 
will be called the vertex of the square and the corner not on the 
curve will be called the diagonal point of the square. Each point on 
~<C>, as a vertex, may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal 
points by the above construction.   To each paired vertex 
and diagonal point there corresponds a unique forward corner point, 
i&e&, the corner on ~<C> reached first by proceeding along ~<C> 
from the vertex in the direction of increasing ~<t>. If the 
vertex is at **f, and if the interior of ~<C> is on the left as 
one moves in the direction of increasing ~<t>, then every such corner 
can be found from the curve obtained by rotating ~<C> clockwise 
through 90` about the vertex. The set of intersections of **f, 
the rotated curve, with the original curve ~<C> consists of just 
the set of forward corner points on ~<C> corresponding to the vertex 
at **f, plus the vertex itself. We note that two such curves ~<C> 
and **f, cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points; 
otherwise, being analytic, they would coincide at all points, which 
is impossible since they do not coincide near **f.   With each 
vertex we associate certain numerical values, namely the set of positive 
differences in the parameter ~<t> between the vertex and its corresponding 
forward corner points. For the vertex at **f, these values 
will be denoted by **f. The function ~<f(t)> defined in this way 
is multi-valued.   We consider now the graph of the function 
~<f(t)> on **f. We will refer to the plane of ~<C> and **f as 
the ~<C>-plane and to the plane of the graph as the ~<f>-plane. 
The graph, as a set, may have a finite number of components. We 
will denote the values of ~<f(t)> on different components by **f. 
Each point with abscissa ~<t> on the graph represents an intersection 
between ~<C> and **f. There are two types of such intersections, 
depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point 
of intersection. An <ordinary> point will be any point of intersection 
~<A> such that in every neighborhood of ~<A> in the ~<C>-plane, 
**f meets both the interior and the exterior of ~<C>. 
Any other point of intersection between ~<C> and **f will be called 
a <tangent> point. This terminology will also be applied to the 
corresponding points in the ~<f>-plane. We can now prove several 
lemmas. 

#LEMMA 1.#

<In some neighborhood in the ~f-plane of 
any ordinary point of the graph, the function ~f is a single-valued, 
continuous function>. _PROOF._ We first show that the function 
is 
single-valued in some neighborhood. With the vertex at **f in the ~<C>-plane 
we assume that **f is the parametric location on ~<C> 
of an ordinary intersection ~<Q> between ~<C> and **f. In 
the ~<f>-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are 
**f. We know that in the ~<C>-plane both ~<C> and **f are analytic. 
In the ~<C>-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian 
coordinates ~<u>, ~<v> with the origin at ~<Q> and 
such that both ~<C> and **f have finite slope at ~<Q>. Near 
~<Q>, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of 
~<u>. 
In a neighborhood of ~<Q> the difference between these 
functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of ~<u>. Furthermore, 
one can find a neighborhood of ~<Q> in which the difference 
function is monotone, for since it is analytic it can have only 
a finite number of extrema in any interval. Now, to find **f, one needs 
the intersection of ~<C> and **f near ~<Q>. But **f is just 
the curve **f translated without rotation through a small arc, for 
**f is always obtained by rotating ~<C> through exactly 90`. The 
arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve. Thus if ~<e> is 
sufficiently 
small, there can be only one intersection of ~<C> and 
**f near ~<Q>, for if there were more than one intersection for every 
~<e> then the difference between ~<C> and **f near ~<Q> 
would not be a monotone function. Therefore, **f is single-valued 
near ~<Q>. It is also seen that **f, since the change from **f 
to **f is accomplished by a continuous translation. Thus **f is also 
continuous at **f, and in a neighborhood of **f which does not contain 
a tangent point.   We turn now to the set of tangent points on 
the graph. This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals. 
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except 
in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1, namely, 
that near any tangent point in the ~<C>-plane the curves ~<C> 
and **f are analytic, and therefore the difference between them 
must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the 
tangent point. This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence 
of isolated tangent points. 

#LEMMA 2.#

<In some neighborhood of 
an 
isolated tangent point in the ~f-plane, say **f, the function **f is 
either double-valued or has no values defined, except at the tangent 
point itself, where it is single-valued>. _PROOF._ A tangent point 
~<Q> in the ~<C>-plane occurs when ~<C> and **f are 
tangent to one another. A continuous change in ~<t> through an amount 
~<e> results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve 
**f. There are three possibilities: (a) **f remains tangent to 
~<C> as it is translated; (b) **f moves away from ~<C> and 
does not intersect it at all for **f; (c) **f cuts across ~<C> 
and there are two ordinary intersections for every ~<t> in **f. The 
first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points 
in the ~<f>-plane, the end points of which fall into category (b) 
or (c). In the second category the function **f has no values defined 
in a neighborhood **f. In the third category the function is double-valued 
in this interval. The same remarks apply to an interval on the 
other side of **f. Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantee 
that such intervals exist. In the neighborhood of an end point of an 
interval of tangent points in the ~<f>-plane the function is two-valued 
or no-valued on one side, and is a single-valued function consisting 
entirely of tangent points on the other side.   With the 
above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of ~<f>. 
First, for any value of ~<t> for which all values of ~<f(t)> 
are ordinary points the number of values of ~<f(t)> must be 
odd. For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections 
of ~<C> and **f must be even (otherwise, starting in the interior 
of ~<C>, **f could not finally return to the interior), and the 
center of rotation at ~<t> is the argument of the function, not a 
value. Therefore, for any value of ~<t> the number of values of 
~<f(t)> is equal to the (finite) number of tangent points corresponding 
to the argument ~<t> plus an odd number. 

#DEFINITION.#

The 
number of ordinary values of the function ~<f(t)> at ~<t> 
will be called its multiplicity at ~<t>. 

#LEMMA 3.#

<The graph 
of ~f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval 
~[0,<T>]. _PROOF_ We suppose not. Then every component 
of the graph of ~<f> must be defined over a bounded sub-interval. 
Suppose **f is defined in the sub-interval **f. Now **f and **f 
must both be tangent points on the ~<n>th component in the ~<f>-plane; 
otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond 
these points. Further, we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of 
~<f> can only change at a tangent point, and at such a point can 
only change by an even integer. Thus the multiplicity of **f for a given 
~<t> must be an even number. This is true of all components 
which have such a bounded support. But this is a contradiction, for we 
know that the multiplicity of ~<f(t)> is odd for every ~<t>.

We have shown that the graph of ~<f> contains at least one 
component whose inverse is the entire interval ~[0,<T>], and 
whose multiplicity is odd. There must be an odd number of such components, 
which will be called complete components. The remaining (incomplete) 
components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument, 
and are defined only on a proper 
sub-interval of ~[0,<T>].

We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist 
two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the ~<C>-plane 
are on opposite sides of ~<C>. We again consider a 
fixed point ~<P> at **f and a variable point ~<Q> at **f on 
~<C>. We erect a square with ~<PQ> as a side and with free 
corners **f and **f adjacent to ~<P> and ~<Q> respectively. 
As ~<s> varies from zero to ~<T>, the values of ~<s> for 
which **f and **f <cross> ~<C> will be denoted by **f and **f 
respectively. We have **f, plus tangent points. These ~<s>-values 
are just the ordinary values of **f. 

#LEMMA 4.#

<The values **f 
are the ordinary values at **f of a multi-valued function ~<g(t)> 
which has components corresponding to those of ~<f(t)>. _PROOF._ 
We first define a function ~<b(t)> as follows: given the 
set of squares such that each has three corners on ~<C> and vertex 
at ~<t>, ~<b(t)> is the corresponding set of positive parametric 
differences between ~<t> and the <backward> corner points. 
The functions ~<f> and ~<b> have exactly the same multiplicity 
at every argument ~<t>. Now with ~<P> fixed at **f, **f-values 
occur when the corner **f crosses ~<C>, and are among the values 
of ~<s> such that **f. The roots of this equation are just the 
ordinates of the intersections of the graph of ~<b> with a straight 
line of unit slope through **f in the ~<b>-plane (the plane of 
the graph of ~<b>). We define these values as **f, and define ~<g(t)> 
in the same way for each ~<t>. Thus we obtain ~<g(t)> 
by introducing an oblique ~<g(t)>-axis in the ~<b>-plane. 

#INTRODUCTION.#

In @1 we investigate a new series of line involutions 
in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex 
numbers. These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation 
of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface 
bearing a curve of symbol **f. Then in @2 we show that any line 
involution with the properties that (a) It has no complex of invariant 
lines, and (b) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively 
of the lines which meet a twisted curve, is necessarily of the 
type discussed in @1. No generalization of these results to spaces 
of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible. 

#1.# 

Let ~<Q> be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli **f 
and **f, and let ~\g be a **f curve of order ~<k> on ~<Q>. 
A 
general line ~<l> meets ~<Q> in two points, **f and **f, through 
each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus, **f, whose 
lines are simple secants of ~\g. On these generators let **f and 
**f be, respectively, the harmonic conjugates of **f and **f with respect 
to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets ~\g. 
The line **f is the image of ~<l>. Clearly, the transformation 
is involutorial.   We observe first that no line, ~<l>, 
can meet its image except at one of its intersections with ~<Q>. 
For if it did, the plane of ~<l> and ~<l'> would contain 
two generators of **f, which is impossible. Moreover, from the definitive 
transformation of intercepts on the generators of **f, it is clear 
that the only points of ~<Q> at which a line can meets its image 
are the points of ~\g. Hence the totality of singular lines is 
the ~<k>th order complex of lines which meet ~\g.   The 
invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of ~\g, 
since each of these meets ~<Q> in two points which are invariant. 
The order of this congruence is **f, since **f secants of a curve of 
symbol ~(<a,b>) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point. 
The class of the congruence is **f, since an arbitrary plane meets 
~\g in ~<k> points.   Since the complex of singular 
lines is of order ~<k> and since there is no complex of invariant 
lines, it follows from the formula **f that the order of the involution 
is **f.   There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines 
whose images are not unique. The most obvious of these is the quadratic 
complex of tangents to ~<Q>, each line of which is transformed 
into the entire pencil of lines tangent to ~<Q> at the image 
of the point of tangency of the given line. Thus pencils of 
tangents to ~<Q> are transformed into pencils of tangents. It is 
interesting that a 1:1 correspondence can be established between the 
lines of two such pencils, so that in a sense a unique image can actually 
be assigned to each tangent. For the lines of any plane, ~|p, 
meeting ~<Q> in a conic ~<C>, are transformed into the congruence 
of secants of the curve ~<C'> into which ~<C> is 
transformed in the point involution on ~<Q>. In particular, tangents 
to ~<C> are transformed into tangents to ~<C'>. Moreover, 
if **f and **f are two planes intersecting in a line ~<l>, tangent 
to ~<Q> at a point ~<P>, the two free intersections of 
the image curves **f and **f must coincide at ~<P'>, the image 
of ~<P>, and at this point **f and **f must have a common tangent 
~<l'>. Hence, thought of as a line in a particular plane ~|p, 
any tangent to ~<Q> has a unique image and moreover this image 
is the same for all planes through ~<l>.   Each generator, 
~|l, of **f is also exceptional, for each is transformed into the 
entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator 
is transformed by the point involution on ~<Q>. This curve is of 
symbol **f since it meets ~|l, and hence every line of **f in the 
**f invariant points on ~|l and since it obviously meets every line 
of **f in a single point. The congruence of its secants is therefore 
of order **f and class **f.   A final class of exceptional lines 
is identifiable from the following considerations: Since no two 
generators of **f can intersect, it follows that their image curves 
can have no free intersections. In other words, these curves have only 
fixed intersections common to them all. Now the only way in which all 
curves of the image family of **f can pass through a fixed point is 
to have a generator of **f which is not a secant but a tangent of ~\g, 
for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into 
the point of tangency. Since two curves of symbol **f on ~<Q> intersect 
in **f points, it follows that there are **f lines of **f which 
are tangent to ~\g. Clearly, any line, ~<l>, of any bundle 
having one of these points of tangency, ~<T>, as vertex will be transformed 
into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection 
of ~<l> and ~<Q> as vertex and lying in the plane determined 
by the image point and the generator of **f which is tangent to 
~\g at ~<T>. A line through two of these points, **f and **f, 
will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the 
tangents to ~\g at **f and **f as directrices.   A conic, ~<C>, 
being a (1, 1) curve on ~<Q>, meets the image of any line 
of **f, which we have already found to be a **f curve on ~<Q>, 
in **f points. Hence its image, ~<C'>, meets any line of **f 
in **f points. Moreover, ~<C'> obviously meets any line **f in 
a single point. Hence ~<C'> is a **f curve on ~<Q>. Therefore, 
the congruence of its secants, that is the image of a general 
plane field of lines, is of order **f and class **f. Finally, the image 
of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order 
of the congruence of invariant lines, namely **f and whose class is 
the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines, 
namely **f. 

#2.#

The preceding observations make it clear that there 
exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex 
of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively 
of the lines which meet a twisted curve ~\g. We now shall 
show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily 
of the type we have just described.   To do this we must first 
show that every line which meets ~\g in a point ~<P> meets its 
image at ~<P>. To see this, consider a general pencil of lines 
containing a general secant of ~\G. By (1), the image of this pencil 
is a ruled surface of order **f which is met by the plane of the 
pencil in a curve, ~<C>, of order **f. On ~<C> there is a 
**f correspondence in which the **f points cut from ~<C> by a general 
line, ~<l>, of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection 
of the image of ~<l> and the plane of the pencil. Since ~<C> 
is rational, this correspondence has ~<k> coincidences, each 
of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image. However, 
since the pencil contains a secant of ~\g it actually contains only 
**f singular lines. To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that 
~<C> be composite, with the secant of ~\g and a curve of 
order **f as components. Thus it follows that the secants of ~\g 
are all invariant. But if this is the case, then an arbitrary pencil 
of lines having a point, ~<P>, of ~\g as vertex is transformed 
into a ruled surface of order **f having **f generators concurrent at 
~<P>. Since a ruled surface of order ~<n> with ~<n> concurrent 
generators 
is necessarily a cone, it follows finally that every line through 
a point, ~<P>, of ~\g meets its image at ~<P>, as asserted.

Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle 
with vertex, ~<P>, on ~\g which is effected by the involution 
as a whole. From the preceding remarks, it is clear that such a bundle 
is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion. Moreover, 
in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order **f, namely 
the cone of secants of ~\g which pass through ~<P>. Hence 
it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective 
de Jonquieres involution of order **f and the invariant locus must 
have a multiple line of multiplicity either **f or **f. The first possibility 
requires that there be a line through ~<P> which meets 
~\g in **f points; the second requires that there be a line through 
~<P> which meets ~\g in **f points. In each case, lines 
of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they 
determine with the multiple secant. In the first case the fixed elements 
within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the 
vertex, ~<P>, to the intersection of ~\g and the plane of 
the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant. In the second, 
the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex, ~<P>, to 
the two intersections of ~\g and the plane of the pencil which do 
not lie on the multiple secant. The multiple secants, of course, are 
exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order **f.

Observations similar to these can be made at each point of ~\g. 
Hence ~\g must have either a regulus of **f-fold secants or 
a regulus of **f-fold secants. Moreover, if **f, no two of the multiple 
secants can intersect. For if such were the case, either the plane 
of the two lines would meet ~\g in more than ~<k> points or, 
alternatively, the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined 
by the two lines would be too high. But if no two lines of the regulus 
of multiple secants of ~\g can intersect, then the regulus must 
be quadratic, or in other words, ~\g must be either a **f or a **f 
curve on a nonsingular quadric surface.   We now observe that 
the case in which ~\g is a **f curve on a quadric is impossible if 
the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which 
meet ~\g. For any pencil in a plane containing a **f-fold secant 
of ~\g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil 
in **f lines, namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass 
through the intersection of ~\g and the multiple secant, plus an additional 
component to account for the intersections of the images of 
the general lines of the pencil. However, if there is no additional complex 
of singular lines, the order of the image regulus of a pencil is 
precisely **f. This contradicts the preceding observations, and so, 
under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that 
~\g is a **f curve on a quadric surface.   Continuing with 
the case in which ~\g is a **f curve on a quadric ~<Q>, we first 
observe that the second regulus of ~<Q> consists precisely of 
the lines which join the two free intersections of ~\g and the planes 
through any one of the multiple secants. For each of these lines 
meets ~<Q> in three points, namely two points on ~\g and one 
point on one of the multiple secants.   Now consider an arbitrary 
line, ~<l>, meeting ~<Q> in two points, **f and **f. If 
~|a is the multiple secant of ~\g which passes through **f and 
~|b is the simple secant of ~\g which passes through **f, and 
if **f are the points in which ~|a meets ~\g, and if **f is the 
image of **f on the generator ~|b, it follows that the image of 
the line **f is **f.

These societies can expect to face difficult times. As the historic 
processes of modernization gradually gain momentum, their cohesion 
will be threatened by divisive forces, the gaps between rulers and 
subjects, town and country, will widen; new aspirants for power will 
emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may 
lose their nerve and their sense of direction. National leaders will 
have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people 
through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's 
sense of identity. Feelings of a community of interest will have to 
be recreated- in some of the new nations, indeed, they must be built 
for the first time- on a new basis which looks toward the future and 
does not rely only on shared memories of the past. Nevertheless, with 
foresight and careful planning, some of the more disruptive and dangerous 
consequences of social change which have troubled other countries 
passing through this stage can be escaped. The United States can 
help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries 
face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms 
of assistance where possible.   Our central goal should be 
to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle 
boldly the tasks which they face. At the same time, we should recognize 
that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability 
which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone 
to diversions and external adventures of all sorts. It may seem to some 
of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing 
in the 
murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable 
tasks at home. We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion, 
both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting 
firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene. When necessary, 
we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal 
advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for 
disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but 
also risk their own prospects for orderly development. As a nation, 
we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development; 
but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly 
seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world 
community. 

#TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES#

When we look at countries like 
Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Burma, where substantial progress has been 
made 
in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital, 
and where institutions of centralized government exist, we find 
a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence 
different priorities for policy. The men in power are committed 
in principle to modernization, but economic and social changes are proceeding 
only erratically. Isolated enterprises have been launched, but 
they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern. The 
society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban 
sector and a relatively untouched rural sector, with very poor communications 
between the two. Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions 
to effective action among those in power and by a failure on 
their part to understand how local resources, human and material, can 
be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically 
accepted.   Most countries in this second category share 
the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political 
and social system without the modern standards of performance required 
to make them effective. In these rapidly changing societies there 
is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals. 
The colonial period has generally left people believing that government 
can, if it wishes, provide all manner of services for them- 
and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the 
benefits of modern life. For example, in accordance with the fashion 
of the times, most transitional societies have announced economic development 
plans of varying numbers of years; such is the mystique of 
planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow 
automatically upon its announcement. The civil services in such societies 
are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing 
them; and their members often equate a government career with security 
and status rather than with sacrifice, self-discipline, and competence.

American policy should press constantly the view that 
until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their 
bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize 
of democratize their societies. We should spread the view that 
planning and national development are serious matters which call for 
effort as well as enthusiasm. Above all, we should seek to encourage 
the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they 
are responsible for their fates. Only within the framework of a mature 
relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can 
we provide telling assistance. With respect to those countries whose 
leaders prefer to live with their illusions, we can afford to wait, 
for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all 
to see.   Our technical assistance to these countries should 
place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the 
role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts 
assumed in dealing with the central governments. We should encourage 
the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities, 
state and provincial governments, rural communities, and other smaller 
groups, making certain that no important segment of the economy is 
neglected. Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships 
of technical progress in various fields, showing how agricultural 
training can be introduced into education, how health affects labor 
productivity, how small business can benefit the rural farm community, 
and, above all, how progress in each field relates to national progress. 
Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines 
have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward 
balanced national development. To achieve this goal of balanced development, 
communications between the central government and the local communities 
must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves 
are effectively taken into account. If modernization programs 
are imposed from above, without the understanding and cooperation of 
the people, they will encounter grave difficulties.   Land reform 
is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries. It should 
be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform 
programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic 
growth and modernization of the society. As an isolated policy, 
land reform is likely to be politically disruptive; as part of a larger 
development effort, however, it may gain wide acceptance. It should 
also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved 
by administrative decrees alone. Land reform programs need to be 
supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance 
in agriculture.   Lastly, governmental and private planners 
will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming 
ahead. By holding out prospects for external capital assistance, the 
United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted 
economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth. 

#ACTIVELY 
MODERNIZING SOCIETIES#

At a third stage in the modernization 
process are such countries as India, Brazil, the Philippines, and 
Taiwan, which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining 
growth. They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs; 
and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity 
around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing 
participation in the program to wider and wider groups. 
But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary 
human and social overhead capital; they have established reasonably 
stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local 
levels; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically 
and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies.

On the economic front, the first priority of these countries 
is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources. Several related 
tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved. 
These countries must formulate a comprehensive, long-term program 
covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors 
of the economy. They must in their planning be able to count on at least 
tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods 
of several years. Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must 
be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment 
programming to go forward. Capital flows must be coordinated with 
national needs and planning. Finally, a balance must be effected among 
project finance, utilization of agricultural surpluses, and general 
balance of payments support.   Thus, although the agenda of external 
assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative, and many of the 
policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant, 
the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages 
of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining 
growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange.

There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved. 
For one thing, although considerable numbers of men have been trained, 
bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects; even the 
famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous 
range of tasks it has undertaken. Technical assistance in training middle- 
and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases. 
There are also more basic problems. This is the stage at which democratic 
developments must take place if the society is to become an 
open community of creative people. Nevertheless, impulses still exist 
among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need 
for centralized and authoritarian practices. Another great danger is 
that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated 
from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference 
to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism. 
The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional 
classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to 
be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their 
own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts 
in the West. Particularly when based upon a single dominant party, 
governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of 
understanding about the national interest. Convinced of the wisdom of 
their own actions, and reassured by the promises of their economic development 
programs, governments may fail to push outward to win more 
and more people to the national effort, becoming instead more rigid and 
inflexible in their policies.   American policy toward such societies 
should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional 
classes. It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation 
of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers 
and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies. We 
have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic 
and free countries; we also have, in consequence, the duty to appraise 
realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate 
our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways. 

#THE TIME 
FACTOR#

We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society 
will take a considerable period of time. With the exception of 
treaty-making, foreign relations were historically concerned for the 
most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration. Foreign 
policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled 
not merely at response but also at projection. American and free-world 
policies can marginally affect the pace of transition; but basically 
that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in 
the human attitudes, political institutions, and social structure which 
each society must generate. It follows that any effective policy toward 
the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working 
horizon. It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have 
not always been its trademark.   This condition affects not only 
the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign 
policy, especially in the context of economic aid. 
#/2,: SOME OF THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF RELIGION#

The place of 
religion in the simple, preliterate societies is quite definite; as 
a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly 
in every part of it. In societies like ours, however, its place 
is less clear and more complex. With the diversity of religious viewpoints, 
there are differences of opinion as to the essential features 
of religion; and there are different opinions as to the essential 
functions of religion. Nevertheless, for most of the population of heterogeneous 
advanced societies, though less for the less religious portion, 
religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions.

Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct 
significance in social organization, they have important indirect consequences. 
If the inner functions of religion are performed, the individual 
is a composed, ordered, motivated, and emotionally secure associate; 
he is not greatly frustrated, and he is not anomic; he is 
better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows. There are 
several closely related inner functions.   In the last analysis, 
religion is the means of inducing, formulating, expressing, enhancing, 
implementing, and perpetuating man's deepest experience- the religious. 
Man is first religious; the instrumentalities follow. Religion 
seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence. The significant 
things in it, at the higher religious levels, are the inner emotional, 
mental, and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs 
of self-preservation, self-pacification, and self-completion. The chief 
experience is the sensing of communion, and in the higher religions, 
of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power. Related to 
this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual 
his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively 
secure in an ordered, dependable universe. Man has the experience 
of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand; 
he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and 
movement. The universe is a safe and permanent home.   A number 
of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the 
ultimate and eternal. Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance; 
man has a second chance. He is not lost in the abyss of endless 
time; he has endless being. Religion at its best also offers the 
experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm 
of the spirit. Religion can summate, epitomize, relate, and conserve 
all the highest ideals and values- ethical, aesthetic, and religious- 
of man formed in his culture.   There is also the possibility, 
among higher religions, of experiencing consistent meaning in life 
and enjoying guidance and expansiveness. The kind of religious experience 
that most moderns seek not only provides, clarifies, and relates 
human yearnings, values, ideals, and purposes; it also provides facilities 
and incitements for the development of personality, sociality, 
and creativeness. Under the religious impulse, whether theistic or 
humanistic, men have joy in living; life leads somewhere. Religion 
at its best is out in front, ever beckoning and leading on, and, as Lippman 
put it, "mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant 
sense of his own infinite importance".   At the same 
time 
that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and 
gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment, it also has 
great therapeutic value for him. It gives him aid, comfort, even solace, 
in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical 
knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate. He is confronted 
with the recurrent crises, such as great natural catastrophes and 
the great transitions of life- marriage, incurable disease, widowhood, 
old age, the certainty of death. He has to cope with frustration 
and other emotional disturbance and anomie. His religious beliefs provide 
him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause 
him great concern, and his religious faith makes possible fortitude, equanimity, 
and consolation, enabling him to endure colossal misfortune, 
fear, frustration, uncertainty, suffering, evil, and danger. Religion 
usually also includes a principle of compensation, mainly in a promised 
perfect future state.   The belief in immortality, where held, 
functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here 
and now. The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing 
or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less 
self-contained or self-sufficient by confession, repentance, and penance. 
The feeling of individual inferiority, defeat, or humilation growing 
out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures 
is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly, 
but all-victorious Father-God, as well as by sympathetic fellowship 
with others who share this faith, and by opportunities in religious 
acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.   In providing 
for these inner individual functions, religion undertakes in behalf 
of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is 
no other institution.   In addition to the functions of religion 
within man, there have always been the outer social functions for the 
community and society. The two have never been separable. Religion 
is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation.

The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with, 
and to a degree dependent upon, a more or less shared system of religious 
beliefs and convictions. The religion supports, re-enforces, 
reaffirms, and maintains the fundamental values. Even in the united 
states, with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast 
denominational differentiation, there is a general consensus regarding 
the basic Christian values. This is demonstrated especially when there 
is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere; 
for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those 
of atheistic communism. In America also all of our major religious bodies 
officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of 
our common religion. Even the non-church members- the freewheelers, 
marginal religionists and so on- have the values of Christian civilization 
internalized in them. Furthermore, religion tends to integrate 
the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God 
to the intermediary and subordinate values; for example, those regarding 
material objects and pragmatic ends. Finally, it gives sanctity, 
more than human legitimacy, and even, through super-empirical reference, 
transcendent and supernatural importance to some values; for example, 
marriage as a sacrament, much law-breaking as sinful, occasionally 
the state as a divine instrument. It places certain values at least 
beyond questioning and tampering.   Closely related to this 
function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate 
ends for the society, which are compatible with the supreme eternal 
ends. This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social 
Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends; for example, 
a plan that fulfills the will of God, which advances the Kingdom 
of God, which involves social life as part of the Grand Design. 
This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their 
primacy. It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs 
of social action. Finally, it gives meaning to much social endeavor, 
and logic, consistency, and meaning to life. In general, there is no 
society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired 
transcendental ends.   Religion integrates and unifies. Some 
of the oldest, most persistent, and most cohesive forms of social groupings 
have grown out of religion. These groups have varied widely from 
mere families, primitive, totemic groups, and small modern cults and 
sects, to the memberships of great denominations, and great, widely 
dispersed world religions. Religion fosters group life in various ways. 
The common ultimate values, ends and goals fostered by religion are 
a most important factor. Without a system of values there can be no 
society. Where such a value system prevails, it always unifies all 
who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system. 
The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed 
in creeds, dogmas, and doctrines, and form what Durkheim calls a credo. 
As he points out, a religious group cannot exist without a collective 
credo, and the more extensive the credo, the more unified and strong 
is the group. The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching 
them completely to an identical body of doctrine; the more extensive 
and firm the body of doctrine, the firmer the group.   The religious 
symbolism, and especially the closely related rites and worship 
forms, constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith. 
The religion, in fact, is an expression of the unity of the group, 
small or large. The common codes, for religious action as such and 
in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior, bind the devotees 
together. These are ways of jointly participating in significantly 
symbolized, standardized, and ordered religiously sanctified behavior. 
The codes are mechanism for training in, and directing and enforcing, 
uniform social interaction, and for continually and publicly reasserting 
the solidarity of the group.   Durkheim noted long ago that 
religion as "**h a unified system of beliefs and practices relative 
to sacred things **h unite[s] into one single moral community **h 
all 
those who adhere to them". His view is that every religion pertains 
to 
a community, and, conversely, every community is in one aspect a religious 
unit. This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails 
even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular 
semi-public and public occasions in the United States; and it is 
evidenced in the prayers offered, in the frequent religious allusions, 
and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds.   The 
unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically 
peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural 
units, with religion as the dominant bond, even though spatially dispersed 
and not politically organized. The Jews for 2500 years have been 
a prime example, though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion 
are cases in point. it might be pointed out that the integrating 
function of religion, for good or ill, has often supported or been 
identified with other groupings- political, nationality, language, class, 
racial, sociability, even economic.   Religion usually exercises 
a stabilizing-conserving function. As such it acts as an anchor 
for the people. There is a marked tendency for religions, once firmly 
established, to resist change, not only in their own doctrines and policies 
and practices, but also in secular affairs having religious relevance. 
It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of 
social values, though also in some measure, an obstacle to the creation 
or diffusion of new ones. It tends to support the longstanding precious 
sentiments, the traditional ways of thinking, and the customary ways 
of living. As Yinger has pointed out, the "**h reliance on symbols, 
on tradition, on sacred writings, on the cultivation of emotional 
feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values, turns one to the 
past far more than to the future". Historically, religion has also 
functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication, enforcement, sanction, 
and perpetuation of various other institutions.   At the same 
time that religion exercises a conserving influence, it also energizes 
and motivates both individuals and groups. Much of the important 
individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives. The 
great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon 
lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force, 
mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices; for example, the Crusades, 
mission efforts, just wars. Much effort has been expended in the 
sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion. The 
insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating 
effects. Religion provides the most attractive rewards, either 
in this world or the next, for those who not merely abide by its norms, 
but who engage in good works.   Religion usually acts as a 
powerful 
aid in social control, enforcing what men should or should not 
do. Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were 
more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group; 
and in modern societies such influence is still great. Religion has 
its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes 
of behavior for the here and now. 
Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about 
persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income, 
her defense of denial was excessively strong. Thus the lack of effective 
recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two 
babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem. The result, dramatically 
visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily 
functioning, was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall 
the second twin, whose birth had not been anticipated. Soon Mrs& 
B&'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning 
the welfare of the entire family. Inability to care for the other 
children, difficulty in feeding the babies, who seemed colicky, bone-weary 
fatigue, repeated crying episodes, and short tempers reflected 
the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation. Clearly, 
this was a family in crisis.   Mrs& B& compared her 
feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at 
the time of her mother's death when she was eight, as well as her subsequent 
anger at her father for remarrying. Her previous traumatic experiences 
flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday. 
On the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized 
tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral. 
In the family's own words (during the third of twelve visits), they 
had "reached the crisis peak- either the situation will give or 
we 
will break"!   Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs& 
B&'s anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears 
of annihilation. Abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the 
death of her parents, when linked up with her current feelings of anger 
and her fears of loss, abandonment, and annihilation, produced further 
relief of tension. In a joint interview Mr& and Mrs& B& were 
helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away 
from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the 
arrival of the twins. The father, accurately perceiving the child's 
needs, not only respected them as worthy of his attention, but immediately 
satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins, 
saying, "I have a big lap; there is room for you, too, Johnnie". 
Simultaneously, a variety of environmental supports- a calm but 
not 
too motherly homemaker, referral for temporary economic aid, intelligent 
use of nursing care, accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical 
advice on the twins' feeding problem- combined to prevent further 
development of predictable pathological mechanisms. Follow-up visits 
of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the 
care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's 
day-to-day mental health and social functioning.   As seen 
in the B& family, there must be an attempt to help the client develop 
conscious awareness of the problem, especially in the absence of a 
formal request for assistance. The lack of awareness usually springs 
from deep but disguised anxiety, often assuming the superficial guise 
of "not knowing" or "not caring". The unhealthy use of denial 
in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium 
of a positive controlled transference. In general, the approach is 
more active than passive, more out-reaching than reflective. While some 
regression is inevitable, it is discouraged rather than encouraged 
so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression 
associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic 
model for insight therapy.   To establish an emotionally meaningful 
relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness 
immediately, preferably within the first interview, by meeting 
the client's specific needs. These needs usually concern the reduction 
of guilt and some relief of tension. The initial interview must 
be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking 
sense. In this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate 
confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem. In 
so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind 
of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness 
generally associated with the first stages of stress impact. 
Thus, the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive 
efforts on his own behalf. Here there is a specific preventive component 
which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation. 
We are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue 
regression, unhealthy suppression and repression, excessive use of 
denial, and crippling guilt turned against the self. While some suppression 
and some denial are not only necessary but healthy, the worker's 
clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used, 
what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated, and when 
efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed.

In steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive 
responses, the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques 
of specific emotional support, clarification, and anticipatory guidance. 
Over a relatively short period of time, usually about four to twelve 
weeks, the worker must be able to shift the focus, back and forth, 
between immediate external stressful exigencies ("precipitating stress") 
and the key, emotionally relevant issues ("underlying problem") 
which are, often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough, reactivated 
by the crisis situation, and hence once again amenable to resolution. 
Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques, they 
do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the 
spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments. 
Then, too, the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously 
combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits, single and group 
office interviews, and appropriate telephone follow-up calls, if 
the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy 
outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles 
of preventive intervention. In addition, in many cases, a variety of 
concrete social resources- homemaker, day care, medical and financial 
aid- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to 
bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative 
efforts. At certain critical stages, and only for sound diagnostic 
reasons, it may be important to accompany family members in their use 
of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive 
rather than defeating. While expensive in time and involving 
a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker (in terms of his 
willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into 
the client's life), techniques of accompaniment were found to be of 
tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives. 
Finally, whatever the techniques used, a twin goal is common to all 
preventive casework service: to cushion or reduce the force of the 
stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family 
members to mobilize and use their ego capacities.   Having outlined 
an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework, we 
now address ourselves to our final question: What place should brief, 
crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of 
services? We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy 
of values, locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term 
intensive service at the top, instead of seeing the services as part 
of a continuum, each important in its own right. This problem is perhaps 
as old as social casework itself. Almost three decades ago Bertha 
Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of 
her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected 
place in our network of social services. Her conclusion has been borne 
out in the experience of many practitioners: "**h short-contact 
interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but 
is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work". 
Thus, 
casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be 
regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the 
quantity of time expended.   That we are experiencing an upsurge 
of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of 
brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling 
of current literature. Especially noteworthy is Levinger's finding 
that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of 
successful outcome. According to a number of studies, the important 
predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as 
well as the accessibility of the helping person. For example, the level 
of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of 
immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably 
with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where 
the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the 
number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental 
project. Of startling significance, too, is the assertion that 
it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition 
rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable 
group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated 
child guidance services. These reports refer to a level of secondary 
prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route 
of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people. 
Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in 
the prompt establishment of a helping relationship, quick appraisal of 
key issues, and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the 
essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in 
dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses. While there 
are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention, 
the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings 
all point up the importance of an <immediate> response to the client's 
initial need for help. In some programs, treatment is concentrated 
over a short period of time, while in others, after the initial 
contact is established, flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally 
used with apparent success. Willingness to take the risk of 
early and direct interpretation (with the proviso that if the interpretation 
is too threatening, the worker can withdraw) is another prominent 
feature in these efforts. My aim in mentioning this factor obviously 
is not to give license to "wild therapy" but rather to encourage 
us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess, 
and to use them with greater confidence, precision, and professional 
pride.   Though there is obviously great need for continued 
experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further 
efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at 
the secondary- or perhaps, in some instances, primary- level, the 
place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number 
of investigators in a wide variety of settings. Woodward, for example, 
has emphasized the "need for a broad spectrum of services, including 
very brief services in connection with critical situations". Ideally, 
brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice 
rather 
than as a treatment of chance. Moreover, the shortage of treatment 
resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower 
force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention 
techniques to make services more widely available- and on a 
more effective basis to more people. Further research in the meaning 
of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework 
services- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures, 
crisis problems, reaction mechanisms, and differential treatment 
approaches- and the establishment of new experimental programs are 
imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers 
in collaboration with community planners.   our literature 
is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive 
agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the 
globally utopian. Probably, in the immediate future, we will have to 
settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models. Increased 
experimentation with multipurpose agencies, especially those 
that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare 
services, holds rich promise for the future. For example, child welfare 
experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for 
substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully 
linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships. 
_SENTIMENT:_ Tension management and communication of sentiment 
are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment 
or feeling. One of the devices for tension management is preferential 
mating. The preferential mating of this particular population 
has been analyzed in a separate study. The relative geographical isolation 
of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating. 
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support 
for one another since it is not provided by the larger society. The 
supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and 
social isolation. The newlyweds building homes on the same land with 
either set of parents, and the almost exclusive use of members of the 
population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive 
relationship. As Loomis remarks, "In the internal pattern 
the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking, friendship, 
and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another 
and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic 
relations". _ACHIEVING:_ Maintenance of the <status 
quo> might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population 
today. Yet, the object of the element of achieving through the 
process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed 
by circumstances brought about by the war. Prior to World War 
/2, there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after 
World war /2,. _NORMS:_ The norms, as elements, refer 
to "all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual 
and group actions in any social system". The process of evaluation 
assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements. 
The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate 
selection in this population. From the evidence "it may be conjectured 
that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and 
females; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of 
permissive unions; and core-Negro marriages are proscribed for core 
members". _STATUS-ROLES:_ The element of status-roles and associated 
processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population 
to permit any type of conjectures about them. _POWER:_ 
There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members 
of the population that the element of power, primarily the voluntary 
influence of non-authoritative power, has been exerted on actors in 
the system, particularly in regard to mate selection. This would seem 
to vary from family to family, depending somewhat on the core or marginal 
"status" of that family. Again, size of the group may have 
some influence on the strength of group controls. _RANKING:_ Interviews 
with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in 
order 
to discover the ranking of the various families in the population. 
The large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the 
upper positions. Loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation 
process. "The standing or rank of an actor in a given social system 
is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in 
accordance with the norms and standards of the system". Despite the 
increasing rate of exogamous marriages, the population has been able 
to sustain, at least to some degree, the consciousness of its intermediate 
status in society. To some extent the system can be considered 
a <Gemeinschaft> in which "social-role occupancies are determined 
by birth, by attributes such as sex or caste, which are biologically 
or socially immutable". The adherence of many in the population to 
the Indian background in their pedigree, and emphasis upon the fact 
that their ancestors had never been slaves, becomes of prime interest 
in 
determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate 
status of the group in society. _SANCTIONS:_ The negative 
sanctions applied to core-Negro marriages for core members act as 
indicators of expected adherence to group norms. However, because of 
Church laws, lately more stringently enforced, which forbid the marriage 
of cousins closely related consanguineously, a means of facilitating 
the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate 
unions. A cursory survey of available material indicates a high 
rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous 
relationship. 

#SUBSYSTEMS#

The comprehensive or master 
processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system 
and subsystems. Within the larger social system are the structural 
and functional subsystems. The structural subsystem, consisting of 
relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts, includes: _1._ 
Subgroups of various types, interconnected by relational norms. 
_2._ Roles of various types, within the larger system and within 
the subgroups **h _3._ Regulative norms governing subgroups and 
roles. _4._ Cultural values.   In the study of marriage 
patterns for this group, consanguinity produces the structural system- 
a system of affinities- which, in turn, maintains the system of 
consanguinity. Subgroups of various types have been found within this 
system. Each family line can be considered a substructure. There seems 
to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status 
within the group. Additionally, the proscription of core-Negro marriages 
for core families, discussed above, would seem to act as a regulative 
norm governing subgroups and roles. The scope of this study does 
not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger 
system or within the subgroups. However, it cannot be presumed, informal 
though the structure of the population seems, that there are not 
well-defined roles within the system.   The present study relates 
to the theory of functional systems. It is hypothesized that fertility 
is a function of the social system when the population as a whole 
is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division 
of core families and marginal families is considered. The four 
functional problems of a social system are, to some extent, solved by 
the subsystems within this population. By means of geographical isolation 
and high fertility rates, inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern 
of isolation from the greater society maintained. In order to attain 
the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension, the high fertility 
rate provides more group members for mate selection, and the clustering 
of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls. To 
maintain their intermediate position in the larger society, it is not 
only necessary that members of this population be "visible", but 
that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate, distinct 
grouping or system in society. As mentioned above, where families 
are concentrated in larger numbers, group controls seem strongest and 
most effective. Adaptation to the social and non-social environment 
through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational 
segregation. This provides the necessary contact with the larger 
society, while supporting a type of control over members in terms 
of social contacts.   Integration "has to do with the inter-relation 
of parts". The problem of solidarity and morale again involves 
the concept of values. The values placed by the Brandywine population, 
upon maintaining a certain homogeneity, a certain separate racial 
identity, and therefore a certain separate social status, are important 
for the morale of the system. Since morale is closely related to 
pattern maintenance and integration, the higher the morale and solidarity, 
the better the system can solve the problems of the system. In this 
respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between 
the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within 
the same general locality, the greater the possibility for higher morale 
and solidarity within the Brandywine population. It is conceived 
that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical 
and social isolation. In turn, higher fertility rates for this population 
provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the 
population, allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity. 
The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger. 

#MASTER PROCESSES#

Of particular utility in the analysis of the 
development, persistence, and change of social systems has been the 
use of the master or comprehensive processes. Loomis considers six such 
processes in his paradigm.   1. Communication   2. Boundary 
maintenance   3. Systemic linkage   4. Socialization

5. Social control   6. Institutionalization Though undoubtedly 
all six processes are operative within the whole social system 
and its subsystems, two processes that are of crucial importance to 
this study will be singled out for particular emphasis: _COMMUNICATION:_ 
In discussing the process of communication, Loomis defines 
it as "the process by which information, decisions, and directives 
are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge, opinions, 
and attitudes are formed, or modified by interaction". Communication 
may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger 
community. Intense interaction is easier where segregated living and 
occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community, 
as in the case of this population. However, the factor of physical 
isolation is not a static situation. Although the Brandywine population 
is still predominantly rural, "there are indications of a consistent 
and a statistically significant trend away from the older and 
relatively isolated rural communities **h urbanization appears to be 
an important factor in the disintegration of this group. This conclusion 
is, however, an over-simplification. A more realistic analysis must 
take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe 
area are, in general, less segregated locally than group members 
in rural areas. In the urban area, in other words, they, unlike some 
urban ethnic groups, do not concentrate in ghetto colonies. Group pressures 
toward conformity are slight or non-existent, and deviant behavior 
in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions. In such a setting 
social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous, 
resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily, in mate selection 
behavior. To the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown 
of the group patterns of residential isolation, to that extent it 
contributes directly to increased exogamy". _SOCIAL CONTROL:_ 
The process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play 
a part in the individual's behavior, as well as the group's behavior. 
By means of this social control, deviance is either eliminated 
or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group. Examples 
from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned 
by ostracism from the group. _SOCIALIZATION:_ There is an oral 
tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin 
and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society. 
Confused and divided though this tradition may be, it is an important 
part of the social and cultural heritage of the group, and acts as a 
means of socialization, particularly for members of the rural community. 
The fact of Indian ancestry and "free" status during the days 
of slavery, are important distinctions made by members of the group. 
_BOUNDARY MAINTENANCE:_ "Culturally induced social cohesion resulting 
from common norms and values internalized by members of the group" 
is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well 
as in the process of socialization. The process of boundary maintenance 
identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems, and the characteristic 
interaction is maintained. As the threat of encroachment 
on the system increases, the "probability of applied boundary maintenance 
mechanisms increases".   The fertility rate pattern would 
seem to be a function, though a latent one, of the process of maintaining 
the boundary. "Increased boundary maintenance may be achieved, 
for example, by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities 
characteristic of the external pattern **h" The external pattern 
or external system can be considered as "group behavior that enables 
the group to survive in its environment **h" Boundary maintenance 
for 
this group would seem to be primarily social, as is the preference 
for endogamy. It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants 
in the matter of endogamy, particularly in rural areas. By their 
pattern of endogamy and exogamy, the core families and the marginal families 
show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain. 
_SYSTEMIC LINKAGE:_ Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries 
or limits of the group, systemic linkage is defined "as the 
process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems 
is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways 
and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit.

A royal decree issued in 1910, two years after the Belgian government 
assumed authority for the administration of the Congo, prescribed 
the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms. Further decrees 
along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919. In 1922 a continuous 
registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance 
of the Governor-General, and the periodic compilation of these 
records was ordered. But specific procedures for carrying out this 
plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors. A unified 
set of regulations, applicable to all areas, was issued in 1929, and 
a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was 
instituted at the same time. The whole system was again reviewed and 
reorganized in 1933. General responsibility for its administration rested 
with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor 
supply and native affairs, Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la 
Main-d'Oeuvre (~AIMO, **f Direction, **f Direction Generale, 
Gouvernement Generale). Tribal authorities, the chiefs and their 
secretaries, were held responsible for maintaining the registers of 
indigenous persons within their territories, under the general supervision 
of district officials. The district officials, along with their 
other duties, were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in 
selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic 
statistics.   The regulations require the inscription of each 
individual (male or female, adult or child) on a separate card (<fiche>). 
The cards, filed by <circonscription> (sub-chiefdom, or village), 
are kept in the headquarters of each <territoire> (chiefdom). Each 
card is expected to show certain information about the individual 
concerned, including his or her date of birth (or age at a specified 
time), spouses, and children. Additional entries must be made from time 
to time. Different cards are used for males and females, and a corner 
is clipped from the cards of adults, and of children when they reach 
puberty. So a quick count could be made at any time, even by an illiterate 
clerk, of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex 
classes. Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males 
on which tax payments, inoculations, periods of employment, and changes 
of residence are recorded. Similar identification cards were issued 
in 1959 to all adult females. Each adult is held personally responsible 
for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card 
which must be shown on demand. The registration card of a person leaving 
his home territory for a short period is put into a special file 
for absent persons. The cards of permanent out-migrants are, in theory, 
sent to an office in the place of new residence. Finally, the registration 
of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory 
in most regions.   Numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex 
classes were counted each year. In addition, demographic inquiries, 
supposedly involving field investigations, were conducted in selected 
minor divisions (<circonscriptions>) containing about 3 percent 
of the total population. The results of these inquiries were used to 
adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various 
ratios and rates by districts, including birth and death rates, general 
fertility rates, distributions by marital status, fertility of wives 
separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households, infant mortality, 
and migration. The areas to be examined in these inquiries were 
selected by local officials, supposedly as representative of a larger 
population. Averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas 
were applied to the larger population.   The scheme, in theory, 
is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions 
of African life. But it places a severe strain on the administrative 
resources (already burdened in other ways) of a widely dispersed, 
poor and largely illiterate population. The sampling program was 
instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely 
recognized in population studies. The system was not well adapted to 
conditions of life in urban centers. The distinction between domiciled 
(<de jure>) and present (<de facto>) population was not clearly 
defined. So the results are subject to considerable confusion. The 
system tended to break down during the war, but was reactivated; it 
had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951. In spite of the 
defects in this system, the figures on total population during the late 
1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual 
conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity. But the 
information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading.

The same system, with minor modifications, was developed in Ruanda-Urundi 
under Belgian administration. Here again it seems that 
useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the 
population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war 
periods.   Before considering more recent activities, we 
should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa. 
A number of strong independent agencies, established in some cases 
with governmental or royal support, have conducted large medical, social, 
educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo 
and Ruanda-Urundi. The work of Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance 
Medicale aux Indigenes du Congo Belge (~FOREAMI) 
has special interest with respect to demography. This agency accepted 
responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 
638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in 1956 in the Kwango District 
and adjacent areas east of Leopoldville. Each year from 1941 on, its 
medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine 
changes in population structure and vital rates and, as its primary 
objective, the incidence of major diseases. Its findings are reported 
each year in its <Rapport sur l'activite pendant annee> **h (Bruxelles). 
Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical 
officers in other areas. Other independent, or partially independent 
agencies, have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly 
related to demography. These studies vary widely in scope and precision. 
L'Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale 
(~IRSAC) has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has 
cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development 
of its official statistics.   A massive investigation 
of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in 
Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J& J& Maquet, former Director 
of the Social Science branch of ~IRSAC, now a professor 
at l'Universite Officielle du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi. 
Some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items (collected by sub-chiefs 
in 1,100 circumscriptions) have been tabulated. The results are 
now being analyzed.   Statistics have been recognized as a matter 
of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during 
the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs. 
The ~AIMO organizations of both countries, which maintain 
administrative services throughout the territories, retained immediate 
responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information. 
However, the statistical offices of both governments were 
assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics. 
A Bureau de la Demographie (A& Romaniuk, Director) was formed 
under ~AIMO in the Congo, to work in close rapport with the 
Section Statistique of the Secretariat General. Eventually responsibility 
for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to 
the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office. The 1952 
demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V& Neesen, 
a member of the ~IRSAC staff, though the inquiry was carried 
out under the auspices of ~AIMO, which has continuing responsibility 
for demographic statistics in this territory. A member of the 
~IRSAC staff (E& van de Walle) was recently delegated to cooperate 
with ~AIMO in the development of demographic statistics 
in this territory.   The initiation of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi 
(1952) and in the Congo (1955-57) were major advances. We 
will deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into 
operation later than the other.   The radical nature of the 
innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements. 
The term <enquetes demographiques>, previously used for the supplementary 
investigations carried out in connection with the administrative 
censuses, was used for the new investigations. However, the differences 
in procedure are fundamental. These are as follows: _(1) 
FIELD WORK PROCEDURES:_ Field operations were transferred from 
administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially 
trained teams 
of full-time African investigators (three teams, each working 
in two provinces). These teams carried out the same operations 
successively in different areas. _(2) NATURE OF THE SAMPLE:_ Sample 
areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application 
of the principles of probability theory, so as to be representative 
of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits. 
In short, scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective 
sampling. The populations of the various districts, or other major divisions, 
were stratified by type of community (rural, urban, mixed) and, 
where appropriate, by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy. Sample 
units (villages in rural areas, houses in cities) were drawn systematically 
within these strata. _(3) SIZE OF THE SAMPLE:_ Different 
sampling ratios were applied under different conditions. Higher 
proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural 
areas. About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new 
investigation, as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries. 
_(4) QUESTIONS AND DEFINITIONS:_ Uniform questions, definitions, 
and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country. Data 
were obtained, separately, on three classes of persons: (a) residents, 
present; (b) residents, absent; and (c) visitors. In the 
reports, summary results are given for both the <de facto> (a and c) 
and <de jure> (a and b) populations; but the subsequent analysis 
of characteristics is reported only for the <de jure> population (or, 
in some districts, only the <de facto> population).   These 
changes represent in effect, a shift from (1) an administrative compilation 
of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve 
political and economic objectives to (2) a systematic sampling census 
of the whole African population.   The population registration 
system still has important functions. It supplies local data which are 
useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive 
studies in particular situations. It provides a frame for the sampling 
census. It also provides a frame within which the registration 
of vital events is gradually gaining force (though one cannot expect to 
obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this 
source in the near future). It is still used in making current population 
estimates in post-census years, though the value of these estimates 
is open to question. Finally, it may have certain very important, 
less obvious values. Even though the registers may have an incomplete 
record of persons present in a particular area or include persons 
no longer living there, they contain precise information on ages, by date 
of birth, for some of the persons present (especially children in 
relatively stable communities) and supplementary information (such as 
records of marital status) for many others. The quality of the census 
data can, therefore, be greatly improved by the use of the registration 
records in conjunction with the field inquiries. Furthermore, it may 
be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method (as distinguished 
from sampling error) in each of these sources, on such subjects 
as fertility, mortality, and migration during a given interval by using 
information from two largely independent sources in conjunction.

The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year 
period, 1955-57; the results were still being processed in 1959. 
It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved 
equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960, so that the inquiry 
can be carried through in one year and the results published more 
expeditiously. It is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses 
be carried out at five-year intervals.   Reports already 
issued on the sampling census, 1955-57, in various areas run as follows 
(using only the French and omitting corresponding Flemish titles): 
@.   This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables.

Other reports in identical form, but with somewhat varying content, 
have been issued for: @.   These area reports will be 
followed, according to present plans, by a summary report, which will 
include a detailed statement on methods.

With this evidence in mind, the writer began to plan how he might 
more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes. 
Toward the end of the semester's work, he interviewed every 
married class member at great length. He found, as he had suspected, 
a 
general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed 
course was not really functional for these students. However, 
all admitted that the "hind sight" was not altogether lost. In their 
own words, it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they 
had gotten into their marriages, and perhaps they had obtained some 
insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time. In fact, 
they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design 
a section <exclusively> for married students there should be, at 
the beginning, some "hind sight" study; but they all hastened to 
add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent. 
All of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could 
be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course.

A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section 
for married students. As one of them expressed it, "It has done me 
a world of good to listen to the nai^ve questions and comments of 
these not-yet-married people. I can now better see just what processes 
provoked certain actions from me in the past. Had I been in an all-married 
section I would have missed this, and I believe that this single 
aspect has been of great personal value to me". This comment 
and others similar to it, would seem to indicate a possible justification 
for continuing the status quo. But the weight of feeling was heavily 
in the opposite direction. Thus, the writer decided to hold one experimental 
section of the functional preparation for marriage course 
in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married- 
that is, prerequisite: "marriage". This did not mean that married 
students could not enroll in other "mixed" sections, and some 
of them, largely because of scheduling difficulties, did. But only 
those already married could enroll in this one section. In addition, 
two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted. 1) 
The regular sections do not allow freshmen; this one did. This action 
was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that 
a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become 
sophomores. Many of them appear to drop out, for one reason or another. 
By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity 
for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get 
to take it. This has subsequently been verified by the experience. 2) 
Auditors were encouraged. In the regular sections they have always 
been more or less discouraged. The philosophy has been that if they could 
find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit 
and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively. 
Besides, auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight 
as regularly enrolled students. But in this one section we welcomed 
auditors. Why? For no particular reason, other than that the writer 
felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to be in attendance. 
Many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum, especially 
in the various engineering fields, with few electives till the senior 
year. Incidentally, it needs to be noted that because auditors were 
permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week, until 
at last it swelled to such proportions that this "free" auditing 
policy had to be retracted. After that, we began to get "visitors" 
to class.   This experimental class represented quite a variety 
of students. It ranged from a freshman woman, just married, through 
the various academic growth stages, including one senior-graduate student, 
to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also 
attended. It ranged from those with no children, through students 
in various stages of pregnancy, to one 44-year-old male with four children, 
three of whom were teenagers. It ranged from two women members 
who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married 
and seemingly unable to conceive.   One might digress at 
this point and speculate that if it is "wise" to create special sections 
for special status, then why not a special section for women pregnant 
before marriage, and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children, 
and so on. Some of these speculations may have some merit, others 
are somewhat ambiguous. But few who have experienced marriage can dispute 
the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different 
<in> marriage than in a pre-marital situation.   The writer 
began this special class by explaining his background thinking for 
creating such a section in the first place. He made it clear from the 
beginning that this was the students' opportunity, and that the future 
destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one. 
He <did> build a framework of academic "respectability", and one 
which did not encroach upon the "sacred sovereignty" of any other 
existing campus course. This is to say that this was not a course 
in wise buying or money spending methods, nor a course in how to raise 
children. We already have courses covering those problems, and so on. 
But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible. 
A steering committee of students was organized on the first day 
whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate 
the direction and <pace> the class was taking. The writer, being 
cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married 
students, did insist on there being included some "hind sight" material. 
But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around 
the attitudes "So we are married- now how do we make the best 
of it"? or "How do we <enrich> our already fine marriage"?

Films were used, as with all sections, but with one big difference. 
Our campus, unfortunately, owns no films. Since they are all 
either rented or borrowed, the requested dates for their use have to 
be far in advance. The writer never knew from week to week just where 
the section might be. For example, the steering committee might announce 
that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for 
an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched. Since 
the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning 
he had to go along with their decision- after, of course, pointing 
out 
whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one. Thus the 
films seen as they came in (coordinated for the regular sections), 
were often out of context. Nevertheless, the writer has never experienced 
such spontaneity of discussion after film showings.   Though 
it did not become known to the writer for some time, a nucleus group 
had sprung up within the class. They began to meet in the evenings and 
carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered 
in class. From a few students this group gradually increased to include 
over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class, and 
many outsiders as well. Also, although only a few of the students were 
intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning, most reported 
that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships 
were with members of that class. In fact, they often revamped 
their social activities to include class members previously unknown.

Supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the 
other sections, the major difference being that there was a noticeably 
<deeper level> in the reported outside reading by the married group. 
These students, although they might read various articles in popular 
magazines, more often chose to report on articles found in the journals. 
In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles, 
there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read. Whereas 
a high per cent of the regular students can be expected to read 
other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different 
direction, the married students chose whole books on specific areas 
and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest. Since 
the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered 
throughout the various sections previous to this experiment, 
nor, as a matter of fact, in those who were continuing in "single sections", 
he can only conclude that there must have been something "contagious" 
within the specific group which caused this to occur.

In the main, this course took the following directional high roads: 
1) A great deal of time was spent on <processes> for solving 
marital differences. This was not a search for a "magic formula", 
but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially 
to all types of communication in marriage. In short, it was centered 
around learning how to develop a <more sensitive empathy>. Not until 
the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further 
to 2) Specific adjustment areas, such as sex, in-laws, religion, 
finance, and so on. From here they proceeded to 3) These same areas 
in relation to their own future family life stages, developing these 
to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to 
confront them at some time or other.   As an example of this last 
facet, there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement. 
Mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of 
one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward, 
but the possible death of one's own spouse was not overlooked. Since 
the course, one member has lost her husband. This was not a particularly 
shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known to her 
that it might happen. But just when was an unknown, and of course the 
longer it did not happen, the stronger her wish and belief that it might 
not. Since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer 
on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were 
to her in this adjustment crisis.   Quite frequently class members 
brought questions from their mates at home. These were often carefully 
written out with a great deal of thought behind them. This added 
a personal zest to class discussions and participation.   Both 
sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage 
were extremely enlightening. The writer sensed a much freer and more 
frank discussion, especially of this one area, than ever before. He 
felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men 
in the class understood that orgasm, as a criterion, is not nearly so 
essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might 
think. This was probably much more meaningful because all the women 
in the class emphasized it time and again. On the other hand, the 
women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than 
have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males 
as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with 
love as most women seem to do.   in the reproductive area it could 
be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students 
had previously in "mixed" marital status sections. Perhaps this 
was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent. Never 
in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth 
discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various 
stages of pregnancy. There was a particularly marvelous opportunity 
for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented, 
from a childless couple to and including every trimester. 
In fact, we had one birth before the end of the course, and another student 
had to take the final examiantion a week early, just to be on the 
safe side. There was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester. 
Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference 
between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief 
"structuring" experience.   It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative 
subjects would adhere to more liberal, concretistic reports 
of what the ambiguous figure "looked like" as reflecting their 
hesitancy about taking chances. This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative 
subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people 
in action. Responses such as "rope with a loop in it", and "two 
pieces of rope", were quite characteristic. _GUILFORD-MARTIN 
PERSONALITY INVENTORIES._ The three personality inventories (Guilford 
~STDCR; Guilford-Martin ~GAMIN; Guilford-Martin 
~OAGCo), were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive 
subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects. These were the 
same subjects who were given the Rorschach test. Some predictions 
had been made concerning factors ~R, ~N, ~I and ~Co on these 
inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security 
aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as 
being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity.   Only 
~Co differentiated between the two groups at less that the 5% level 
(**f).   One prediction had been made about the difference 
in 
security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm 
reactivity when informed and those who did not. The nonreactors 
had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably 
"secure" nonreactors and "secure" reactors being used 
as the groups for comparative personality studies. It was predicted 
that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly 
from those who did not on the factor ~I which the investigators 
refer to as the "Inferiority" factor. All of the subjects 
in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups (as defined 
for purposes of the personality studies) were compared with those subjects 
who shifted in Conditions /3, or /4,. A ~t test on these 
two groups, shifters vs& nonshifters, gave a "~t" value of 2.405 
which 
is significant on the two-tail test at the .028 level. 

#DISCUSSION# 

_INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES_ Individual differences in Kohnstamm 
reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the 
subjects used in the study. Only 27% (11 subjects) gave a positive 
Kohnstamm reaction when completely nai^ve concerning the phenomenon. 
There were 49% (20 subjects) who did not give a positive reaction 
even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and 
had been given a demonstration. There were 24% (10 subjects) who 
shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured 
as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction.   Among 
this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind 
of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred. One subject 
changed when given only the information that some people have something 
happen to their arm when they relax. Five subjects (12%) did 
not change until they had been told that some people have something 
happen to their arm, what that something was, and also were given a 
demonstration. 
Four subjects (10%) did not change even then but needed 
the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances 
was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed 
while others did not. At no time was it implied by the experimenter 
that the subject's initial reaction was deviant. The subjects were 
only given information about <other possibilities of "normal" reaction>. 
Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai^ve state 
did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal 
people who did not react in this fashion. This information was accepted 
with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not 
show arm-levitation must be preventing it. These subjects implied that 
they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried. 
The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition /1, (the nai^ve 
state) is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility 
(if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal 
cues). In no way, either verbally or behaviorally, did the experimenter 
indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary 
contraction. Moreover, when the experimenter did inform those 
subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm 
rise once they relaxed, the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced 
in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation. They 
continued to give an arm-elevation. A differential suggestibility would 
have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information 
to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute 
their nai^ve Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion. Autosuggestibility, 
the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own 
expectations of the outcome (i&e&, that the arm-rise is a reaction 
to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction, because of his 
knowledge that "to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction") 
also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following 
reasons: (1) the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise 
when their arms rose, and (2) manifestations of the phenomenon despite 
anticipations of something else happening (e&g&, of becoming dizzy 
and maybe falling, an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one 
of the subjects).   A suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate 
as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they 
were informed of the possibilities of "normal" reactions different 
from those which they gave. While they were told that there were some 
normal people who reacted differently than they had, they were also informed 
that there were other normals who reacted as they had. There 
was no implication made that their initial reaction (absence of an arm-elevation) 
was less preferred than the presence of levitation. A more 
tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge 
and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible 
for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax, since any reaction 
seemed acceptable to the examiner as "normal".   The 
nai^ve state, Condition /1,, could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting 
one for 24% of the subjects in this study. They were not free 
to be themselves in this situation, an interpersonal one, where there 
was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable 
behavior. Instructions to relax, i&e&, to be "spontaneous", 
and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have, was not sufficiently 
reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions 
had been given. While other conditions might be even more effective 
in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm 
reactivity, it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would 
have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject 
which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of 
responsibility for his behavior.   Alcohol ingestion succeeded in 
changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject 
(the only one with whom this technique was tried). This subject, who 
has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years, did 
not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized 
conditions used in this experiment while sober. After two drinks 
containing alcohol, her arm flew upward very freely. There was evident 
delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of 
the freedom of movement. She described herself as having the same kind 
of "irresponsible" feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis. 
She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect 
they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which 
she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might 
seem appropriate to relax these controls.   Many subjects attributed 
differences 
in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective 
control- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived 
it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it. 
These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously 
when they were told that there were people who reacted differently 
than they had. The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid 
experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no 
control. They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention 
of control factors. They felt that they too could counteract 
the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced 
the reaction. Some of those who did not initially react with 
an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with 
control factors- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily. 
One subject spontaneously asked (after her arm had finally risen), "Do 
you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before"? Another 
said that her arm did not go up at first "because I wouldn't 
let it; I thought it wasn't supposed to". This subject was 
one 
who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai^ve state but 
not in the first. She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the 
first trial, but had consciously prevented it from so doing. She 
explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were "not letting 
themselves relax". When informed that there were some persons who 
did not have their arm go up, she commented, "I don't see how 
they can prevent it". In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation 
for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects, the 
Kohnstamm-negative 
subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis 
to explain nonreactivity. They felt that they were relaxing as much as 
they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent 
response must be on an unconscious level.   The above discussion 
does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in 
abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects; but rather that they could 
be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation. 
One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested 
in the nai^ve condition described her subjective experience as 
follows: "You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and 
it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's 
what's supposed to happen". She then described her experience as 
one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of 
being in which she relinquished control. However, she was able to relax 
and yield to the moment.   It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive 
subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are 
Kohnstamm-negative subjects; that they can give up their control and 
allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors. It is our belief 
that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the 
Kohnstamm-positive 
subjects in some of the other experimental situations 
to be discussed below. Thus, this readiness to relax controls, evidenced 
in the Kohnstamm situation, appears to be a more general personality 
factor. _ANISEIKONIC ILLUSION_ The Kohnstamm-positive subjects 
seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible 
in the external world. There was a significantly greater number 
in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while 
a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline. This 
occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going 
downhill. They knew that their perceptual experience differed from 
objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting 
on the aniseikonic lenses. Yet they were not so bound by past experience 
and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to 
be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be. The 
change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects, 
after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions, 
suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with 
their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations. They 
were able to experience at first, in terms of past conventionality. 
When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions, they 
were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present. It might 
be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong; 
that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as "threatening" 
until they are tested and proved otherwise.   While 
the interpretations that have been given are inferences only, they 
gain support from such comments as the following, which was made by one 
of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not, on the first trial, 
perceive the tilt illusion. 
_CONTROL OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS_ It would have been desirable for 
the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable 
being investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method. The 
structured schools were in an industrial city, with three-family tenement 
houses typical of the residential areas, but with one rather sizable 
section of middle-class homes. The unstructured schools were in 
a large suburban community, predominantly middle- to upper-middle class, 
but fringed by an industrial area. In order to equate the samples 
on socioeconomic status, we chose schools in both cities on the basis 
of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods. School principals and guidance 
workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research 
team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas. 
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from 
these data. Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from 
upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods. _SUBJECTS_ Individual 
differences in maturation and the development of readiness for 
learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most 
children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school 
achievement. Therefore, third-grade children were chosen as subjects 
for this study.   For purposes of sample selection only (individual 
tests were given later) we obtained group test scores of reading 
achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade 
population in each school system. The subjects for this study were 
randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution, one-third 
as underachievers, one-third medium, and one-third over-achievers. 
Children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation 
below the regression line of each total third-grade school population 
were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection. 
Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression 
line in their school system. The final sample was not significantly 
different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement 
or intelligence test scores. Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured 
schools furnished 156 cases, 87 boys and 69 girls. Eight classrooms 
in three structured schools furnished 72 cases, 36 boys and 36 
girls. Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size 
in the structured schools.   It was assumed that the sampling 
procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables 
under investigation. _RATING SCALE OF COMPULSIVITY_ An interview 
schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire 
were prepared, and one parent of each of the sample children was seen 
in the home. The parent was asked to describe the child's typical 
behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity 
to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self 
and others, irrational conformity to rules, orderliness, punctuality, 
and need for certainty. The interviewers were instructed not to suggest 
answers and, as much as possible, to record the parents' actual 
words as they described the child's behavior in home situations.

The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing 
the interview records, categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity, 
then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the 
case records. Final ratings were made on the basis of a point system 
which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors 
recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that 
was deviant from the discovered norms. Children scoring high in compulsivity 
were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations 
where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards 
and expectations, or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals. 
The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned 
about such matters. For instance, the following statement was rated 
low in compulsivity, "She's naturally quite neat about things, 
but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy. But she 
cleans it up very well when I remind her". _MEASUREMENT OF ANXIETY_ 
Castaneda, <et al>& revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for 
use with children. The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota 
Multiphastic Personality Inventory, with item selection based upon 
clinical definitions of anxiety. There is much research evidence to 
validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who 
are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees. Reliability and validation 
work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda, <et 
al>& demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with 
the adult scale. Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group 
testing device, in this study it was individually administered by psychologically 
trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children 
in reading the items. _RELATIONSHIP OF ANXIETY TO COMPULSIVITY_ 
The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with 
a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity. The two ratings yield a 
correlation of +.04, which is not significantly different from zero; 
therefore, we have measured two different characteristics. In theory, 
compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety, and one might expect 
a negative association except for the possibility that for many 
children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell 
the amount of anxiety they suffer. The issue of interaction between 
anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later. _CRITERION MEASUREMENT_ 
In the primary grades, reading permeates almost every aspect of 
school progress, and the children's early experiences of success or 
failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement 
that is relatively enduring throughout the following years. In establishing 
criterion measurements, it was therefore thought best to broaden 
the scope beyond the reading act itself. The predicted interaction 
effect should, if potent, extend its influence over all academic achievement.

The Stanford Achievement Test, Form ~J, was administered 
by classroom teachers, consisting of a battery of six sub-tests: 
Paragraph Meaning, Word Meaning, Spelling, Language, Arithmetic 
Computation, and Arithmetic Reasoning. All of these sub-tests 
involve reading except Arithmetic Computation. Scores are stated 
in grade-equivalents on a national norm. The battery median grade-equivalent 
was used in data analysis in this study.   The Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children was administered to each sample 
third-grade child by a clinical worker. The relationship of intelligence 
test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact (in this 
case, **f); therefore, in the investigation of the present hypothesis, 
it was necessary to control this factor.   The criterion score 
used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement. 
It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement 
test score and the score that would be predicted by the I&Q&. 
For example, on the basis of the regression equation, a child with 
an I&Q& of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement 
test score of 4.8 (grade equivalent). If a child with an I&Q& 
of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement, his discrepancy score would be 
+.7, representing .7 of one year of over-achievement. A child with an 
I&Q& of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score 
of 3.5. If such a child scored 3.0, his discrepancy score would be -.5, 
representing .5 of one year of under-achievement. In this manner, 
the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled, allowing 
discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting 
from other variables. 

#RESULTS#

_TEST OF INTERACTION OF COMPULSIVITY 
AND TEACHING METHODS_ Tables 1 and 2 present the results of 
the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the 
descriptive variable. Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of 
each sub-group graphically. First of all, as we had surmised, the highly 
compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly 
better (**f) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured 
schools. It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity 
within the structured schools, the high compulsive children do 
better (**f). No significant difference was found in achievement between 
high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school. The 
hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching 
method was supported, in this case, at the .05 level.   While 
we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school 
setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured, 
we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives 
within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning 
reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives. Indeed 
their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis 
although the difference was not significant. We speculate that compulsives 
in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of 
the lack of systemization in their school setting, but that their need 
to organize (for comfort) is so intense that they struggle to induce 
the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the 
environment.   It is interesting to note that medium compulsives 
in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores (although 
not significantly lower). Possibly their compulsivity was not strong 
enough to cause them to build their own structure.   Our conjecture 
is, then, that regardless of the manner in which school lessons 
are taught, the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each 
lesson that aid him in systematizing his work. When helped by a high 
degree of structure in lesson presentation, then, and only then, does 
such a child attain unusual success. _TEST OF INTERACTION OF ANXIETY 
AND TEACHING METHODS_ The statistical analyses of achievement in 
relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the 
two are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Figure 2 is a graph of the mean 
achievement scores of each group. As predicted, the highly anxious children 
in the unstructured schools score more poorly (**f) than those 
in 
the structured schools. The interaction effect, which is significant 
at the .01 level, can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores. While 
high anxiety children achieve significantly less well (**f) in the 
unstructured school than do low anxiety children, they appear to do at 
least as well as the average in the structured classroom.   The 
most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement 
in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured 
schools. According to the theory proposed, this is a consequence 
of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated 
for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment. The 
fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is 
thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or 
under-achievement 
these children exhibit. The child with high anxiety may 
first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement, but because 
his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and 
memorization of complex symbols, the child may fail in his initial attempts 
to master the problem. Failure confirms the threat, and the intensity 
of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more 
difficult, so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the 
decrement in performance is pronounced.   The individual with high 
anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task 
with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination. But 
the symbols he is asked to learn are simple. As shown earlier, the 
highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple 
elements. Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of 
discrimination are improved. By the time the child first attacks the 
actual problem of reading, he is completely familiar and at ease with 
all of the elements of words. Apparently academic challenge in the structured 
setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high 
anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state 
without becoming confused or panicked.   Sarason <et al>& 
present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like 
situation, and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives 
supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher. Although the 
present study was not a direct replication of their investigations, the 
results do not confirm their conclusion. Observers, in the two school 
systems studied here, judged the teachers in the structured schools 
to be more impersonal and demanding, while the atmosphere in the 
unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting. 
Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only 
in the unstructured school, and performed as well or better than average 
in the structured setting. 
_ANALYSIS_ Analysis means the evaluation of subparts, the comparative 
ratings of parts, the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements. 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding 
strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to 
eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts. _IMPERSONAL PURPOSES_ 
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms 
of individuals. Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose: 
to evaluate procedures, regardless of individuals. For example: 
a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying. 
_EXAMPLES_ Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones 
we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation 
and analysis. One should keep in mind that many of the exciting 
possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been 
used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other 
areas. _EVALUATION_ The president of a small firm selling restaurant 
products, had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen 
for his business. Interviewing, checking references, training the 
salesmen, having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive- 
and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory 
performance was too high. It was his experience that only one good salesman 
was found out of every seven hired- and only one was hired out 
of every seven interviewed.   Roleplaying was offered as a solution- 
and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited 
to a hotel conference room, where the president explained the difficulty 
he had, and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who 
just did not work out. In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires, 
checking their references, interviewing them, asking them to 
be tried out, he told them he would prefer to test them. Each person 
was to enter the testing room, carrying a suitcase of samples. Each salesman 
was to read a sheet containing a description of the product. In 
the testing room he was to make, successively, three presentations 
to three different people.   In the testing room, three of the veteran 
salesmen served as antagonists. One handled the salesman in a 
friendly manner, another in a rough manner, and the third in a hesitating 
manner. Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it. The 
antagonists came in, one at a time, and did not see or hear the other 
presentations. After each presentation, the antagonist wrote his judgment 
of the salesmen; and so did the observers consisting of the 
president, three of his salesmen and a psychologist.   Ten salesmen 
were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon. This procedure 
was repeated one day a month for four months. The batting average 
of one success out of seven increased to one out of three. The president 
of the firm, calculating expenses alone, felt his costs had dropped 
one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred 
per cent.   The reason for the value of this procedure was simply 
that the applicants were tested "at work" in different situations 
by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen 
conducted themselves with different, but typical restaurant owners 
and managers. They were, in a sense, "tried out" in realistic situations.

From the point of view of the applicants, less time 
was wasted in being evaluated- and they got a meal out of it as well 
as some insights into their performances.   Another use of roleplaying 
for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in 
real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during 
the daily course of work.   The position of receptionist was 
opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other 
girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher 
prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions. 
All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist. 
At the end of work one day, the personnel man took the applicants 
one at a time, asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk 
and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to 
the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes. 
Each girl was independently "tested" by the personnel man, and 
he served not only as the director, but as the antagonist and the observer.

Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl, whom 
he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat 
mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time, did 
the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist, showing 
wit, sparkle, and aplomb. She was hired and was found to be entirely 
satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day. _ANALYSIS_ 
In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area, 
since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision 
but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen 
in dynamic functioning. Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying 
for analysis may help explain the procedure.   An engineer 
had been made the works manager of a firm, supplanting a retired employee 
who had been considered outstandingly successful. The engineer had 
more than seven years of experience in the firm, was well trained, was 
considered a hard worker, was respected by his fellow engineers for 
his technical competence and was regarded as a "comer". However, 
he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position. He seemed 
to antagonize everyone. Turnover rates of personnel went up, production 
dropped, and morale was visibly reduced. Despite the fact that he 
was regarded as an outstanding engineer, he seemed to be a very poor 
administrator, although no one quite knew what was wrong with him. At 
the insistence of his own supervisor- the president of the firm, he 
enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders.   He played 
a number of typical situations before observers, other supervisors who 
kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought 
was wrong. Entirely concerned with efficiency, he was merciless in 
criticizing people who made mistakes, condemning them to too great an 
extent. He did not really listen to others, had little interest in their 
ideas, and wanted to have his own way- which was the only right 
way. The entire group of managers explained, in great detail, a number 
of human relations errors that he made.   One by one, these 
errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors. 
He admitted his behavior, and defended it. He refused to change 
his approach, and instead he attacked high and low- the officials for 
their not backing him, and subordinates for their laxness, stupidity, 
and stubbornness. After the diagnosing, he left the course, convinced 
that it could do him no good.   We may say that his problem 
was diagnosed but that he refused treatment. The engineer turned works 
manager had a particular view of life- and refused to change it. We 
may say that his attitude was foolish, since he may have been a success 
had he learned some human relations skills; or we may say that 
his attitude was commendable, showing his independence of mind, in his 
refusal to adjust to the opinions of others. In any case, he refused 
to accept the implications of the analysis, that he needed to be made 
over.   Another case may be given in illustration of a successful 
use of analysis, and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive 
analysis. In a course for supermarket operators, a district manager 
who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly 
successful as a store manager, found that in supervising other 
managers he was having a difficult time. On playing some typical situations 
before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated 
as unsatisfactory. He was told he displayed, for example, a sense 
of superiority- and he answered: "Well, I am supposed to know 
all the answers, aren't I"? He was criticized for his curtness 
and abruptness- and he answered: "I am not working to become 
popular". On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior- he answered: 
"I have to make decisions. That's my job". In short, 
as frequently happens in analyses, the individual feels threatened and 
defends himself. However, in this case the district manager was led 
to see the errors of his ways. The necessary step between diagnosis and 
training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms. How this 
was accomplished may be described, since this sometimes is a crucial 
problem.   The director helped tailor-make a check list of the district 
manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences 
commenting on the mistakes they felt he made. These errors were 
then collected and written on a blackboard, condensing similar ideas. 
Eighteen errors were located, and then the director asked each individual 
to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the 
particular errors. They were asked to vote "true" if they thought 
they had seen him make the error, "false" if they thought he had 
not; and "cannot say" if they were not certain.   The manager 
sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went 
up, and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard. No comments 
were made during the voting. The results looked as follows: **f.

The first eight of these eighteen statements, which received 
at least one-half of the votes, were duplicated to form an analysis 
checklist for the particular manager, and when this particular manager 
roleplayed in other situations, the members checked any items that appeared. 
To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself 
only during the sessions, they were rather lengthy (about twenty minutes), 
the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that 
he would not know what to expect, new antagonists were brought on the 
scene unexpectedly, and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately 
behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in 
a manner for which he had been previously criticized.   After 
every session, the check marks were totaled up and graphed, and in this 
way the supervisor's progress was charted. _SUMMARY_ In life 
we learn to play our roles and we "freeze" into patterns which become 
so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do. We can see 
others more clearly than we can see ourselves, and others can see us 
better than we see ourselves. To learn what we do is the first step 
for improvement. To accept the validity of the judgments of others is 
the second step. To want to change is the third step. To practice new 
procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the 
fourth step. To use these new ways in daily life is the last step. 
Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to 
training.   When an evaluative situation is set up, and no concern 
is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate, we say that 
roleplaying is used for evaluation. Observers can see a person engaged 
in spontaneous behavior, and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion. 
This behavior is more "veridical"- or true than other 
testing behavior for some types of evaluation, and so can give quick and 
accurate estimates of complex functioning.   While roleplaying 
for testing is not too well understood at the present time, it represents 
one of the major uses of this procedure. 

#CHAPTER /10, SPONTANEITY 
TRAINING#

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS CHAPTER is to clarify 
the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts. 
In addition, the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will 
be reviewed. The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated 
rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this 
unique training area. The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying 
application from the previous discussion of training are twofold: 
_1._ Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new.

It is not easy for the therapist to discern when, in the patient's 
communicating, an introject has appeared and is holding sway. One 
learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone- to his voice's 
suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one, a quality 
which sounds somehow artificial or, in some instances, parrotlike. The 
content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition, as 
if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove; only seldom is it so 
simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom, 
common to our culture, which he has evidently heard, over and over, 
from a parent until he experiences it as part of him.   One hebephrenic 
woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow 
phony experience of pseudo-emotion, during which, despite her wracking 
sobs and streaming cheeks, I felt only a cold annoyance with her. 
Eventually such incidents became more sporadic, and more sharply demarcated 
from her day-after-day behavior, and in one particular session, 
after several minutes of such behavior- which, as usual, went on 
without any accompanying words from her- she asked, eagerly, "Did 
you see Granny"? At first I did not know what she meant; I 
thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from 
seeing 
her grandmother, in their distant home-city. Then I realized that 
she had been deliberately showing me, this time, what Granny was like; 
and when I replied in this spirit, she corroborated my hunch.

At another phase in the therapy, when a pathogenic mother-introject 
began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene, she muttered 
in a low but intense voice, to herself, "I hate that woman inside 
me"! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this; 
but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room 
from me, looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory 
tone, "Your 
father despises you"! Again, I at first misconstrued 
this disconcertingly intense communication, and I quickly cast 
through my mind to account for her being able to speak, with such utter 
conviction, of an opinion held by my father, now several years deceased. 
Then I replied, coldly, "If you despise me, why don't you 
say so, directly"? She looked confused at this, and I felt sure 
it had been a wrong response for me to make. It then occurred to me to 
ask, "Is that what that woman told you"? She clearly agreed 
that this had been the case. I realized, now, that she had been showing 
me, in what impressed me as being a very accurate way, something her 
mother had once said to her; it was as if she was showing me one of 
the reasons why she hated that woman inside her. What had been an unmanageably 
powerful introject was now, despite its continuing charge 
of energy disconcerting to me, sufficiently within control of her ego 
that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like.

Earlier, this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety 
of introjects that at times, when she was in her room alone, it would 
sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in 
the room, as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice. A somewhat 
less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine, who used to often seclude 
herself in her room, often sounded through the closed door- as I 
would find on passing by, between our sessions- for all the world 
like two persons, a scolding mother and a defensive child.   Particularly 
hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which 
the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the 
therapist, some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself 
only poorly aware, and the recognition of which, as a part of himself, 
he finds distinctly unwelcome. I have found, time and again, that 
some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part 
of a patient rests, in the final analysis, on this basis; and only 
when I can acknowledge this, to myself, as being indeed an aspect of 
my personality, does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of 
the patient's behavior. For example, one hebephrenic man used to 
annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and 
made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the 
following day, or whenever, "You're welcome", in a notably condescending 
fashion- as though it were his due for me to thank him 
for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing 
up my failure to utter a humbly grateful, "thank you" to him 
at the end of each session. Eventually it became clear to me, partly 
with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my 
condescension to me somewhat more directly, that this man, with his 
condescending, 
"You're welcome", was very accurately personifying 
an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own 
demeanor, over these months, on each of these occasions when I had 
bid him good-bye with the consoling note, each time, that the healing 
Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered 
again on the morrow.   Another patient, a paranoid woman, for many 
months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow 
patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building, 
as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met. 
This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the 
uncomfortably close similarity between, on the one hand, her arranging 
the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking, or turning 
the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others, 
and on the other hand, my own coming stolidly into her room despite 
her persistent and vociferous objections, bringing my big easy chair 
with me, usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred 
to keep in a very cold state, and plunking myself down in my chair- 
in short, behaving as if I owned her room. 

#4. CONDENSATION:# 

Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated, or reduced, 
in their communicative expression, to some comparatively simple-seeming 
verbal or nonverbal statement.   One finds, for example, 
that a terse and stereotyped 
verbal expression, seeming at first to be 
a mere hollow convention, reveals itself over the months of therapy 
as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings, and 
the most unconventional of meanings. More than anything, it is the 
therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype 
which helps these meanings to become revealed, something like a spread-out 
deck of cards, on sporadic occasions over the passage of the 
patient's and his months of work together. one cannot assume, of course, 
that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype 
at the beginning of the therapy, or at any one time later on when 
the stereotype was uttered; probably it is correct to think of it as 
a matter of a well-grooved, stereotyped mode of expression- and no, 
or but a few, other communicational grooves, as yet- being <there>, 
available for the patient's use, as newly-emerging emotions and 
ideas well up in him over the course of months. But it is true that the 
therapist can sense, when he hears this stereotype, that there are 
at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it, a blurred babel 
of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from 
one another.   Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype- a 
"How are you now"? or an "I want to go home", or whatever- 
but a nonverbal one which reveals itself, gradually, as the condensed 
expression of more than one latent meaning. A hebephrenic man used 
to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his 
largely-silent 
hours with his therapist. When the therapist came to feel 
on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him, "What is that, 
Bill- hello or farewell"?, the patient replied, "Both, Dearie- 
two in one".   Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression, 
that which seems best to give release, and communicational expression, 
to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter. It is 
no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient, the most severely dedifferentiated 
of all schizophrenic patients, shows, as one of his characteristic 
symptoms, laughter- laughter which now makes one feel scorned 
or hated, which now makes one feel like weeping, or which now gives 
one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair; and 
which, more often than all these, conveys a <welter> of feelings which 
could in no way be 
conveyed by any number of words, words which are so 
unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another. To 
a much less full extent, the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus 
has a comparable communicative function; in working with these patients 
the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling 
over of the possible meaning of a belch, or the passage of flatus, 
not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze, 
but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute 
forms of communication in which, from time to time, quite different 
things are being said, long before the patient can become sufficiently 
aware of these, as distinct feelings and concepts, to say them 
in words.   As I have been intimating, in the schizophrenic- 
and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this is a question 
which I have no wish to take up- condensation is a phenomenon in which 
one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas 
which are, at an unconscious level, well sorted out, but rather a condensed 
expression of feelings and ideas which, even in the unconscious, 
have yet to become well differentiated from one another. Freeman, 
Cameron and McGhie, in their description of the disturbances of thinking 
found in chronic schizophrenic patients, say, in regard to condensation, 
that "**h the lack of adequate discrimination between the 
self and the environment, and the objects contained therein **h in itself 
is the prototypical condensation".   In my experience, a 
great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are 
so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated 
from figurative meanings in his subjective experience. Thus he may 
be referring to some concrete thing, or incident, in his immediate environment 
by some symbolic-sounding, hyperbolic reference to transcendental 
events on the global scene. Recently, for example, a paranoid woman's 
large-scale philosophizing, in the session, about the intrusive 
curiosity which has become, in her opinion, a deplorable characteristic 
of mid-twentieth-century human culture, developed itself, before the 
end of the session, into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking 
at her partially exposed breast, as indeed I was. Or, equally 
often, a concretistic-seeming, particularistic-seeming statement may consist, 
with its mundane exterior, in a form of poetry- may be full 
of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression: 
a metaphor, a smile, an allegory, or some other symbolic mode of speaking.

Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is, more often 
than not, entirely unaware. His subjective experience may be a remarkably 
concretistic one. One hebephrenic women confided to me, "I 
live in a world of words", as if, to her, words were fully concrete 
objects; Burnham, in his excellent article (1955) concerning schizophrenic 
communication, includes mention of similar clinical material. 
A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various 
theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding, in a most articulate 
fashion, during session after session with me, were like great 
cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him; as he 
spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung, high 
in the air, from a docked steamship.

The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary 
information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's 
contents around prefixes, stems, suffixes, etc&. A significant 
reduction 
in the voume of store information is thus realized, especially 
for a highly inflected language such as Russian. For English the reduction 
in size is less striking. This approach requires that: (1) 
each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence 
between the occurrence and dictionary entries, and (2) the information 
retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized 
into a description of the particular word. The logical scheme used 
to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in 
the dictionary file. Implementation of the latter requires storage of 
information needed only for synthesis.   We suggest the application 
of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem. 
But first, we must define two terms so that their meaning will be 
clearly understood: _1._ <form>- any unique sequence of alphabetic 
characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed 
by a space. _2._ <occurrence>- an instance of a form in text.

We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information 
required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information 
directly to the occurrences in text. We accomplish this by compiling 
a list of text forms as text is read by the computer. A random-storage 
scheme, based on the spelling of forms, provides an economical 
way to compile this text-form list. Dictionary forms found to match 
forms in the text list are marked. A location in the computer store 
is also named for each marked form; dictionary information about the 
form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences 
of the form in text. Finally, information is retrieved from the dictionary 
as required by stages of the translation process- the grammatic 
description for sentence-structure determination, equivalent-choice 
information for semantic analysis, and target-language equivalents 
for output construction.   The dictionary is a form dictionary, 
at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching 
text occurrences with dictionary entries. Also, the dictionary 
is divided into at least two parts: the list of dictionary forms and 
the file of information that pertains to these forms. A more detailed 
description of dictionary operations- text lookup and dictionary 
modification- give a clearer picture.   Text lookup, as we will 
describe it, consists of three steps. The first is compiling a list 
of text forms, assigning an information cell to each, and replacing text 
occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each 
occurrence. For this step the computer memory is separated into three 
regions: cells in the ~W-region are used for storage of the forms 
in the text-form list; cells in the ~X-region and ~Y region 
are reserved as information cells for text forms.   When an occurrence 
**f is isolated during text reading, a random memory address **f, 
the address of a cell in the ~X-region, is computed from the form 
of **f. Let **f denote the form of **f. If cell **f has not previously 
been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form 
list, it is now assigned as the information cell of **f. The form itself 
is stored in the next available cells of the ~W-region, beginning 
in cell **f. The address **f and the number of cells required to 
store the form are written in **f; the information cell **f is saved 
to represent the text occurrence. Text reading continues with the next 
occurrence.   Let us assume that **f is identical to the form 
of an occurrence **f which preceded **f in the text. When this situation 
exists, the address **f will equal **f which was produced from **f. 
If **f was assigned as the information cell for **f, the routine can 
detect that **f is identical to **f by comparing **f with the form 
stored at location **f. The address **f is stored in the cell **f. When, 
as in this case, the two forms match, the address **f is saved to 
represent the occurrence **f. Text reading continues with the next 
occurrence.

A third situation is possible. The formula for computing 
random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a 
distinct address for each distinct form. Thus, when more than one distinct 
form leads to a particular cell in the ~X-region, a chain of 
information cells must be created to accommodate the forms, one cell 
in the chain for each form. If **f leads to an address **f that is equal 
to the address computed from **f, even though **f does not match **f, 
the chain of information cells is extended from **f by storing the 
address of the next available cell in the ~Y-region, **f, in **f. 
The 
cell **f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned 
as the information cell of **f. A third cell can be added by storing 
the address of another ~Y-cell in **f; similarly, as many cells 
are added as are required. Each information cell in the chain contains 
the address of the ~Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned 
is stored. Each cell except the last in the chain also contains 
the address of the ~Y-cell that is the next element of the chain; 
the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the 
chain. Hence, when the address **f is computed from **f, the cell **f 
and 
all ~Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether 
**f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form 
list and the chain. When the information cell for **f has been determined, 
it is saved as a representation of **f. Text reading continues 
with the next occurrence.   Text reading is terminated when 
a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list. 
This initiates the second step of glossary lookup- connecting the 
information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms. 
Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form 
list. Each time a dictionary form matches a text form, the information 
cell of the matching text form is saved. The number of dictionary 
forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved. These two pieces 
of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text 
form constitute the table of dictionary usage. If each text form is 
marked when matched with a dictionary form, the text forms not contained 
in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have 
been read. The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken 
at that time.   Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form 
list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in 
the form list during text reading. A random address **f that lies within 
the ~X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the 
~i-th dictionary form. If cell **f is an information cell, it and 
any information cells in the ~Y-region that have been linked to **f 
each contain an address in the ~W-region where a potentially matching 
form is stored. The dictionary form is compared with each of these 
text forms. When a match is found, an entry is made in the table of 
dictionary usage. If cell **f is not an information cell we conclude 
that the ~i-th dictionary form is not in the text list.   These 
two steps essentially complete the lookup operation. The final step 
merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information 
that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list, and 
uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach 
the appropriate information to each occurrence in text. The list of 
text forms in the ~W-region of memory and the contents of the information 
cells in the ~X and ~Y-regions are no longer required. Only 
the assignment of the information cells is important.   The 
first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis 
of the input text. The grammatical description of each occurrence in 
the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis. 
A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any 
type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached 
to each text occurrence.   The grammatic descriptions of all forms 
in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary 
file. The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe. 
When entries are being retrieved from this file, the table of dictionary 
usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store 
in the computer. This selection-rejection process takes place as the 
file is read. Each entry that is selected for storage is written into 
the next available cells of the ~W-region. The address of the 
first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information 
cell for the form. (The address of the information cell is also supplied 
by the table of dictionary usage.) When the complete file has been 
read, the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary 
have been stored in the ~W-region; the information cell assigned 
to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description 
of the form it represents. Hence, the description of each text 
occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell 
addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information 
cell for each occurrence.   The only requirements on 
dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each 
form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form 
list and that information for each form be available in a sequence 
identical with the sequence of the forms. This leaves the ordering 
of entries variable. (Here an entry is a form plus the information 
that pertains to it.)   Two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary 
are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms 
rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more 
than one dictionary form. The former is intended to decrease the amount 
of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage. The latter is useful 
for modifying information about some or all forms of a word, hence 
reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents. Applying 
the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from 
a representative form and its classification, we can add all forms of 
a word to the dictionary at once. An extension of the principle would 
permit entering a grammatic description of each form. Equivalents could 
be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the 
dictionary or after the word has been studied in context. Thus, one can 
think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form.   If 
all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary, 
a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible. 
For example, the inflected forms of a word can be represented, 
insofar as regular inflection allows, by a stem and a set of endings to 
be attached. (Indeed, the set of endings can be replaced by the <name> 
of a set of endings.) The full forms can be derived from such information 
just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list. 
Similarly, if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary, the 
equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they 
apply 
to each form. The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon 
such summarization or designed around it. When irregularity and variation 
prevent summarizing, information is written in complete detail. Entries 
are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information 
retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary 
operations is decreased. 
In sentences, patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations 
of influences that can only be suggested here. The tendency is toward 
putting dominant stress at the end. There is a parallel to this tendency 
in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes. Thus the 
first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows. 
"A charge to keep I have, A God to glorify". In the 
tune to which this hymn is most often sung, "Boylston", the syllables 
<have> and <fy>, ending their lines, have twice the time any 
other syllables have. Dominant stress is of course more than extended 
duration, and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress 
or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of 
were spoken alone: a dominant stress given to <glorify> would normally 
center on its first syllable rather than its last. But the parallel 
is significant. When the answer to <what's wrong now?> is <Bill's 
broken a chair>, dominant stress will usually be on the complement 
<a chair>. From the point of view of syntactic analysis the 
head word in the statement is the predicator <has broken>, and from 
the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers 
in the breaking; but dominant stress will be assigned to <broken> 
only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence. In <I know one 
thing> dominant stress will usually be on the complement <one thing>; 
in <one thing I know> it will usually be on the predicator <know>. 
In <small-town people are very friendly> dominant stress will 
generally be on the complement <very friendly>; in the double sentence 
<the smaller the town, the friendlier the people> it will generally 
be on the subjects <the town> and <the people>. In <what's 
a linguist?> dominant stress will generally be on the subject 
<a linguist>; in <who's a linguist?> it will generally be on 
the complement <a linguist>. Dominant stress is on <her luggage> 
both in <that's her luggage>, where <her luggage> is the complement, 
and in <there's her luggage>, where it is the subject. Adverbial 
second complements, however, are likely not to have dominant stress 
when they terminate sentences. If the answer to <what was that noise?> 
is <George put the cat out>, dominant stress will ordinarily 
be on the first complement, <the cat>, not the second complement 
<out>. Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress. If the 
answer to <what was that noise?> is <George reads the news emotionally>, 
dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct <emotionally>. 
When prepositional complements are divided as in <what are you 
looking for?> they are likely to lose dominant stress.   Context 
is of extreme importance. What is new in the context is likely 
to be made more prominent than what is not. Thus in a context in which 
there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is 
new, dominant stress will probably be on <here> in <it rarely snows 
here>, but in a context in which there has been discussion of local 
weather but no mention of snow, dominant stress will probably be on <snows>. 
The personal pronouns and substitute <one> are normally unstressed 
because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context. 
In <I'll go with George> dominant stress is probably on <George>; 
but if George has just been mentioned prominently (and 
the trip to be made has been under discussion), what is said is probably 
<I'll go with him>, and dominant stress is probably on the preposition 
<with>. When a gesture accompanies <who's he?> the personal 
pronoun has dominant stress because "he" has not been mentioned 
previously. If both George and a piece of information George 
does not have are prominent in the context, but the idea of telling George 
is new, then dominant stress will probably be on <tell> in <why 
not tell George?> But when what is new in a particular context 
is also fairly obvious, there is normally only light stress or no stress 
at all. Thus the unstressed <it> of <it rarely snows here> gets 
its significance from its use with <snows>: nothing can snow snow 
but "it". In <there aren't many young people in the neighborhood> 
the modifier <young> takes dominant stress away from its head 
<people>: the fact that the young creatures of interest are people 
seems rather obvious. If <women> replaced <people>, it would normally 
have dominant stress. In <I have things to do> the word <things> 
makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress 
than <do>. If <work> is substituted for <things> (with more 
exact contribution to meaning), it will have dominant stress. In <I 
know one thing> dominant stress is likely to go to <one> rather than 
to semantically pale <thing>. In <I knew you when you were a child, 
and you were pretty then> dominant stress on <then> implies that 
the young woman spoken to is still pretty. Dominant stress on <pretty> 
would be almost insulting here. In the written language <then> 
can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here, but much 
of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness, 
and a careless reader will have to back up and reread. 
Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion. 
Thus in <it's incredible what that boy can eat> dominant stress 
is likely to be on <incredible>, and <eat> will have strong 
stress also. In <she has it in for George> dominant stress will ordinarily 
be on <in>, where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to 
center. In <we're painting at our garage> strong stress on <at> 
indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an 
effort at painting. Where there is comparison or contrast dominant 
stresses normally operate to center attention. Thus in <his friends 
are stranger than his sisters'> strong stresses are normal for <his> 
and <sisters'>, but in <his friends are stranger than his sisters> 
strong stresses are normal for <friends> and <sisters>. In 
<he's hurting himself more than he's hurting you> both <himself> 
and <you> have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if 
there were no contrast. In <is she Chinese or Japanese?> the 
desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last 
components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns 
of stress of <Chinese> and <Japanese>. Sometimes strong stress 
serves to focus an important secondary relationship. Thus in <Mary 
wrote an account of the trip first> strong stress on <Mary> marks 
Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip, 
strong stress on <wrote> marks the writing as the first of a series 
of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip (about 
which she may later have made speeches, for example), and strong stress 
on <trip> makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about 
which Mary wrote accounts. In <hunger stimulates man too> the situation 
is very similar. Strong stress on <hunger> treats hunger as 
an additional stimulus, strong stress on <stimulates> treats stimulation 
as an additional effect of hunger, strong stress on <man> treats 
man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger. 
Here again, in the written language it is possible to help the 
reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics, but much 
of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light 
of context.   When a word represents a larger construction of 
which it is the only expressed part, it normally has more stress than 
it would have in fully expressed construction. Thus when <yes, I 
have> is the response to <have you finished reading the paper?> 
the stress on <have>, which here represents <have finished reading 
the paper>, is quite strong. In <Mack's the leader at camp, but 
Jack is here> the <is> of the second main declarative represents 
<is the leader> and therefore has stress. <Mack's the leader at 
camp, but Jack's here>, with this <is> deprived of stress, makes 
<here> the complement in the clause. In <of all the suggestions that 
were made, his was the silliest> the possessive <his> represents 
<his suggestion> and is stressed. When <go> represents itself and 
a complement (being equivalent, say, to <go to Martinique>) in <which 
boat did Jack go on?> it has strong stress; when it represents 
only itself and <on which> is its complement (so that <go on> 
is semantically equivalent to <board>), <on> has stronger stress 
than <go> does. Omission of a subordinator pronoun, however, does 
not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which 
the subordinator pronoun would be object. Thus <to> has light stress 
both in <that was the conclusion that I came to> and in <that 
was the conclusion I came to>. But when <to> represents <to consciousness> 
in <that was the moment that I came to>, and similarly 
in <that was the moment I came to>, there is much stronger stress 
on <to>. In <I wanted to tell him, but I was afraid to> the final 
<to> is lightly stressed because it represents <to tell him>. In 
<to tell him>, of course, <to> is normally unstressed. When <I 
have instructions to leave> is equivalent in meaning to <I 
have instructions that I am to leave this place>, dominant stress 
is ordinarily on <leave>. When the same sequence is equivalent in 
meaning to <I have instructions which I am to leave>, dominant stress 
is ordinarily on <instructions>.   It is clear that patterns 
of stress sometimes 
show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where 
without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written. 
Other examples follow. "I'll come by Tuesday. I 
can't be happy long without drinking water". In the first of these 
sentences if <by> is the complement of <come> and <Tuesday> is 
an adjunct of time equivalent to <on Tuesday>, there will be strong 
stress on <by> in the spoken language; but if a complement for 
<come> is implied and <by Tuesday> is a prepositional unit used as 
an adjunct, <by> will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most. In 
the second sentence if <drinking water> is a gerundial clause and 
<without drinking water> is roughly equivalent in meaning to <unless 
I drink water>, there will be stronger stress on <water> than on 
<drinking>; but if <drinking> is a gerundial noun modifying <water> 
and <without drinking water> is equivalent to <without water 
for drinking>, there will be stronger stress on <drinking> than on 
<water>. But the use of stress in comparison and contrast, for example, 
can undermine distinctions such as these. And patterns of stress 
are not always unambiguous by any means. In <the Steiners have 
busy 
lives without visiting relatives> only context can indicate whether <visiting 
relatives> is equivalent in meaning to <paying visits to relatives> 
or to <relatives who are visiting them>, and in <I looked 
up the number> and <I looked up the chimney> only the meanings 
of <number> and <chimney> make it clear that <up> is syntactically 
a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed 
by its object in the second. 

#SYLLABIFICATION.#- Syllables are 
linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but, as 
has been noted, are consonantal under certain circumstances, and which 
may or may not be combined with preceding and/or following consonants 
or combinations of consonants. Syllables are genuine units, but division 
of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties. Sometimes 
even the number of syllables is not clear. Doubt on this point 
is strongest before /l/ and /@/ or /r/. From the point of view 
of 
word formation <real> might be expected to have two syllables. Historically 
~<re> is the formative that is employed also in <republic>, 
and ~<al> is the common suffix. When ~<ity> is added, 
<real> clearly has two syllables. But there is every reason to regard 
<deal> as a monosyllable, and because of the fact that /l/ commonly 
has the quality of /@/ when it follows vowel sounds, <deal> seems 
to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with <real>.

It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less 
successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels. 
No single explanation is adequate to account for this. Improvement, 
however, is urgent, and at least three things will be needed. 
The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses. Even 
beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable 
variety of consonant systems, both in their general outlines and in 
many specific details. An advanced student has read a considerable 
number of descriptions of consonantal systems, including some of the more 
unusual types. By contrast, even experienced linguists commonly know 
no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple 
distinction between register and contour languages. This limited 
familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work 
with tone. Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory 
until a more representative selection of systems is familar to 
every practicing field linguist. Papers like these four, if widely read, 
will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work.

The second need is better field techniques. The great majority 
of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping 
types: those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed, those who 
are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally, those who 
are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in 
those languages where it occurs, those who have no idea how to proceed 
with tone analysis, those who take a simplistic view of the whole 
matter. The result has been neglect, fumbling efforts, or superficial 
treatment. As these maladies overlap, so must the cure. Analyses such 
as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone 
is impossible and that it is simple. They will give suggestions that 
can be worked up into field procedures. Good field techniques will not 
only equip linguists for better work, but also help them overcome negative 
attitudes. Actually, none of these papers says much directly about 
field techniques. But it is worth pondering that very little has 
been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics. These 
things have been disseminated by other means, but always in the wake 
of extensive publication of analytic results.   The third need 
is for better theory. We should expect that general phonologic theory 
should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels, but it has 
not been. This can only be for one of two reasons: either the two 
are quite different and will require totally different theory (and hence 
techniques), or our existing theories are insufficiently general. 
If, as I suspect, the problem is largely of the second sort, then development 
of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically 
in better theory for all phonologic subsystems.   One issue 
that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different 
phonologic subsystems. Since tone systems typically comprise fewer 
units than either consonant or vowel systems, we might expect that they 
would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis. Actual practice 
does not often work out this way. Tone systems are certainly more complex 
than the number of units would suggest, and often analytically 
more difficult than much larger consonantal systems.   Welmers has 
suggested one explanation. Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts 
speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use. 
This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion 
for the more knowledgeable. The problem is to disentangle the 
linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic 
features. 
Of course, something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of 
the phonology: consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and 
an individual component. But in general the individual variation is 
a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude. 
With tone, individual differences may be greater than the linguistic 
contrasts which are superimposed on them. Pitch differences from 
one speaker to another, or from one emotional state to another, may far 
exceed the small differences between tones. However, any such suggestion 
accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone, or in 
developing a realistic attitude about tone, but not for the analytic 
difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded.

A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' 
paper. Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed. 
Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate 
the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the 
other. Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap 
in this way; for example, duration sometimes figures in both the 
vowel system and the intonation. Some phonetic features, for example 
glottal catch or murmur, are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics 
and sometimes to accentual systems. But no other two phonologic 
systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in 
some languages. This explanation of tone difficulties, however, does 
not apply in all languages. In some (the Ewe type mentioned above) 
interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation 
spans. In many of the syllables, intonation can be safely ignored, 
and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation. 
Still, even in such languages tone analysis has not been as 
simple as one might expect.   A third explanation is suggested 
by Richardson's analysis of Sukuma tone. There we see a basically 
simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic 
system. While the phonemes can be very easily stated, no one 
is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences 
can be related in some way to morphemic units, i&e& until the morphophonemics 
is worked out, or at least far enough that it seems reasonable 
to expect success.   In the "typical tone language", 
tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal 
morphophonemics. The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic 
systems, however, are very different. The inventory of tones 
is much smaller, and commonly the contrasts range along one single 
dimension, pitch level. Consonantal systems are not merely larger, they 
are multidimensional. Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining 
certain points in the system. The possibilities in the consonantal 
system are very numerous, and only a small portion of them are actually 
used. Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show 
a good bit of phonetic similarity, possible because of the several dimensions 
of contrast in the system. Tonal morphophonemics, in a common 
case, can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone. The possibilities 
are few, and the total number of rules may be considerably greater. 
Often, therefore, there are a number of rules having the same 
effect, and commonly other sets of rules as well, having the opposite 
effect. Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning 
analyst than consonantal morphophonemics, even when the total number 
of rules is no greater.   The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem 
in the phonology is an inverse function of the size- smaller systems 
are more troublesome- for any given degree of morphophonemic 
complexity. This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties 
of tonal analysis, as well as the fact that vowel systems are 
often more puzzling than consonantal systems. The statement of the system 
is a different matter. Smaller systems can of course be stated 
much more succinctly. A phonemic system can be stated without reference 
to morphophonemics, but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics. 
And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation 
to the phonemic base, the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed 
without close attention to the morphophonemics- at least, the less 
satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through 
morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures.

The design of orthographies has received much less attention from 
linguists than the problem deserves. There has been a tendency on the 
part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription 
will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only 
real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance. This 
seems naive. Most others have been content to give only the most 
general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology 
when designing orthographies. Apparently the feeling is that 
anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible 
pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs. 
The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography 
conferences by such considerations as typographic 'esthetics', 
which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices 
carried over from European languages. Many of the suggested systems 
seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures 
that they purport to represent. Linguists have not always been 
more enlightened than "practical people" and sometimes have insisted 
on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater 
significance. As a result, many people have been confirmed in their 
conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts 
can contribute anything but confusion.   A& E& Sharp, 
in Vowel-Length and Syllabicity in Kikuyu, examines one set of related 
orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail. His 
objective is merely to determine "what distinctions of length and 
syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography" 
(59). To do so, he finds it necessary to examine the relevant 
parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail. In the process, he 
develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort 
that are often difficult. A few of his examples are of very great interest, 
and the whole discussion of some importance for theory. His orthographic 
recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on 
the one hand or of superficiality on the other. Rather he weighs each 
phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness. He concludes 
that some changes can made in the current orthography which will 
appreciably improve its usefulness, but hesitates to suggest precise 
graphic devices to effect these changes. I hope his suggestions are 
given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles. This, however, 
will not exhaust their practical usefulness, as they rather clearly 
indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography 
design. We need many more studies of this sort if the design 
of written languages is to be put on a sound basis.   One other 
paper deals with a phonologic problem: Vowel Harmony in Igbo, by 
J& Carnochan. This restates the already widely known facts in terms 
of prosodies. As a restatement it makes only a small contribution 
to knowledge of Igbo. But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating 
the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems 
of Igbo phonology. The paper has a certain value as a comparatively 
easy introduction to this approach, particularly since it treats 
a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible 
to compare it with a more traditional (though not structural) statement. 
It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously 
described. But it does not, as it claims, demonstrate that this could 
not be treated by traditional methods. It seems to me that it rather 
easily can.   Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems. 
On the whole they maintain much the same high standard, but they 
are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider 
variety of subject matter. My comments must be briefer than the papers 
deserve.   W& H& Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical 
in Iraqw. This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement 
to his early A short Description of Item-Categories in Iraqw. 
It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much 
the same criticisms. The treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed 
and complex, largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems 
never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point. 
There are more stems per item in Athabascan, which expresses the fact 
that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in 
diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts. 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier; 
or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much 
larger territory (including three wholly separated areas); or both. 
The differentiation however is not very much greater, as shown by 
the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 
2.75 for Yokuts, with a slightly greater number of languages represented 
in our sample: 24 as against 21. (On deduction of one-eighth from 
3.46, the stem/item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number 
of languages.) These general facts are mentioned to make clear 
that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant 
comparison.   The greatest difference in the two sets of figures 
is due to differences in the two sets of lists used. These differences 
in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were 
built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning 
between illiterate informants and myself, within a compact and uniform 
territorial area, but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's 
second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating 
all items which might be culturally or geographically determined. Swadesh 
in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal; 
I, one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley. The 
result is that I included 70 animal names, but Swadesh only 4; 
and somewhat similarly for plants, 16 as against 4. Swadesh, and therefore 
Hoijer, felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even 
genera (<fox, vulture, salmon, yellow pine, manzanita>); their 
classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or 
recurrent parts (<fish, bird, tree, grass, horn, tail, bark, root>). 
The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as 
in size.   Other classes are included only by myself (interrogatives, 
adverbs) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer (pronouns, demonstratives).

What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes: 
(1) body parts and products, which with a proportionally nearly 
even representation (51 terms out of 253, 25 out of 100) come out with 
nearly even ratios; 2.6 and 2.7; (2) Nature (29 terms against 
17), ratios 3.3 versus 4.1; (3) adjectives (16, 15 terms), ratios 3.9 
versus 4.7; (4) verbs (9, 22 terms), ratios 4.0 versus 3.4. 
It will be seen that where the scope is similar, the Athabascan ratios 
come out somewhat higher (as indeed they ought to with a total ratio 
of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4:5) except for verbs, where alone the Athabascan 
ratio is lower. This exception may be connected with Hoijer's 
use of a much higher percentage of verbs: 22% of his total 
list as against 3.5% in mine. Or the exception may be due to a particular 
durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb. More word class ratios 
determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the 
question. 

#5.#

If word classes differ in their resistance or liability 
to stem replacement within meaning slot, it is conceivable that 
individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually. 
Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings (with 
allowance for several near-synonyms like <stomach-belly, big-large, 
long-far, many-much, die-dead, say-speak>). For Yokuts, 
I tabulated these 71 items in five columns, according as they were expressed 
by 1, 2, 3, 4, and more than 4 stems. The totals for these 
five categories are not too uneven, namely 20, 15, 11, 16, 9 respectively. 
For Athabascan, with a greater range of stems, the first two 
of five corresponding columns were identical, 1 and 2 stems; the three 
others had to be spread somewhat, and are headed respectively **f; 
**f; and **f stems. While the particular limits of these groupings 
may 
seem artificially arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding 
grouping of more variable material, and they eventuate also in five 
classes, along a similar scale, containing approximately equal numbers 
of cases, namely 19, 14, 15, 11, 12 in Athabascan.   When now 
we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing 
in the same column or grade, or one column or grade apart, or 
two or three or four, we find these differences: **f   This distribution 
can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart: 
**f; which, divided by **f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart. If 
the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families, 
the distance would of course be 0. If it were wholly random 
and unrelated, it would be 2.0, assuming the five classes were equal in 
~<n>, which approximately they are. The actual mean of 1.07 being 
about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation, 
it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity 
in the behavior even of particular INDIVIDUAL items of meaning 
as regards long-term stem displacement.

In 1960, David D& 
Thomas published Basic Vocabulary in some Mon-Khmer Languages 
~AL 2, no& 3, pp& 7-11), which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages 
with the ~I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised 
retention 
rate (**f) in place of original (**f), and his revised 100 word 
basic 
glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy **h (~IJAL 
21:121-137). Thomas' findings are, first, "that the individual 
items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence"; 
but, second, "that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying 
in their average persistence" (as between ~M-K and ~I-E. His 
first conclusion, on behavior of individual items, is negative, whereas 
mine (on Ath& and Yok&) was partially positive. His second 
conclusion, 
on semantic word classes, agrees with mine. This second conclusion, 
independently arrived at by independent study of material from two 
pairs of language families as different and remote from one another 
as these four are, cannot be ignored.   Thomas also presents a 
simple equation for deriving an index of persistence, which weights not 
only the number of stems ('roots') per meaning, but their relative 
frequency. Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per 
meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages, 100%; stem frequencies 
7 and 1, 86%; stem frequencies 4 and 4, 64%; stem frequencies 
4, 3, and 1, 57%. His formula will have to be weighed, may be 
altered or improved, and it should be tested on additional bodies of 
material. But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning 
seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations 
with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and Gleason 
presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area.

As to relative frequencies of competing roots (7-1 vs& 4-4, etc&), 
Thomas with his 'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered 
the significance this might have. The problem needs further 
exploration. I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full 
Yokuts presentation that awaits publication, in which, in listing 'Two-Stem 
Meanings', I set off by asterisks those forms in which 
~<n> of stem ~B was **f of stem ~A/3, the unasterisked ones 
standing for **f; or under 'Four Stems', I set off by asterisks 
cases where the combined ~<n> of stems **f was **f. 

#7.#

These 
findings, and others which will in time be developed, will affect 
the method of glottochronological inquiry. If adjectival meanings show 
relatively low retentiveness of stems, as I am confident will prove 
to be the case in most languages of the world, why should our basic 
lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms, but only 8 per cent 
of animals and plants which replace much more slowly? Had Hoijer 
substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items, 
his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan 
language separation smaller. And irrespective of the outcome 
in centuries elapsed since splitting, calculations obviously carry more 
concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable 
units 
than with variously unstable ones.   It is evident that Swadesh 
has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages 
but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior 
of lexical items. Why then this urge to include unstable items 
in his basic list? It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical 
and cultural conditioning as possible. And why that insistence? 
It is the hope of attaining a list of items of UNIVERSAL occurrence. 
But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is 
a snare. Not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer 
it comes to attaining universality, the less significant will it be 
linguistically. Its terms will tend to be labile or vague, and they 
will fit actual languages more and more badly.   The practical operational 
problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic 
list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms 
of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison. The most important 
quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as 
possible. In proportion as meanings are concrete, we can better rely 
on their being insulated and distinctive. An elephant or a fox or a swan 
or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality 
of obvious, common-sense, indubitable IDENTITY, as do an eye 
or tooth or nail. They isolate out easily, naturally, and unambiguously 
from the continuum of nature and existence; and they should be 
given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these 
qualities.   With the universal list as his weapon, Swadesh 
has 
extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past, eight, 
ten, twelve millennia back. And he has proclaimed greater or less 
affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages. Some of this 
may prove to be true, or even considerable of it, whether by genetic 
ramification or by diffusion and coalescence. But the farther out he 
moves, the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence, and the larger 
the speculative component in his inferences. He has traversed provinces 
and kingdoms, but he has not consolidated them behind him, nor 
does he control them. He has announced results on Hokan, Penutian, 
Uto-Aztecan, and almost all other American families and phyla, and 
has diagrammed their degree of interrelation; but he has not worked 
out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of 
even a single family other than Salish. That is his privilege. The 
remote, cloudy, possible has values of its own- values of scope, 
stimulus, potential, and imagination. But there is also a firm aspect 
to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization 
of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more 
remote and elusive external links; of classification first, with elapsed 
age merely a by-product; of acquiring evidential knowledge of 
what happened in Athabascan, in Yokuts, in Uto-Aztecan in the last 
few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have 
happened between them. This involves step-by-step progress, and such 
will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing 
body of scientific inquiry. If of the founders of glottochronology 
Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding, and Lees has repudiated his 
own share in the founding, that is no reason why we should swerve. 

#8.# 

There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh's 
rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown 
so vast. It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures 
for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble, solid, and limited basis.

I would propose, first, an abandonment of attempts at a 
universal lexical list, as intrinsically unachievable, and operationally 
inadequate in proportion as it is achieved.   I would propose, 
next, as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists, 
items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible. 
There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme 
of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable. An attempted 
middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary 
from which every fiftieth word was selected.

Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should 
arise about the methods for applying these policies. It was nevertheless 
almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a 
complete split over Germany, with hot heads on both sides planning to 
use the Germans against their former allies, and with Nazi-minded Germans 
expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the 
other. 

#5. POLAND#

_FRONTIERS._ When the Yalta Conference 
opened, the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's 
western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down. Starting 
in great force late in December, from a line stretching from 
East Prussia to Budapest, the Red armies had swept two hundred miles 
across Poland to the Oder, thirty miles from Berlin, and the Upper 
Danube region was being rapidly overrun, while the Western Allies 
had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine. The long 
delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage.

The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line, 
which was substantially Russia's 1941 border, as the boundary between 
Russia and Poland. When this proposal was made, Stalin spoke 
with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference. 
He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject. The bitter 
memory of Russia's exclusion from the Paris Peace Conference 
and of the West's effort to stamp out Bolshevism at its birth boiled 
up within him. "You would drive us into shame", he declared. 
The White Russians and the Ukrainians would say that Stalin and Molotov 
were far less reliable defenders of Russia than Curzon and Clemenceau.

Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted 
the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be 
digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland 
in some regions. He did not mind the Line itself, which Churchill 
declared in the House of Commons, on February 27, 1945, he had 
always believed to be "just and right", but he did not want it called 
by a hated name. The West had long since forgotten the events 
of 1919, but it was not so easy for the Red leaders, who felt that they 
had suffered great injustice in that period.   In the Dunn-Atherton 
memorandum of February 4, 1942, the State Department had expected 
to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to 
her 1941 boundaries. Now Stalin made it clear that he meant to move 
Poland's western borders deep into Germany, back to the western 
Neisse-Oder River lines, taking not only East Prussia and all of 
Silesia but Pomerania and the tip of Brandenburg, back to and including 
Stettin. From six to nine million additional Germans would be 
evicted, though most would have fled, and Poland would receive far more 
from Germany than the poor territories, including the great Pripet 
Marshes, which she lost to Russia. Stalin declared that he preferred 
to continue the war a little longer, "although it costs us blood", 
in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense 
of the Germans.   By this time Churchill was not so cordial toward 
moving Poland westward as he had been at Teheran, where he and 
Eden had both heartily approved the idea. After "a prolonged study 
of the Oder line on a map", at Teheran, Churchill "liked the 
picture". He would tell the Poles, he said, that they had been "given 
a fine place to live in, more than three hundred miles each way". 
At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would 
have to leave, trying to find work in Germany, and Roosevelt objected 
to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south, instead 
of the Eastern Neisse, both of which flow into the Oder.   The 
issue was left in abeyance, presumably for the peace conference. However, 
there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong 
Poland, both industrially and agriculturally, and one unplagued by large 
minorities of Germans or Russians. The moving of millions of the 
German master-race, from the very heart of Junkerdom, to make room 
for the Polish Slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate 
was a drastic operation, but there was little doubt that it 
was historically justified. _GOVERNMENT._ Of more importance to 
the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government. 
At Yalta the West still believed that Eastern Europe could 
be kept in its orbit, in spite of the onrushing Soviet armies. Though 
little democracy had ever been practised in this region, and much of 
it was still ruled by feudalistic means, it was taken for granted that 
at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this 
area and Western capitalism preserved within it. Believing devoutly 
as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions, it was important to both 
Roosevelt and Churchill that the Poles should have them.   The 
issue was acute because the exiled Polish Government in London, supported 
in the main by Britain, was still competing with the new Lublin 
Government formed behind the Red Army. More time was spent in 
trying to marry these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed at 
Yalta. The result was an agreement that the Lublin Government should 
be "reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion 
of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the Poles abroad", 
and pledged to hold "free and unfettered elections as soon as possible 
on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot". All 
"democratic and anti-Nazi parties" were to have the right to campaign.

Roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this 
issue. It was a matter of principle with Churchill, since Britain had 
declared war in behalf of Poland. To Stalin it was a matter of 
life and death. He made this completely clear. Speaking with "great 
earnestness", he said: "For the Russian people, the question 
of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security. 
Throughout history, Poland has been the corridor through which 
the enemy has passed into Russia. Twice in the last thirty years our 
enemies, the Germans, have passed through this corridor. It is in 
Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful, in a 
position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force **h. It 
is necessary that Poland should be free, independent in power. Therefore, 
it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the 
Soviet state".   In other words, the Soviet Union was determined 
to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against 
Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any 
question of her serving as a <cordon sanitaire> against the Soviets 
or posing as an independent, balancing power in between Russia and 
Germany. Byrnes says that invariably thereafter the Soviets used 
the same security argument to justify their course in Poland. This reasoning 
was also as inevitable as anything could be. Any free elections 
that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government 
in which Moscow had complete confidence, and all pressure from the West 
for free voting by anti-Soviet elements in Poland would be met 
by 
restrictions on voting by these elements. 

#6. LIBERATED EUROPE# 

In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern 
Europe, where the upper classes had generally collaborated with 
the Nazis, even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into 
Russia as a part of Hitler's armies. But at Yalta the conflicting 
expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by 
the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe "to 
create 
democratic institutions of their own choice". In any case "<where 
in their judgment conditions require>" [italics added] they 
would "form interim governmental authorities broadly representative 
of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest 
possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive 
to the will of the people". Other similar affirmations in the 
Declaration on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions 
on the Western model. Later it developed that the Soviets had 
a very different interpretation of democracy, which will be discussed 
later, and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should 
unite in establishing democratic conditions, as we understand them, 
within their zone of influence.   Professor McNeill thinks that 
at Yalta, Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him, 
that he thought the exclusion of the anti-Soviet voters from East 
European 
elections would not be greatly resented by his allies, while 
neither Roosevelt nor Churchill frankly faced "the fact that, in Poland 
at least, genuinely free democratic elections would return governments 
unfriendly to Russia", by any definition of international friendliness. 
Also war-time propaganda and cooperation had "obscured 
the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy", 
and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil 
the military victories over Germany and Japan.   The application 
of these formulae could not please both sides, for they really 
attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable. While obliged 
to concede governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union 
instead of opposed to it, we thought we had preserved our social and 
economic system in East Europe.   This illusion was described 
in a far-sighted editorial in the <New York Herald Tribune>, on 
March 5, 1947, in connection with the submission of the satellite peace 
treaties to the Senate. In doing so Marshall and Byrnes were "asking 
for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international 
life". We had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory 
automatically establishing our system throughout the world. "<We 
were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States. Yalta left us with 
comforting illusions of a Western capitalist-democratic political 
economy reigning supreme up to the Curzon line and the borders of Bessarabia>". 
[Italics added.]   This is a penetrating description 
of our post-war illusion, which applied to other areas than East 
Europe. The same editorial continued that "We expected to democratize 
Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself easily 
on our institutions. We expected, in short, that most of the world 
would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple, 
from such a position, to deal with the localized aberrations of 
the Soviet Union". Yet actually "the image corresponded in no 
way to the actualities of the post-war world. Neither our military, our 
economic nor our ideological power reached far enough" to determine 
the fate of East Europe. Then the editorial added prophetically: 
"how far they may reach in Asia is yet undetermined, but they fall 
far short of our dreams of the war conferences".   Here is 
the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been 
written. Failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite 
treaties, President Truman re-declared the Cold War on March 
12, 1947, in the Truman Doctrine, exactly one week after the <Herald 
Tribune> editorial was written, and a year after the Cold War 
had been announced by Churchill at Fulton, Missouri, in Truman's 
presence. Then China promptly went Communist, and Mr& Truman 
had to fight the interminable Korean war for the democratization of 
Korea before we learned how far our writ did "reach in Asia".

Years of war, strain, and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures 
and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the United 
States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World 
War /2,- Communist control of East Europe and China. _A 
NEW BALANCE OF POWER._ While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame 
it all on Yalta. Yet, in summarizing a series of careful essays 
on the Yalta Conference, Forrest Pogue could find no basis for Yalta 
becoming "a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents 
of Roosevelt and international cooperation". When the Yalta Papers 
were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal 
by anyone.

An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts. First 
is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation, planning 
and discussion. Preparation began slightly more than a year after 
independence with the first steps to organize rural communes. All 
political interests supported electoral planning, although there are some 
signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to 
some procrastination. The second major aspect of the election is the 
actual procedure of registration, nomination and voting. Considerable 
technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was 
generally above reproach. However, the regionally differentiated results, 
which appear below in tables, are interesting evidence of the problems 
of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances. 
A third aspect, and probably the one open to most controversy, 
is the results of the election. The electoral procedure prevented 
the ready identification of party affiliation, but all vitally interested 
parties, including the government itself, were busily engaged in 
determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the 
month following the elections. The fourth and concluding point will 
be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they 
figure in the current pattern of internal politics.   Elections 
have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official 
address since independence. They were stressed in the speeches 
of Si Mubarak Bekkai when the first Council of Ministers was formed 
and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council. 
King Muhammad /5, was known to be most sympathetic to the formation 
of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections 
on May Day, 1957. There followed a long and sometimes bitter 
discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957, in 
which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic 
view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic. 
Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and 
reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin 
until the fall of 1957, this goal appears somewhat ambitious.   From 
the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues 
in Moroccan politics, precisely the type of questions that were 
most difficult to resolve in the new government. Until the Charter 
of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958, there were no guarantees 
of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes. The 
Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957, but the P&D&I& (<Parti 
Democratique de l'Independance>), the most important minor 
party at the time, objected to the Istiqlal's predominance in the 
civil service and influence in Radio Maroc. There were rumors that 
the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary, "non-political" 
process, which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened 
in the planned meetings. The day following his intervention 
the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that "**h the 
possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral 
lists, lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation 
itself **h" would be supported by the King himself. 
The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration 
of elections, but French consultants were called in and notices of further 
investigation appeared from time to time. In January, 1958, the 
Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready 
to be submitted to the King, the rumors of election dates appeared once 
again, first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer. Although 
the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958, the 
first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied. 
In late 1957 the M&P& (<Mouvement Populaire>) appeared 
and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was 
revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed 
without support from progressive elements in the party. The parties 
were on the whole unprepared for elections, while the people were 
still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after 
effects of poor harvests in 1957.   Despite the internal and international 
crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central 
issue. They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May, 
1958, which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until 
elections could be held. But the eagerly sought "homogeneity" 
of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal 
quarreled over foreign policy, labor politics and economic development. 
By December, 1958, when 'Abdallah Ibrahim became President 
of the Council, elections had even greater importance. They were 
increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural 
communes as the focus of a new, constructive national effort. To minimize 
the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government 
was formed <a titre personnel> and a special office was created 
in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections. 
By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete. 
There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws 
through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number 
of 
policy decisions.   From the rather tortuous history of electoral 
planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first 
elections in a developing country and evaluating their results. In 
the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving 
fundamental, and sometimes bitter, differences among leaders and 
also as a source of policy guidance. In the absence of a reservoir 
of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections 
will give them new prominence, but in a system where there is 
as yet no place for the less prominent. Lacking the respected and effective 
institutions that consensus helps provide, minority parties, such 
as the P&D&I& in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction 
in 1958, clamor for elections when out of power, but are not at all 
certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power. Those 
in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral 
process. The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest 
rather than an instrument of national interest had two important 
effects 
on electoral planning in Morocco.   At the central level 
the <scrutin uninominal> voting system was selected over some form 
of the <scrutin de liste> system, even though the latter had been 
recommended by Duverger and favored by all political parties. The 
choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent 
by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas 
of the country, but it also served to minimize the national political 
value of the elections. Although the elections were for local officials, 
it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties 
from publicly identifying their candidates. With multiple member 
districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have 
operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to 
state their positions more clearly. Both parties and the Ministry of 
the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth 
the political affiliations of the successful candidates and, thereby, 
give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political 
significance. Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided 
it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize 
party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation.

The general setting of the Moroccan election may 
also encourage the deterioration of local party organization. The concentration 
of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering, 
but to distraction from local activity that might have had many 
auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections. 
Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber 
of Commerce elections, which took place three weeks before national 
elections. The Istiqlal sponsored U&M&C&I&A& (<L'Union 
Marocaine des Commercants, Industrialistes et Artisans>) 
was opposed by candidates of the new U&N&F&P& (<L'Union 
National des Forces Populaires>) in nearly all urban centers. 
As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy 
businessmen, the U&M&C&I&A& was generally favored 
against the more progressive, labor-based U&N&F&P& The 
newer party campaigned heavily, while the older, more confident party 
expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them 
as they had done for many years. The local Istiqlal and U&M&C&I&A& 
offices did not campaign and lost heavily. The 
value of the elections was lost, both as an experiment in increased political 
participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest, 
as shown in Table /1,.   The chamber of Commerce elections 
were, of course, an important event in the preparation for rural commune 
elections. The U&N&F&P& learned that its urban organization, 
which depends heavily on U&M&T& support, was most 
effective. The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of 
the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete, 
precise problems of internal politics. The overall effect was probably 
to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than 
might have otherwise taken place.   A second major point of this 
essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections. Although 
a somewhat technical subject, it has important political implications 
as the above discussion of the voting system indicated. Furthermore, 
the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of 
the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential 
to evaluating election results. The <sine qua non> of the elections 
was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure. As the 
background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts 
that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer 
elections. The P&D&I& and later the Popular Movement protected 
the Istiqlal's "privileged position" until the fall of 
Balafrej, and then the Istiqlal used the same argument, which it had 
previously ignored, against the pro-U&N&F&P& tendencies 
of the Ibrahim government.   The bulk of the preparation had, 
of course, proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior, 
whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally 
disinterested in party politics. Apart from some areas of recurring 
trouble, like Bani Mellal, where inexperienced officials had 
been appointed, there is little evidence that local officials intervened 
in the electoral process. Centrally, however, the administrative 
problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely 
an unfair advantage. The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week 
before elections and to institute a non-party Council of Government 
under his personal direction. Although the monarch had frequently asserted 
that the elections were to be without party significance, his action 
was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor. 
The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning, which 
was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U&N&F&P& 
members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders. Since the 
details of the elections were settled the change of government had no 
direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections, and may have 
been 
more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U&N&F&P&

Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959, 
although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes 
was completed in 1958. There were three major administrative tasks: 
the fixing of electoral districts, the registration of voters and the 
registration of candidates. Voter registration began in late November 
1959 and continued until early January, 1960. The government was 
most anxious that there be a respectable response. Periodic bulletins 
of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process 
into a kind of competition among provincial officials. A goal was fixed, 
as given in Table 2, and attention focused on its fulfillment. The 
qualifications to vote were kept very simple. Both men and women of 
twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof 
of residence and identification. There were liberal provisions for 
dispensation where documents or records were lacking. The police were 
disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens, criminals 
and those punished for Protectorate activities.   The 
registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution 
since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit 
of a reliable census.

Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment 
in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to 
secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future. Some 
vocational training schools provide such training, but the current 
need exceeds the facilities. _CURRENT PROGRAMS_ The present Federal 
program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of 
the Smith-Hughes Act, which provided a continuing annual appropriation 
of $7 million to support, on a matching basis, state-administered 
programs of vocational education in agriculture, trades, industrial skills 
and home economics. Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related 
acts have extended this Federal program. The George-Barden 
Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to 
$29 million in addition to the $7 million under the Smith Act. The 
Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse 
training.   The latest major change in this program was introduced 
by the National Defense Education Act of 1958, Title /8, of 
which amended the George-Barden Act. Annual authorizations of $15 
million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national 
defense needs for highly skilled technicians.   The Federal 
program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage 
the establishment of vocational education programs in public 
schools. The initiative, administration and control remain primarily 
with the local school districts. Even the states remain primarily in 
an assisting role, providing leadership and teacher training.   Federal 
assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure, and the 
state or local districts must pay at least half. The state may decide 
to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost, or the state 
may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it. 
Throughout the history of the program, state government expenditures 
in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures, 
while local districts all together have spent more than either 
Federal or state governments. Today, Federal funds account for only 
one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education. The 
greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially 
encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough 
to obtain their full allocation of outside funds.   National defense 
considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal 
training expenditures in recent decades. During World War /2, about 
7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special 
programs administered by state and local school authorities: (1) 
Vocational Education for National Defense, and (2) War Production 
Training. The total cost of the five-year program was $297 million. 
For the Smith-Hughes, George-Barden, and National Defense 
Act of 1958, the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years 
was only about $740 million.   No comparable measures are available 
of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education 
training. There are a great number and variety of private commercial 
schools, trade schools and technical schools. In addition, many large 
corporations operate their own formal training programs. A recent study 
indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations 
conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations.

Most skilled industrial workers, nevertheless, still 
acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions. The National 
Manpower Council of Columbia University has estimated that 
three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have 
not been formally trained.   There is little doubt that the students 
benefit from vocational education. Employers prefer to hire youth 
with such training rather than those without, and most graduates of 
vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training. Vocational 
educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled 
workers, but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills.

In most states, trade and industrial training is provided 
in a minority of the high schools, usually located in the larger cities. 
In Arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade 
and industrial courses. In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools 
have programs, and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent.   An important 
recent trend is the development of area vocational schools. For 
a number of years Kentucky, Louisiana and several other states have 
been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve 
nearby school districts in several counties. These schools are intended 
to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not 
be possible for very small school districts. Transportation may be 
provided from nearby school districts. Courses are provided mainly for 
post high school day programs; but sometimes arrangements also are 
made for high school students to attend, and evening extension courses 
also may be conducted.   The Title /8, program of the National 
Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward 
area schools. By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states. 
They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor 
surplus and in 10 of the minor areas. An extension of this program into 
the other distressed areas should be undertaken. _RELATION TO NEW 
INDUSTRY_ Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been 
related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their 
desire to attract new industry.   The major training need of a new 
industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a 
large number of semi-skilled machine operators. A few key skilled workers 
experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought 
in with the plant manager, or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere. 
A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run 
advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers 
and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees.

The existence of a public school vocational training program in 
trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled. 
Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs 
worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities, staff 
and program are in being. Thus, besides the training provided to youth 
in school, the existence of the school program can have supplementary 
benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development 
efforts.   Few states make effective use of their existing vocational 
education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new 
industry. The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their 
vocational education funds to apply on an <ad hoc> flexible basis 
to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly 
set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant. _LOCAL FOCUS 
OF PROGRAMS_ The major weakness of vocational training programs in 
labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands. 
This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas, for it is inherent 
in the system of local school districts in this country. 
Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to 
local employer needs for trained workers. All the manuals for setting 
up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a <local> 
survey of skill needs, of estimating the growth of <local> jobs, 
and of consulting with <local> employers on the types of courses and 
their content.   Furthermore, there is a cautious conservatism 
on the part of those making local skill surveys. Local jobs can be seen 
and counted, while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical.

While the U& S& Department of Labor has a 
program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and 
publishing current outlook statements, there is little tangible evidence 
that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum 
planning. The U& S& Office of Education continues to stress 
local surveys rather than national surveys.   This procedure is 
extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history 
of declining employment. Elaborate studies have been made in labor 
surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job 
vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify 
training programs for those skills. No effort is made in the same studies 
to present information on regional or national demand trends in these 
skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other 
skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be 
trained.   Moreover, the current information on what types of training 
are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary. There 
simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that 
are in demand and the types of training programs that are required 
or most suitable. Much of the available information comes not from the 
Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states. 
_PROPOSALS_ State and local agencies in the vocational education 
field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities. 
There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide 
research and information to help guide state education departments and 
local school boards in existing programs.   A related question 
is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided. 
There is little evidence that existing public or private training 
programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in 
their programs, even though they must pay tuition, receive no subsistence 
payments, and are not guaranteed a job. However, there always is 
some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire 
training. Again, one major difficulty is the local focus.   A 
training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there 
is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards, 
and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely 
at jobs in the local community. If there is adequate information on job 
opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere, many more workers can be 
expected to respond.   Another problem is who will pay for the training. 
Local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic 
about vocational training. Programs usually are expanded only 
when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand 
it. Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support 
for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it. State 
governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational 
schools, but their focus is still on area job opportunities. Only 
the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and 
nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower 
needs.   If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational 
education, it could be argued that the state should not have to 
bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in 
other states. However, if Federal funds are used, it would be entirely 
appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere 
as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment. Such training 
would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find 
jobs in other localities.   A further possibility is suggested 
by the example of the G& I& bills and also by some recent trends 
in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide 
financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local 
facilities are inadequate. This probably would require some support 
for subsistence as well as for tuition, but the total would be no 
greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth 
Conservation Corps. A maximum of $600 per year per student would 
enable many to take training away from home.   A program of financial 
assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest 
in training highly skilled labor. Instead of being limited to the poor 
training facilities in remote areas, the student would be able to 
move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training. Such 
specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly 
growing industries, where the equipment and job experience exist 
and 
where the future employment opportunities are located. This would heighten 
possibilities for part-time cooperative, on-the-job and extension 
training.   Personal financial assistance would enable more 
emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual. His aptitudes 
and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper 
training.

But briefly, the topping configuration must be examined for its 
inferences. Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had 
further forecasting significance. And then the application of the 
count rules to the width (horizontally) of the configuration give us an 
intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline. The very idea 
of their being "count rules" implies that there is some sort of proportion 
to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and 
the extent of the breakaway (run up or run down) movement. This expectation 
is what really "sold" point and figure. But there is no positive 
and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense. 
Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply, and 
in fine, these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations 
and intensities of events. After all, too much does not happen too 
suddenly, nor does very little take long.   The advantages and disadvantages 
of these two types of charting, bar charting and point and 
figure charting, remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation 
among their respective professional advocates, with both methods enjoying 
in common, one irrevocable merit. They are both trend-following 
methods. Even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum, 
the "odds" still favor them both, for the trend in effect is 
always 
more likely to continue than to reverse.   Of course, many 
more things are charted besides prices. The foregoing have been methods 
of charting prices, but now let us look at some of the other indices 
that are customarily charted, and which are looked to for their forecasting 
abilities. _THE QUEST FOR METHODS_ The search for forecasting 
formulae is ceaseless. Correlations have been worked up between 
the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price. The theory 
behind this is, of course, fundamentalist in character. As the number 
of reported freight car loadings increased, this was taken to indicate 
increased industrial activity, and consequently increased stock earnings, 
implying fatter dividends, and implying therefore increased stock 
market prices. We now know that things rarely ever work out in such 
cut-and-dried fashion, and that car loadings, while perhaps interesting 
enough, are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn 
before stock prices turn.   But the quest for such an index 
goes on ceaselessly, with all manner of investors and speculators participating, 
ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the 
proverbial shoe-string operator, all seeking doggedly, studiously, daily- 
and often nightly- for the enchanting index that will foretell 
the eternal secret: Which way will the market move; up or down? 
It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth, 
a quest heavily invested in, during the days of wooden ships. Just 
as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who 
carry on the quest for the enchanting index. The quest offers careers. 
Much of this goes on in offices high up in Wall Street's lofty 
wind-swept towers.   There sit men who make moving averages of 
weekly volume, monthly averages of price-earnings ratios, ratios of 
the number of advances to the number of declines, ratios of an individual 
stock's performance to overall market performance, ratios of rising 
price volume to falling price volume, odd-lot indices, and what not. 
They are concerned with all things traded in, securities, bonds, cocao, 
coffee, soybeans, cotton, tin, oats, etc&.   And along 
Chicago's 
West Jackson Boulevard, La Salle Street, and around the 
Merchandise Mart Plaza there sit men who chart crop reports, who divide 
the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs, 
and the number of hogs by the amount of corn. They plot the open 
interest curves, rainfall curves, and they even divide Democratic 
congressmen by Republican congressmen. All these things and countless 
more enter into their calculations, and yet, the enchanting index remains 
non-forthcoming. Not, at any rate, in the fuller sense of the word.

The markets are far too subtle, and the last word in these 
endeavors will doubtless never be written, for the enchanting index 
is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth.   But whereas civilized 
men no longer pursue the fountain, they never abandoned their pursuit 
of the enchanting index.   We mentioned odd-lot indices a 
few paragraphs ago. In the stock market, the normal trading package 
is a hundred shares, just as 5,000 bushels is the standard grain contract 
package. A stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed 
via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange. This 
results in a separate record being made, distinguishing these trades 
from the overall volume of trading.   According to the theory underlying 
odd-lot indices, the trader who trades odd lots is most likely 
a small trader, one who can't afford to trade round lots. Or, to 
use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast, they represent 
a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders. Falling 
most easily prey to an adverse market movement, for this rank of traders 
can least afford to lose, virtually anything the odd-lot traders 
do, marketwise, is taken to exemplify the "wrong" thing to do.

Figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales 
are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers. 
Odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their 
particular statistical recipe. They might, for example, plot it exactly 
as is, or they might make ten day moving averages of it, or longer 
moving averages, or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases 
to odd-lot sales. The particular recipe is a matter of individual 
taste. The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price 
chart, usually of a popular stock average.   Towards the end of 
an intermediate or major rise, while the top is forming on the price 
chart, it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply. 
This warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite 
likely to be a top. Similarly, at the opposite end of the market cycle, 
towards the end of an intermediate or major decline, usually while 
the bottom is being formed on the price chart, it is characteristic 
that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist 
that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood. Thus, in the aggregate, 
the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the 
bottoms, notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions.   While 
it had long been known in general, that "the public is always wrong", 
the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical 
basis.   One might well wonder why the "public is always wrong" 
and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned 
with the chicken and the egg. Which came first? Is it really that 
the "public" buys at the tops, and not that the market tops out when 
the "public" buys? And the converse at bottoms. Does the "public" 
usually sell at bottoms, or does the market usually bottom 
out when the "public" sells?   We have been using the word 
"public" in quotation marks, that is, in its vernacular connotation 
with reference to the odd-lot index theory. Obviously someone has 
to sell in order for someone to buy, and vice versa. And while all concerned 
are members of the literal public, somewhat less than all concerned, 
although still a majority, form the quotation marked "public". 
And the public minus the "public" leaves the so-called "sophisticated" 
element- the element on the other end of the "public's" 
transactions.   This element is often called "strong 
hands". Strong hands differ from "weak hands" in that their operations 
are the primary movers. They initiate campaigns, so to speak, 
even if this initiation is diffused among them, and their concerted action 
only psychologically organized. Strong hands act; weak hands 
react. Strong hands move first; weak hands ask, What is going on? 
When strong hands buy, they are able to buy more, and they do it even 
in the face of bearish news reports. They are able to sit more patiently 
with what they have bought. Needless to say, strong hands are 
not eager to be joined by weak hands, for this increases the risk that 
they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up, 
at higher prices, during the run-up phase of the campaign.   Certain 
badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there 
is something somehow unfair, dirty, or even thoroughly criminal about 
this interplay of competitive forces. But after all, can anyone imagine 
a market wherein the reverse of these things were true? Try to 
imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose, and 
the majority would make consistent profits. How much and how many profits 
could a majority take out of the losses of a few?   Moreover, 
the taunt concerning the "sophisticated" echelon and its alleged 
erudition is put to test during every campaign, and accrues only 
upon results; not before. It quite often happens that campaigns go 
askew, resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands 
into played-out hands, just as a member of a former campaign's "public" 
may emerge flatteringly "right" the next time. Membership 
in the echelons fluctuates too.   The study of odd-lot indices 
is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow, 
what with all observers trying to get on the side of the "few" 
at the same time. The usefulness of this study and of configuration 
analysis as well, declines in direct proportion to the dissemination 
of its use. It has to, by virtue of the very dictionary definition of 
the word "few".   Diametric opposition must persist as to 
the future course of prices, if there is to persist a market at all. And 
the few must win what the many lose, for the opposite arrangement 
would not support markets as we know them at all, and is, in fact, unimaginable. 
There need be no squeamishness about admitting this. Anyone 
still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited 
to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what 
the minority loses.   Mr& John Magee, whose work has been discussed 
in this chapter, was quoted in a New Yorker magazine profile 
as saying- "**h Of course, you have to remember it's a good thing 
for us chartists that there aren't more of us. If you got too 
many people investing by this method, their operations would begin to 
affect stock prices, and thus throw the charts off. The method would 
become self-defeating".   Mr& Alexander H& Wheelan's 
Study Helps in Point and Figure Technique tells the readers- "We 
assure you that the total number of people using this method of 
market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating 
in the securities and commodities markets".   What with 
traders trading for so many different objectives, and what with there 
being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading 
techniques in use, and more coming into use all the time, it is hard to 
imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough 
"fans" to invalidate itself. Nevertheless, all theories and techniques 
lead but to one of two possible modes of expression, if they lead 
to a market committment at all. In the final analysis, then, the user 
becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance, notwithstanding 
any amount of forethought and calculation, however elaborate. Thus 
while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed, it is commonplace 
for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed. 
Though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse, the 
possible conclusions remain but two. 

#CHAPTER /6, MORE METHODS# 

_THE HOAXES_ The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book 
was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge 
of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already 
in use, so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself 
the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that 
is to follow, and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests 
for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead.

IN assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961, the 
question, as always, is the prospect for general business activity. 
By 
and large, what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship 
between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and 
will thus determine interest rates. Moreover, the trend of general business 
activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal, monetary, 
and other Federal policies which affect interest rates.

Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business 
activity. During much of the year the general level of business 
activity has moved along on a record-high plateau, but there have been 
persistent signs of slack in the economy. The tendency for general 
business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident. 
Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year 
has thus far been quite modest, it is hard to escape the conclusion 
that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 
and possibly somewhat longer. It is difficult to see any powerful 
sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the 
economy a new upward thrust. The rate of plant and equipment spending 
by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some 
decline. In earlier business cycles, when this occurred the country usually 
experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage 
financing became easier to obtain. At this time, however, there are 
signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with 
the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction. 
These signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of 
the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments (7.6% 
in September). On the other hand, in a more favorable vein, general 
business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal 
spending, and the reduction in business inventories has probably 
run a good part of its course. The 2% increase in retail sales in October 
to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well 
as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference 
Board, which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans.

The pattern of general business activity which probably lies 
ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 
before a new rise in economic activity gets under way. The recovery 
will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring 
in response to more readily available mortgage credit, as well as by 
an expansion of Government spending, well sustained consumer spending, 
and some rebuilding of business inventories. 

#SLIGHT DOWNWARD PRESSURE# 

What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend 
of long-term rates in 1961? It suggests that during the next several 
months, through the spring of 1961, the demand for long-term capital 
funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to 
move a little lower, especially the rates on Federal, state, and local 
bonds, as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds. However, 
as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present, as well 
as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters, the 
over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high, so that 
any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great. 
It seems likely, 
moreover, that with an increase in the rate of 
saving in mortgage lending institutions, interest rates on residential 
mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year, although 
the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily 
in other terms than interest rate, e&g&, easier downpayment 
and amortization terms.   If the trend of general business activity 
follows the pattern suggested here, we are likely to see additional 
steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability 
of credit. Certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would 
be a strong possibility, as well as an easier reserve position for the 
banking system. However, the monetary authorities will continue to 
be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with 
respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow 
of gold, as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive 
liquidity in the economy, which would delay the effectiveness of 
monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle. 

#OPEN MARKET POLICY#

One of the most intriguing questions is 
whether the recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities from 
confining their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread 
into longer-term Government securities in the next few months. To 
the extent that the new Administration has its wishes, the Federal 
Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire 
maturity range of Government securities and aggressively seek to force 
down long-term interest rates. The principle of "bills only", 
or "bills preferably", seems so strongly accepted by the Federal 
Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade 
the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open 
market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities. 
However, to the extent that the monetary authorities, in their effort 
to ease credit in the next several months, conduct their open market 
operations in longer-term Government bonds, they will certainly act to 
accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result 
of market forces.   By the end of the spring of 1961, assuming 
that a general business recovery gets under way, interest rates should 
begin to edge upward again, depending upon the vigor of the recovery 
and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to 
restrain credit availability. My guess would be that interest rates will 
decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half 
of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during 
the downturn.   It is pertinent to ask the question: Has the 
long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about 
run its course, and are we now entering a period in which both capital 
market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline 
of interest rates? My answer is in the negative because I believe 
that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press 
against available supplies, and interest rates will generally tend to 
be firm at high levels. 

#FIVE BASIC FORCES#

This view is based upon 
several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in 
the Sixties, as follows: _(1)_ Recent events in the General 
Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain 
with us, and probably intensify, for the foreseeable future. This makes 
it certain that Federal expenditures for military preparedness and 
foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several 
years. We are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the 
friendship of the new African nations against the ruthless competition 
of the Communist bloc. Our efforts to overcome the lead of the 
Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending. Moreover, 
it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster 
rate of economic growth of the country, to keep ahead of the Communist 
countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better 
than theirs, will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas 
such as education, housing, medical aid, and the like. There are 
serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures, 
of which I take a dim view, but it seems very likely to occur. 
_(2)_ During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping 
up in the rate of household formations, which should contribute 
to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building. According 
to the latest 
projections of the Bureau of the Census, the annual 
rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years. Under 
the most favorable assumptions for increase, the Bureau of the 
Census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise 
from about 883,000 in the last two years of the Fifties to an annual 
rate of about 1,018,000 in the first five years of the Sixties, and 
to a slightly higher annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the 
decade. During the Seventies the projections show a more pronounced 
rise to an annual rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade. 
Accordingly, the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing 
occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the 
general economic prospects of the Sixties. However, the impact of 
a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated. 
The average annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the 
Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in 
the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950. _(3)_ With 
the expansion of family formation in the Sixties, a continued substantial 
rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems 
to be indicated. This is an area in which there is still a large backlog 
of demand. State and local expenditures (in real terms) increased 
persistently from $26.5-billion in 1949 to $44.3-billion in 1959, and 
it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this 
decade, which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion 
by 1970. Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity. 
_(4)_ It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play, 
the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures 
should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties. Spurred 
by keen competition in our industrial system, and still further 
increases in the funds devoted to industrial research, plant and equipment 
expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade. 
_(5)_ In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook, 
I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing 
which was dammed-up during the Thirties and World War /2, is finally 
in the process of running dry. There is some clear-cut evidence 
of this. For example, the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans 
for housing under the ~VA home loan guaranty program seems to have 
largely exhausted itself. Indeed, the failure of home-building as a 
whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage 
financing, and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and 
rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings, may also signal in part 
that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an 
end. In a way, we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles 
today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car 
coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of 
the frills which were accepted in the Fifties. The huge backlog of demand 
which was evident in the first decade and a half after the War 
was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the War, and 
even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and 
home loan fields. The consuming public has used up a good part of these 
liquid assets, or they have been drained by the rising price level, 
and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer 
or home mortgage terms easier. This is not to say that the level 
of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the Sixties. I 
am confident that it will, but consumer spending in the Sixties will 
not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized 
most of the Fifties. Markets should become more competitive 
as consumers become more selective. 

#SIXTIES' CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS# 

Accordingly, during the Sixties our national economy is likely 
to grow at as fast a rate as in the Fifties and, in the process, to 
require enormous amounts of capital funds.

Wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of 
forces- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases. 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which 
has not been treated in the literature, but which we believe makes a 
significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few 
very important industries. While there may be several such industries 
to which the model of this paper is applicable, the authors make particular 
claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages 
and prices in the steel industry of the United States since World 
War /2,. Indeed, the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude 
in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the 
model here presented.   The model of this paper considers an industry 
which is not characterized by vigorous price competition, but 
which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous 
critical public scrutiny. Where the industry's product price 
has been kept below the "profit-maximizing" and "entry-limiting" 
prices due to fears of public reaction, the profit seeking producers 
have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands. 
The contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition, 
and an exploration of some of its implications.   In order 
to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force, which we may call 
the effect of "public-limit pricing" on "key" wage bargains, 
we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces, 
such as union power, which may be relevant in an actual situation. For 
expository purposes, this is best treated as a model which spells 
out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the 
public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence 
of union pressures for higher wages.   Part /1, below describes 
this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions. Part /2, 
discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant 
conclusions. Part /3, discusses the empirical relevance and policy 
implications of the conclusions. Part /4, is a brief summary. The 
Mathematical Appendix presents the rigorous argument, but is best read 
after Part /1, in order that the assumptions underlying the equations 
may be explicit. #/1, THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE MODEL#

_A. 
THE INDUSTRY_ The industry with which this model is concerned is a 
basic industry, producing a substantial share of gross national product. 
Price competition is lacking. For the purposes of setting the product 
price, the industry behaves as a single entity. In wage negotiations, 
the industry bargains as a unit with a single union. _B. THE DEMAND 
FOR THE INDUSTRY'S PRODUCT_ We are concerned with aggregate 
demand for the industry's product. The manner in which this is shared 
among firms is taken as given. In any given time period, the aggregate 
demand for the industry's product is determined by two things: 
the price charged by the industry, and the level of ~GNP. For 
the purposes of this discussion, the problem of relative prices is encompassed 
in these two variables, since ~GNP includes other prices. 
(We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices 
of all other products change proportionately.)   The form of 
the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary 
inversely with the product price, and vary directly with the level of 
~GNP. _C. INDUSTRY PRODUCT PRICE POLICY_ The industry of 
this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected 
with a public interest. Because of its importance, and because the 
lack of price competition is well recognized, the industry is under considerable 
public pressure not to raise its price any more than could 
be justified by cost increases. The threat of effective anti-trust action, 
provoked by "gouging the public" through price increases not 
justified by cost increases, and fears of endangering relations with 
customers, Congress, the general public and the press, all operate 
to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases. For the 
industry of this model, the effect of such public pressures in the 
past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing 
price (given the wage rate and the level of ~GNP), and even 
below the entry-limited price (but not below average cost).   For 
such an industry, it is only "safe" to raise its price if such an 
increase is manifestly "justified" by rising costs (due to rising 
wages, etc&). Thus, if public pressure sets the effective limit to 
the price that the industry may charge, this pressure is itself a function 
of the wage rate. In this model, we abstract from all non-wage 
sources of cost changes, so that the "public-limit price" <only> 
rises as the wage rate rises. In such circumstances, it may well be 
to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage 
rate.   Since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises, the 
profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated, 
and is likely to remain well above the latter. The entry-limiting 
price will also be raised for potential domestic competition, but 
unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately 
throughout the economy, we might expect the public-limit price 
to approach the entry-limit price. The foreign-entry-limit price would 
be approached more rapidly, since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign 
costs directly. Where this approach becomes critical, the industry 
can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its 
sincerity in "resisting" the wage pressures of a powerful union, 
requesting 
tariff relief after it has "reluctantly" acceded to the union 
pressure.   Whether or not it is in the industry's interest 
to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent 
to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage 
increase, and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying 
the wage increase. The extent to which the public-limit price 
is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a 
function of three things: the passage of time, the level of ~GNP, 
and the size of the wage increase.   We are abstracting from 
the fact of strikes here, but it should be obvious that the extent to 
which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic 
wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the 
industry. The industry may deliberately take a strike, not to put pressure 
on the union, but in order to "educate" the government and 
the customers of the industry. As a strike continues, these parties increase 
their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement. They become 
increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry 
claims the wage bargain would entail.   Public indignation and 
resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases 
are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are 
on the order of 3% per month. The simple passage of an additional 
eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more acceptable. Thus, 
the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase 
the longer it has been since the previous price increase. Notice, however, 
that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices 
<per se>, without an accompanying wage increase. Similarly, higher 
levels of ~GNP do not, in themselves, provide grounds for raising 
prices, but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that 
it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase. This is not 
extended to anticipated levels of ~GNP, however- only the current 
level of ~GNP affects the public pressure against wage-price increases. 
Finally, since the public requires some restraint on the part 
of the companies, larger wage increases call for less than proportionately 
larger price increases (e&g&, if a wage increase of 5% allows 
a price increase of 7%, a wage increase of 10% allows a price 
increase of something less than 14%). _D. INDUSTRY COSTS_ We 
assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation 
is constant with respect to quantity produced (the average cost curve 
is horizontal, and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve), 
and is the same for every firm (and therefore for the industry). 
The <level> of this average cost is determined by factor prices, technology, 
and so forth. As we have noted, however, we are abstracting 
from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in 
the wage rate. The level of average cost (equal to marginal cost) is 
thus strictly a function of the wage rate. _E. UNION POLICIES AND COLLECTIVE 
BARGAINING ISSUES_ The single union which faces the industry 
does not restrict its membership, and there is an adequate supply 
of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate. 
The union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter 
of concern when setting its own wage policy- its concern with employment 
makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain 
full employment.   The union vigorously demands wage increases from 
productivity increases, and wage increases to offset cost-of-living 
increases, but we abstract from these forces here. For our present 
purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage 
rate (not including productivity improvement factors or cost-of-living 
adjustments), and it is this basic wage rate which determines the 
level of costs. Productivity is something of an amorphous concept and 
the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even 
well known to the industry, much less to the union or to the public. 
Disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the 
problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity 
increase should be shared. The existence of conflict and of 
vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict 
the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost-of-living 
and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase 
in the basic wage rate.   We assume further that the union 
recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate 
increases, and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price 
increases arising from its own wage increases upon the "real" 
wage rate. For internal political reasons, the union asks for (and accepts) 
increases in the <basic> wage rate, and would vigorously oppose 
a reduction in this rate, but the adjustment of the basic wage rate 
upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry.

Changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising, and 
they constitute an argument for raising prices. However, it is not known 
to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase 
is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate, although the 
companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude.

In this model, then, the industry is presumed to realize that 
they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate, but since 
such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may, 
in circumstances to be spelled out in Part /2, below, find it to 
their advantage to allow the wage rise. Thus, for non-negative changes 
in the basic wage rate, the industry becomes the active wage-setter, 
since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason 
of industry acquiescence. The presumption in the literature would appear 
to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case, on 
the grounds that it is "clearly" not in the interest of the industry 
to raise wages gratuitously. From this presumption it is an easy 
step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate 
must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed 
in our model. It is this conclusion that we challenge; we do 
so by disproving the presumption on which it is based. #/2, THE OPERATION 
OF THE MODEL#

It is convenient to assume that the union-industry 
contract is of one year's duration.

In the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international 
law. Several factors contributed to this change.   The 
Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point because it both 
epitomized and symbolized what was to follow. Here in 1815 the great 
nations assembled to legislate not merely for Europe, but for the world. 
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition of the political system 
that was central to world politics for a century. International 
law had to fit the conditions of Europe, and nothing that could not 
fit this 
system, or the interests of the great European nations collectively, 
could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense. Essentially 
this imposed two conditions: First, international law had to recognize 
and be compatible with an international political system in which 
a number of states were competitive, suspicious, and opportunistic 
in their political alignments with one another; second, it had to 
be compatible with the value system that they shared. In both respects, 
international law was Europeanized.   It was not always easy 
to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions. 
On the one hand, the major European nations had to maintain vis-a-vis 
each other an emphasis upon sovereignty, independence, formal equality- 
thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of 
action to maintain the "flexibility of alignment" that the system 
required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous 
Napoleonic experience. But there was no pressing need to maintain 
these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world. 
Thus, theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the 
smaller European states did not really comfortably fit less developed 
and less powerful societies elsewhere. Political interference in Africa 
and Asia and even in Latin America (though limited in Latin America 
by the special interest of the United States as expressed in 
the Monroe Doctrine, itself from the outset related to European politics 
and long dependent upon the "balance of power" system in Europe) 
was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values 
and the European "balance" itself. A nation such as Switzerland 
could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect 
its neutrality; more doubtful, but possible, (with an assist from the 
North) was the neutralization of the Latin American countries; 
out of the question was the neutralization of Asia and Africa.

This Europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 
19th century scholars. More emphasis was put upon the fact that international 
law was the law of "civilized nations"; Kent and Story, 
the great early American scholars, repeatedly made use of this phrase, 
or of "Christian nations", which is a substantial equivalent. 
Wheaton stated that the public law was essentially "limited to the 
civilized and Christian peoples of Europe or to those of European 
origin". Of course it had always been of European origin in fact, 
but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory. 
Now, with virtually every writer, not only was the European origin 
of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon, but the rules 
thus established by the advanced civilizations of Europe were to be imposed 
on others. The European customs on which international law was 
based were to become, by force and fiat, the customs that others were 
to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states. 
Hall, for example, was quite explicit on this point when he said 
"states outside European civilization must formally enter into the 
circle of law-governed countries. They must do something with the 
acquiescence of the latter, or some of them, which amounts to an acceptance 
of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction". 
During the nineteenth century these views were protested by 
virtually all the Latin American writers, though ineffectively, just 
as the new nations of Africa and Asia protest them, with more effect, 
today.   A number of other nineteenth-century developments 
contributed 
to the transmutation of the law of nations into international 
law; that is, from aspects of a universal system of Justice into 
particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states. The difference 
is important, for although the older law of nations did cover 
relationships among sovereigns, this was by no means its exclusive domain. 
The law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to 
their own citizens, to foreigners, and to each other in a conceptually 
unified system. The theory of international law, which in the nineteenth 
century became common to virtually all writers in Europe and America, 
broke this unity and this universality. It lost sight of the 
individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise 
of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice 
or morality save as these values might affect international relations. 
No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine 
what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit 
his freedom of action.   To appreciate this development, we 
must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy. First, 
and most obvious, was the growing nationalism and the tendency to 
regard the state, and the individual's identification with the state, 
as transcending other ties of social solidarity. National identification 
was not new, but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout 
Europe as new unifications occurred. It reached its ultimate 
philosophical statement in notions of "state will" put forward by 
the Germans, especially by Hegel, although political philosophers will 
recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of Hobbes. National 
identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which 
incorporated this Hegelian abstraction and saw law, domestic and international, 
simply as its formal reflection. In the international community 
this reduced law to Jellinek's auto-limitation. A state, the 
highest form of human organization in fact and theory, could be subjected 
to Law only by a manifestation of self-will, or consent. According 
to the new theories, the nineteenth century corporate sovereign 
was "sovereign" in a quite new and different sense from his historical 
predecessors. He no longer sought to find the law; he made it; 
he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be. There was 
no law, domestic or international, except that willed by, acknowledged 
by, or consented to by states.   Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions 
were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence. Related 
to, but distinguishable from, nationalism was the growth of democracy 
in one form or another. Increased participation in politics and 
the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic 
effects upon law institutions. The efforts of various interest groups 
to control or influence governmental decisions, particularly when 
taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization, led to a concentration 
of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby 
policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions. 
Law became a conscious process, something more than simply 
doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for 
applicable norms. Particularly was this true when the norms previously 
applied were no longer satisfactory to many, when customs were rapidly 
changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed. The 
old way of doing things, which depended on a relatively stable community 
with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations, was no longer 
adequate to the task. First was the period of codification of existing 
law: the Code Napoleon in France and the peculiar codification 
that, in fact, resulted from Austin's restatement and ordering of 
the Common Law in England. Codification was followed in all countries 
by a growing amount of legislation, some changing and adjusting 
the older law, much dealing with entirely new situations. The legislative 
mills have been grinding ever since, and when its cumbersome processes 
were no longer adequate to the task, a limited legislative authority 
was delegated in one form or another, to the executive. Whereas 
the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice, the 
nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied 
with law. Indeed, with developed positivism, the separation of law 
from justice, or from morality generally, became quite specific.

In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as 
fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power 
of parliament- the elected representatives- at the expense of the 
more conservative judiciary. When the power of the latter was made 
both limited and explicit- when norms were clarified and made more precise 
and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary 
hands- two purposes were served: Government was made subservient 
to an institutionalized popular will, and law became a rational 
system for implementing that will, for serving conscious goals, for embodying 
the "public policy". It is true that, initially, the task 
was to remove restrictions that, it was thought, inhibited the free 
flow of money, goods, and labor; but even laissez-faire was a conscious 
policy. Law was seen as an emanation of the "sovereign will". 
However, the sovereign was not Hobbes' absolute monarch but rather 
the parliamentary sovereign of Austin. It was, too, an optimistic 
philosophy, and, though it separated law from morality, it was by no means 
an immoral or amoral one. Man, through democratic institutions 
of government and economic freedom, was master of his destiny. The theory 
did not require, though it unfortunately might acquire, a Hegelian 
mystique. It was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions 
of popular government. It was not opposed to either justice 
or morality; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials 
who wielded public authority.   Particularly was this true as 
laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of Western society. 
To free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising 
bourgeoisie, and this objective required that governmental authority- 
administrative officials and judges- be limited as precisely 
and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade be 
abrogated; that business be free from governmental supervision and 
notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the 
free market; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with 
the new politics and the new economics be done away with. Contract- 
conceived as the free bargain of formal equals- replaced the implied 
obligations of a more static and status-conscious society. Indeed, 
contract was the dominant legal theme of the century, the touchstone 
of the free society. Government itself was based upon contract; business 
organization- the corporation- was analyzed in contractual terms; 
trade was based on freedom of contract, and money was lent and 
borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen 
as a contractual arrangement. It is not surprising that the international 
obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract. In 
fact, some- Anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as 
to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal 
norm, <Pacta sunt Servanda>.   The displacement (at least to 
a considerable extent) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law 
theory and doctrine. In the first place the new doctrine brought 
a 
formal separation of international from municipal law, rejecting the earlier 
view that both were parts of a universal legal system. One result 
was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations. 
Admiralty law, the law merchant, and the host of problems which arise 
in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country 
were all severed from the older Law of Nations and made dependent 
on the several national laws. Private international law (which Americans 
call the "conflict of laws") was thus segregated from international 
law proper, or, as it is often called, public international law. 
States were free to enact, within broad though (perhaps) determinate 
limits, their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their 
courts, to vary the law merchant, and to enact legislation with regard 
to many claims arising on the high seas. The change was not quite 
so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be 
invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation, 
and then largely in marginal situations. 
Mr& Justice Black was one of the minority that rested on the Article 
/1, power. In this view, supported by only three members of the 
Court, a power denied by the specific provisions of Article /3, 
was granted by the generality of Article /1,. If this seems arbitrary, 
its effect was to treat citizens of the District of Columbia equally 
with citizens of the states- at the expense of expanding a troublesome 
jurisdiction. 

#FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION#

For almost 
a hundred years we relied upon state courts (subject to review by the 
Supreme Court) for the protection of most rights arising under national 
law. Then in 1875, apparently in response to the nationalizing 
influence of the Civil War, Congress first gave the lower federal courts 
general authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide 
cases involving federal-right questions. One purpose of the change 
was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the Civil 
War amendments against state interference. Serious difficulty arose 
with the advent of Substantive Due Process. An amendment, presumably 
designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves, became 
a "laissez-faire" limitation upon state economic policy. A flood 
of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of 
local government. Congress reacted with a series of measures modifying 
in various ways what it had granted in 1875. In 1910 it required the 
convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain 
injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the Supreme Court. Such 
legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter. 
In 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction 
proceedings upon institution of state court test cases. The essential 
ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial 
elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate 
orders. Three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions 
against collection of state taxes. This saved for state adjudication, 
in the first instance, the two major areas where federal injunctions 
had been most obnoxious, but other areas remained vulnerable.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, like Congress, showed misgivings 
concerning this aspect of government by injunction. Drawing upon 
the traditional discretion of the chancellor, Mr& Justice Holmes 
introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated 
in Mr& Justice Frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention. 
Whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability 
of adequate state remedies, the new emphasis is upon the nature of 
the state policy at issue. The classic case is <Railroad Commission> 
v& <Pullman>. The commission had issued an administrative order 
which was challenged as discriminatory against Negroes. Its enforcement 
was enjoined by a federal trial court. On review the Supreme 
Court, via Mr& Justice Frankfurter, found southern racial problems 
"a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought 
not to enter unless no alternative to **h adjudication is open". 
An alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether 
the offending order had in fact been authorized. Reluctant, as usual, 
to interpret state legislation- such interpretation can only be 
a "forecast rather than a determination"- Mr& Justice Frankfurter 
led a unanimous Court to vacate the injunction. But it is crucial 
that here, unlike <Burford>, the trial court was ordered to retain 
the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity 
to settle the state-law question. "The resources of equity are equal 
to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as 
well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication".

Temporary abstention, i&e&, postponement, is one thing; 
refusal to adjudicate is another. To the extent that the jurisdictional 
principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation, federal 
equitable relief against state action must be available- or so 
it seems to Mr& Justice Frankfurter. In <Alabama Public Service 
Commission> v& <Southern Ry& Co>&, the commission had 
refused to permit abandonment of certain "uneconomic" train facilities. 
The railroad, claiming deprivation of property without due process 
of law, sought injunctive relief. The Court held that federal 
jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state 
be obstructed; this in the name of equitable discretion. 
Justices Frankfurter and Jackson concurred in the Court's result, 
for they found no merit in the railroad's claim. But they objected 
vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise 
jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of Congress:   "By 
one fell swoop the Court now finds that Congress indulged in needless 
legislation in the acts of 1910, 1913, 1925, 1934 and 1937. By 
these measures, Congress, so the Court [in effect] now decides, gave 
not only needless but inadequate relief, since it now appears that 
the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the Act of 1875 against 
all proceedings challenging local regulation".   A most 
revealing recent case is <Textile Workers Union> v& <Lincoln 
Mills>. The Taft-Hartley Act gave the federal courts jurisdiction 
over "suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a 
labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce". 
On its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does 
not establish any law (rights) for the federal judges to enforce. How 
can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when Congress 
has created none? The Court held that Congress had intended 
the federal judiciary to "fashion" an appropriate law of labor-management 
contracts. In short, congressional power to grant federal-question 
authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that Congress 
need not create, or specify, the right to be enforced. 
The <Lincoln Mills> decision authorizes a whole new body of federal 
"common law" which, as Mr& Justice Frankfurter pointed out 
in dissent, leads to one of the following "incongruities": "(1) 
conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective 
bargaining agreements; (2) displacement of state law by federal law 
in state courts **h in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements; 
or (3) exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters". 
The Justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history 
of the provision in question suggests that Congress' purpose 
was merely to make unions <suable>. With a few exceptions, the lawmakers 
seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction 
involved- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges. 
To avoid these constitutional difficulties, Mr& Justice Frankfurter 
was prepared to read the Taft-Hartley provision as concerned 
with diversity, rather than federal question, jurisdiction. This 
would satisfy what presumably was Congress' major purpose- the suability 
of unions. It would also leave intact the states' traditional 
authority in the realm of contract law. (As we have seen, the <Erie> 
and <York> decisions require federal courts in diversity cases 
to follow state decisional rules.) Here again Mr& Justice Frankfurter 
could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial 
legislation. If Congress wants to displace the states from areas 
which they have customarily occupied, let it do so knowingly and explicitly. 
And let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal 
judges. Does <Lincoln Mills> suggest that if Congress granted jurisdiction 
over interstate divorce cases, the federal courts would be 
authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages?

There is a common problem behind most of these federal question 
and diversity cases. Congress has not clearly defined the bounds 
between state and federal court competence. It has the power to do 
so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on 
a case-by-case basis. A careful student has suggested that "In any 
new revision [of the Judicial Code] the legislators would do well 
to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should 
be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law 
might be used, leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation 
of pronouncing state law". Obviously, the goal here proposed is the 
guiding principle in Mr& Justice Frankfurter's opinions- to 
the extent that Congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion. 
The same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in 
the ~FELA <certiorari> cases, in the administrative law area, 
and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review. Mr& Justice Black 
no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to 
achieve a generous and "just" result. He will not be "fooled 
by technicalities". 

#FEDERAL REVIEW OF STATE DECISIONS#

With few 
exceptions, Congress has not given federal courts <exclusive> authority 
to enforce rights arising under federal law. To put it differently, 
state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect 
to most claims of federal right. To insure uniformity in the meaning 
of national law, however, state interpretations are subject to Supreme 
Court review. It may be noted, parenthetically, that to evade 
"desegregation" 
an ex-Justice and former southern governor has urged 
Congress to abolish this reviewing authority. The result, of course, 
would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in 
different states. It would also probably mean different things within 
the same state- depending upon what court (state or federal) rendered 
decision.   We consider here only a few of many problems involved 
in this crucial federal-state relationship. The first is that enforcement 
of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old 
diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance. Subject to 
certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials, each level 
of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures. Litigants 
who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that 
court subject to its rules of procedure. A similar canon applies to those 
who press state claims in federal tribunals, e&g&, in diversity 
cases. In an ~FELA 
controversy the state court followed established state procedure 
by construing a vague complaint "most strongly against" the complainant. 
In other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon 
the pleader by state law. The result was that the plaintiff's case 
was dismissed. Mr& Justice Black led a reversing majority: "Strict 
local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens 
upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law". Here, as 
in the <Byrd> case, another element of state procedure was subsumed 
to federal judge-made law. Justices Frankfurter and Jackson dissented: 
"One State may cherish formalities more than another, one 
State may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms. If 
a litigant chooses to enforce a Federal right in a State court, he 
cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who 
press like claims arising under State law with regard to the form 
in which the claim must be stated- the particularity, for instance, 
with which a cause of action must be described. Federal law, though invoked 
in a State court, delimits the Federal claim- defines what 
gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it. But the form in 
which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the State 
exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it, so long 
as a requirement does not add to, or diminish, the right as defined 
by Federal law, nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities 
of litigation".   Another problem in the area of federal-state 
relationships is this: what constitutes reversible error in 
a state decision? <Terminiello> v& <Chicago> involved a conviction 
for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance. The conduct 
in question was a speech. The accused did not object to the trial court's 
charge to the jury that discourse "may constitute a breach of 
the peace if it stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about 
a condition of unrest **h". For present purposes it may be assumed 
that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal 
Constitution. Though the accused raised many other objections, he 
did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings. 
That is, he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his 
case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right. 
How else can one explain, for example, allowing the survival of the right 
to amortize bond discount and premium (section 381(c)(9)), but not 
the right to amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction 
for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization 
(section 381(c)(16)), but not a deduction for theft losses 
sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered 
after it; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depeciation 
(section 381(c)(6)), but not allowing rapid amortization of 
emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization; or allowing survival 
of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company (section 
381(c)(14)), but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes?

These items, and most of the others listed above, seem 
quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 
381. There does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction 
either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of 
tax-avoidance possibilities. With respect to items such as these the 
provisions of section 381(c), viewed in historical perspective, suggest 
a rule requiring survival, whether the items are beneficial or detrimental 
to the surviving corporation. To this extent some stretching 
of the literal meaning of the Committee Report seems justified, since 
the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication, if not the 
language, of the statute.   It is not contended that section 
381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes. 
Such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction 
of the statute alone; it would certainly violate the intention of 
Congress as expressed in the Committee Report; and in at least 
one instance, involving refund claims, it might be contrary to another 
provision of the United States Code. 

#REFUND CLAIMS#

Section 
203 of the United States Code voids an assignment of a claim against 
the Government unless made after it has been allowed, the amount due 
has been ascertained, and a warrant for its payment has been issued. 
If it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions, this 
section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for 
taxes paid by a transferor corporation, even though the reorganization 
meets the requirements of section 381(a).   A clearly recognized 
exception is a statutory merger or consolidation. The leading case, 
<Seaboard Air Line Railway v& United States,> held that 
the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor, 
and it has been consistently followed. The Court said the purpose 
of the section was principally to spare the Government the embarrassment 
and trouble of dealing with several parties, one of them a stranger 
to the claim, and to prevent traffic in claims, particularly tenuous 
claims, against the Government. Neither reason, said the Court, applied 
to the case at hand; furthermore, Congress could not be presumed 
to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states. Other 
exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors, corporate dissolutions, 
transfers by descent, or transfers by subrogation. Exceptions 
are often classified as transfers by "operation of law".

A tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation 
statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an "operation 
of law" mold. Although it is in some ways comparable to 
a voluntary sale of assets for cash, to which section 203 quite clearly 
applies, the courts and Treasury have held that acquiring corporations 
in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund 
of taxes paid by transferors. A recent case in point is <Mitchell 
Canneries v& United States,> in which a claim against the Government 
was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership, whose 
partners were former stockholders, and then to another corporation formed 
by the partners. Holding the final corporation entitled to sue on 
the claim, the Court cited the <Seaboard, Novo Trading,> and <Roomberg> 
cases for the proposition that "**h transfers by operation 
of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are not 
assignments prohibited by the statute".   In an earlier case, 
<Kingan + Co& v& United States,> an American corporation 
was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a British corporation 
in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the British 
corporation. The anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the 
American corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the British 
corporation. The transaction presumably would have qualified under 
section 368(a)(1)(B) as a contractual reorganization, followed 
by a section 332 liquidation, but not under section 368(a)(1)(A) 
as a statutory merger of consolidation. The Court, nevertheless, relied 
on the <Seaboard> case and also mentioned that the shareholders 
of the two corporations were the same. In substance, said the Court, 
there was no transfer of equitable title.   The Treasury arrives 
at substantially the same conclusion, but skirts the problem of section 
203 of the United States Code. Revenue Ruling 54-17 provides 
that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been 
liquidated by merger with a successor corporation, a claim for refund 
should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the 
corporation which paid the tax, followed by the name of the successor 
corporation. Proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also 
be filed. If the succession is a matter of public record, certificates 
of the Secretaries of State or other public officials having custody 
of the documents will suffice; if the succession is not of record, 
all documents relating to such succession, properly certified, are 
required. The former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger 
or consolidation, the latter to a contractual acquisition. The Ruling 
would not, however, apply to an acquisition of assets for cash. A recent 
Ruling, although rather confusing, cites and follows Rev& Rul& 
54-17. The Ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory 
or contractual reorganization. Hence, a successor corporation 
in a ~C reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes 
paid by the merged corporation despite section 203.   In a ~B 
reorganization, followed by a section 332 liquidation, those cases 
which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation 
appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes 
paid by the transferor. In fact, a cash purchase of a corporation's 
stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer 
a claim for refund if the <Kimbell-Diamond> doctrine is not 
applied to eliminate the intermediate step.   These results appear 
sound. As stated in <Seaboard> and numerous other cases, the two 
primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the United States 
Code were to prevent the Government from having to deal with more 
than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims 
on a contingent-fee basis. The cases have allowed transfer of claims 
if beneficial ownership is not changed. The first reason would never 
apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 
381(a), which is the only type presently under discussion. Section 
381(a) applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary 
owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent, a statutory merger or consolidation, 
an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets 
solely in exchange for voting stock, or a change of identity, form, 
or place of organization. In virtually every case the transferor corporation 
is liquidated, and its former stockholders either own outright, 
or have a continuing stock interest in, the assets which gave rise 
to the tax. In these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting 
claims is exceedingly remote. Furthermore, in a ~C reorganization 
the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation 
which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger, 
to which the statute is clearly inapplicable.   Nor is it 
at all likely that a "desperate" claim against the Government will 
be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization. 
If the transferor has substantial assets other than the 
claim, it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to 
acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim 
for refund of taxes. If such an unlikely transaction were to take place, 
it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase, followed 
by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary, followed 
by liquidation. In the rare case where a corporation's only 
substantial asset, or its most important one, is a claim for refund, perhaps 
its transfer should not be permitted, whether the reorganization 
takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets 
for stock.   It appears, then, that although the matter is not 
dealt with in section 381(c), a successor corporation in a reorganization 
of a type specified in section 381(a) is entitled to sue for refund 
of taxes paid by a transferor corporation. Section 203 of the United 
States Code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against 
the Government transferred in tax-free reorganizations. The successor 
corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims. 

#OTHER 
TAX ATTRIBUTES OF THE TRANSFEROR#

There are certain tax attributes 
of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts 
of the particular reorganization involved. For example, property "used 
in the trade or business" of a transferor corporation, as defined 
in section 1231, presumably would not retain its special status following 
a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business 
of the acquiring corporation. The parent of a group filing consolidated 
returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization 
defined in section 368(a)(1)(F), but as a different corporation 
for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation 
which had not, for example, elected to file consolidated returns 
with its own subsidiaries. Similar considerations presumably made 
it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring 
corporations have different methods of accounting (section 381(c)(4)) 
or depreciation (section 381(c)(6)).   Other sections 
of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code provide for survival of certain of 
a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization. 
Section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis 
for property transferred, and section 1223 provides for tacking on 
the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee. 
Section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities 
to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period. However, 
a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for 
a person acquiring emergency facilities. _ATTRIBUTES SIMILAR TO A LOSS 
CARRYOVER._ There may be certain items which are quite similar 
to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right 
to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions 
applicable to those items. For example, suppose another excess profits 
tax similar to prior laws is enacted, providing for carryover of 
excess profits credits. This carryover right has a number of things in 
common with a net operating loss carryover. It is an averaging device 
intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income; it is a tax 
benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects 
to have a high excess profits tax. Under the 1939 Code this item 
was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the <Stanton 
Brewery> case, but only over the dissent of Judge Learned Hand, 
who wrote the majority opinion in the <Sansome> case, a leading case 
requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization.

Since this type of item was not in the statute when 
section 381 was enacted in 1954, one cannot say with certainty what effect 
the enactment of that section should have. With respect to this 
type of item, one might properly apply the language of the Committee 
Report, quoted above, which cautions against using section 381 as a 
basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein. 
Actually, there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable 
to a net operating loss carryover. Probably the primary reason 
for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique 
opportunity it presents for tax avoidance. 

#A. REASONS FOR SELECTING MAIL QUESTIONNAIRE METHOD#

There were two 
methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the 
resources available: (1) interviews in depth with a few selected 
companies, and (2) the more limited interrogation of a large number of 
companies by means of a mail questionnaire.   While the method 
of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the 
opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and 
circumstances of a company's practices and opinions, it also involved 
the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems 
of just a few individual companies. As a result, it was decided that 
a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more 
effective in determining the general practices and opinions of 
small 
firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems 
of defense procurement that concern both industry and government. 
It was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest 
fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more 
detailed nature.   It is recognized that a mail questionnaire 
has inherent limitations. There is the danger that the questions will 
mean different things to different respondents. Simple "yes" or 
"no" answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the 
various respondents may have. A respondent may want to make alternative 
answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed 
in the question. There is also the problem of the respondent's frame 
of reference. Is the respondent making a recommendation for his own 
benefit, for the benefit of his industry, for the benefit of a specific 
government department or service, for the benefit of the defense 
program, for the benefit of small business, or for the benefit of the 
taxpayers?   There is also the question of whether the respondent 
based his answers on factual information and carefully considered 
judgment, or whether his answers were casual guesses. Finally, there 
is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held- whether 
it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly 
over the alternatives.   The research team was very mindful of 
these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire. Under the circumstances, 
however, the team considered it would provide the most useful 
information at this point. In the preparation of the questionnaire 
the problems noted above were carefully considered, and the structure 
and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these 
limitations. 

#B. DESIGN OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE#

The questionnaire was 
designed to elicit three types of information: (1) the facts regarding 
certain characteristics of the respondents, including their experience 
with, and interest in, securing defense business; (2) the actual 
selling and buying practices of the respondents; and (3) the attitudes 
and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and 
the methods of awarding defense contracts. It was hoped that the facts 
concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would 
offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the 
recommendations which they did.   The major sections of the questionnaire 
(see Appendix ~B) are devoted to the following: 
_1._ 
Information for classifying respondents (Part ~A of the questionnaire) 
_2._ Characteristics of defense sales activities (Part ~B 
of the questionnaire) _3._ Respondents' practices in participating 
in advertised bidding for defense business (Part ~C of the 
questionnaire) _4._ Respondents' practices in participating in 
negotiated bidding for defense purposes (Part ~D of the questionnaire) 
_5._ Respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding 
(Part ~E of the questionnaire) _6._ Respondents' opinions regarding 
negotiated bidding (Part ~F of the questionnaire) _7._ 
Respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense 
contracts (Part ~G of the questionnaire)   The questionnaire 
provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification 
of the respondent was optional. The questionnaire also stated 
that, in any event, all replies would be treated confidentially. 
It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the 
questionnaire identified themselves. 

#C. PREPARATION AND PRETEST OF 
THE QUESTIONNAIRE# 

The research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire 
over a period of six months. In June, 1960, an early draft 
of the questionnaire, along with a cover letter, was mailed to fourteen 
companies in the state of Washington. Several days after the companies 
had received the questionnaire, members of the research team contacted 
the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone 
to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have 
experienced in completing the questionnaire. This test resulted in 
further revisions of the questionnaire.   The research team was 
concerned that responses from firms in the state of Washington might 
not be typical of those throughout the country, or that the results might 
be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made. Accordingly, 
another test of the questionaire was made. The revised draft 
was mailed in July, 1960, to 100 firms throughout the United States. 
Fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3,500 names 
submitted by member companies of the Aerospace Industries Association 
(~AIA list) and fifty were selected in a similar manner from 
a list of 1,500 names compiled by the research team from the Thomas 
Register (~TR list). The method of compiling the ~AIA and 
~TR lists will be described later.   Ten days after the questionnaires 
were mailed, follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging 
those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do 
so at once. Twenty-eight returns in all were received. The responses 
were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions 
that were apparently not understood by the respondent. The cover 
letter, questionnaire, and follow-up postcard were then revised into 
final form (see Appendixes ~A, ~B, and ~C. 

#D. COMPILATION 
OF MAILING LISTS#

The objective of the study was to determine the 
opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs. The 
firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective 
in mind.   Three lists of companies were made and used in the 
study.   The first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies 
located in the state of Washington which were personally known to 
the research team to be active in defense work. The primary consideration 
in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the 
questionnaire with company officers.   The second list was derived 
from a group of approximately 8,000 names supplied to the research 
team by the Aerospace Industries Association. These names were secured 
from member companies by the Association from the forty-four sources 
listed in Appendix ~F. Each source selected from its approved 
bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses 
that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems. 
Where possible, the name of an executive was supplied along with 
the company name and address.   The forty-four lists supplied 
by the ~AIA member companies were merged and duplicate names were 
eliminated. There was further elimination of all companies that were 
not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive. The 
remaining names were then checked against the Thomas Register list 
(see below) and duplicate names were removed from the ~AIA lists. 
By these steps the final ~AIA list was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500.

The third list was selected by the research team on a random 
basis from the Thomas Register. It was compiled as a control sample 
to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the 
lists 
submitted by the members of the Aerospace industries Association 
were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense 
programs. Such a difference might have resulted from: _1._ 
The fact that the Aerospace Industries Association members whose 
lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs. 
_2._ The fact that companies on the ~AIA lists were already 
participating in the defense program because of the manner of their 
selection. Accordingly, as "in-group", they might have different 
opinions 
and practices than an "out-group" composed of those companies 
not so participating but interested in defense business. _3._ 
The fact that ~AIA lists might not have been selected on a random 
basis.   The control sample was selected by taking the bottom 
name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical 
listing of manufacturers in the Thomas Register. If the bottom 
name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified, 
the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was 
substituted. Fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion. 

#E. 
MAILING THE QUESTIONNAIRE#

Each questionnaire was mailed with a 
cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive 
of each firm. The questionnaires were mailed in Seattle, Washington, 
and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of Idaho, Montana, 
Oregon, and Washington. Airmail was used for the addresses outside 
the Pacific Northwest.   Each letter contained a postage-prepaid 
return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the Pacific 
Northwest, and by airmail for those outside the Pacific Northwest. 
Approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed, a 
follow-up 
airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names.   The 
first test mailing (to 14 companies) was made in June, 1960. The second 
test mailing (to 100 companies) was made in July, 1960. The final 
mailing of the questionnaire was made late in August, 1960, to 4,900 
firms consisting of 3,450 from the ~AIA list and 1,450 from the 
~TR list. 

#F. 
RETURNS RECEIVED#

Over 1,000 returns were received 
within two weeks after the final mailing was made. They continued 
to arrive until the end of December, 1960, by which time a total of 
1,343 returns were received representing 26.8 per cent of the 5,014 
questionnaires 
sent out. Fifty-seven returns could not be used because 
they were incomplete or received too late to be processed. The remaining 
1,286 returns that were processed came from the categories in Table 
2. 

#G. PROCESSING THE RETURNS#

Each questionnaire was audited 
for obvious mistakes and for comments, and was identified by a serial 
number, by the source list from which the company name was selected, 
and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark 
on the return envelope. All responses, except comments, were 
numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment. The codes 
were key-punched 
into ~IBM punch cards and verified. Each return 
required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns. 
In order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company 
each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified 
with the appropriate serial number of the respondent. The cards were 
then processed using standard ~IBM punch card equipment, including 
an ~IBM 650 computer.   The first step in processing was 
to analyze the returns from Questions 1, 2, and 3 to determine 
whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses, in 
accordance with the definitions contained in ~ASPR Section 1-701. 
(see Chapter /2,). The results are shown in Table 3. 
The returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside 
and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions 
and practices of small firms.   The second step in processing 
was to compare the responses from companies on the ~AIA list with 
those from companies on the ~TR list in order to determine whether 
it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of 
the study. The methods and results of this comparative analysis are 
described in Appendix ~H. It was concluded that it would be appropriate 
to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all 
small businesses engaged in, or wishing to sell to, defense programs. 
In the first place, the two groups of firms, when combined, had characteristics 
and practices that were more representative of companies 
that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the ~AIA 
list alone.

THE vast Central Valley of California is one of the most 
productive agricultural areas in the world. During the summer of 1960, 
it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle.

The contestants in this economic struggle are the Agricultural 
Workers Organizing Committee (~AWOC) of the ~AFL-~CIO 
and the agricultural employers of the State. By virtue of 
the legal responsibilities of the Department of Employment in the 
farm placement program, we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between 
these two forces. It is not a pleasant or easy position, but one 
we have endeavored to maintain. We have sought to be strictly neutral 
as between the parties, but at the same time we have been required 
frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose.

Inevitably, one side was pleased and the other displeased, regardless 
of how we ruled. Often the displeased parties interpreted our decision 
as implying favoritism toward the other. We have consoled ourselves 
with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one 
of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding. It 
is disconcerting, nevertheless, to read in a labor weekly, "Perluss 
knuckles down to growers", and then to be confronted with a growers' 
publication which states, "Perluss recognizes obviously phony and 
trumped-up strikes as bona fide".   For a number of years, 
there have been sporadic attempts in California to organize farm workers. 
These attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons. 
They were inadequately financed, without experienced leadership, and 
lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole. This past 
year the pattern has been different: The organizing program had the 
full support of the ~AFL-~CIO, which supplied staff and money 
to the ~AWOC, as well as moral support. Leadership was experienced 
and skillful, and financial resources were significant. Regardless 
of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties, failure 
to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts 
of life.   As a result of these changed conditions, the impact 
of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations 
has been much greater than in the past. The ~AWOC has been able 
to employ the traditional weapons of labor- the strike and the 
picket 
line- with considerable success, particularly in the area of wages.

By the very nature of the situation, it is the union which 
has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management. 
To date, at least, the strategy of the ~AWOC has been 
selective; that is to say, to concentrate on a particular crop or activity 
in a particular area at a strategic time, rather than any broadside 
engagement with management throughout an area or the State.

Primarily, we became involved in these disputes because of our referral 
obligations under our farm placement program. Normally, because 
agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance, we would 
not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade 
dispute provision of the Unemployment Insurance Code, although 
such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility. But the current 
issues arose out of the Wagner-Peyser Act concerning referrals 
to an establishment where a labor dispute exists, and out of Public 
Law 78 and the Migrant Labor Agreement if Mexican nationals were 
employed at the ranch.   Most of us remember and think of the Wagner-Peyser 
Act in its historical sense, as a major milestone in the 
development of public placement services. Infrequently do we think 
of it as a living, continuing, operating control over the system. However, 
when labor disputes arise, its provisions come clearly into play. 
California has accepted the provisions of that Act (as have all other 
States) by enacting into our Code (Section 2051) a provision that

<The State of California accepts the provisions of the 
Wagner-Peyser Act, **h and will observe and comply with the requirements 
of that act>.   With respect to labor disputes, the Wagner-Peyser 
Act states only,   <In carrying out the provisions 
of this Act, the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for 
the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they 
are referred to employment>.

Other provisions of the Act empower 
the Secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions, 
and he has done so. The pertinent regulation for our purposes 
is Section 602.2 (~b), as follows:   Referrals in labor 
dispute situations. <No person shall be referred to a position the 
filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which 
(1) is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked 
out in the course of a labor dispute, or (2) the filling of which 
is an issue in a labor dispute. With respect to positions not covered 
by subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph, any individual may be 
referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists, provided 
he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time 
of his referral>.   In analyzing this regulation, let us take 
the last sentence first. It permits referrals under certain circumstances 
even when there is a labor dispute, provided the individual is 
given written notice of such a dispute. Assume, for example, a situation 
where a farm has a packing shed and fields. The packing shed workers 
go on strike. There is no dispute involving fieldwork. We concluded 
that we may refer workers to the fieldwork (but not the packing shed 
work) provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute. 
So far, no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision.

It is the first part of the Regulation that is currently at issue. 
Note that it <prohibits> referrals under either condition (1) 
or condition (2). Employer representatives have contended that the Secretary 
has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition, on the 
grounds that the Wagner-Peyser Act requires only written notice to 
the prospective worker that a dispute exists. 

#INTO COURT#

The matter 
got into the courts this way: One of the early strikes called 
by the ~AWOC was at the DiGiorgio pear orchards in Yuba County. 
We found that a labor dispute existed, and that the workers had left 
their jobs, which were then vacant because of the dispute. Accordingly, 
under clause (1) of the Secretary's Regulation, we suspended 
referrals to the employer. (Incidentally, no Mexican nationals were 
involved.) The employer, seeking to continue his harvest, challenged 
our right to cease referrals to him, and sought relief in the Superior 
Court of Yuba County. The court issued a temporary restraining 
order, directing us to resume referrals. We, of course, obeyed the court 
order. However, the Attorney General of California, at the request 
of the Secretary of Labor, sought to have the jurisdiction over 
the issue removed to the Federal District Court, on grounds that 
it was predominantly a Federal issue since the validity of the Secretary's 
Regulation was being challenged. However, the Federal Court 
held that since the State had accepted the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser 
Act into its own Code, and presumably therefore also the 
regulations, it was now a State matter. It accordingly refused to assume 
jurisdiction, whereupon the California Superior Court made the 
restraining order permanent. Under that order, we have continued referring 
workers to the ranch. A similar case arose at the Bowers ranch 
in Butte County, and the Superior Court of that county issued similar 
restraining orders.   The growers have strenuously argued 
that I should have accepted the Superior Court decisions as conclusive 
and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision 
in the Secretary's Regulation. I cannot accept that view, 
either as a lawyer or as an administrator. 

#LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS# 

First, let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved. 
It is an accepted juridical principle in California that a Superior 
Court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent. It 
is conclusive, unless appealed, only upon the particular parties to 
the particular action which was heard. It is not binding upon another 
Superior Court, which could rule to the contrary. Only when a decision 
is rendered by the District Court of Appeal (or, of course, the 
Supreme Court) is a binding precedent established. In that event, 
we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation 
of the matter, and one which we can follow statewide with confidence 
that the policy will not be overthrown in other Superior Courts.

But over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent 
decision, I am convinced that the decisions of the Superior Courts 
which in effect nullify the Secretary's Regulation are not a 
correct interpretation of the Secretary's power under the Federal 
law. I believe I am in good company in this view. The Attorney General 
of California concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal 
from these decisions to the District Court of Appeal. The Attorney 
General of the United States, in considering the power of the 
Secretary to issue similar regulations under the Wagner-Peyser Act 
relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers, has rendered 
an opinion sustaining his authority. Further, and as an evidence of 
legislative intent only, the Senate of the United States recently 
defeated by a substantial majority the "Holland Amendment" to the 
Fair Labor Standards Act, which would have specifically limited 
the regulatory authority of the Secretary in these matters.   Next, 
let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications 
of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals.   There is far 
too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter 
hanging in midair. The ramifications of the issue are enormous. A 
decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have 
to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations, and might in 
effect place the public employment services in the position of acting 
as strikebreakers. The public interest is so dominant in such an issue 
that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative 
order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action 
in one or two Superior Courts in the State. It is an issue which 
may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial 
finality is achieved.   As an administrator, I cannot place 
the Employment Service in California in jeopardy of being out of compliance 
with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of 
appeal open to me. To have applied statewide the decisions of the two 
cases heard in Superior Court, in my opinion, would have placed us 
clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have 
immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor, were he so 
inclined, to notify the Governor of such noncompliance, set a date for 
hearing, and issue his finding. The impact of noncompliance under 
the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million 
a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service 
program or, as a corollary, the taking over by the Federal Government 
of its operation.   Thus far, the cases which have come before 
the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is 
vacant due to a strike- condition (1) in the Regulation of the Secretary. 
None has yet arisen under condition (2), relating to referral 
to jobs "the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute".

Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word "filling". 
Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements 
as job specifications, union membership, union jurisdiction, and 
the like? Or should it have a broader connotation of including wage 
demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the 
mechanics of "filling" the job.   Because of the uncertainty 
of this definition, I solicited the interpretation of the Secretary 
of Labor. He has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the 
proper one; that is, that if wages, for example, is the only issue 
in a labor dispute, and no workers have left their jobs because of the 
dispute, we may continue to make referrals. 
_9._ Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young 
children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual 
level simply by combining objects and counting them. After they 
have developed concepts, they are free from the necessity of manipulating 
objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely. 
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age. One 
experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between 
the eleventh and twelfth years. _10._ Many studies indicate that 
elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science; 
that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes 
and events; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities 
change and broaden. _EMOTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS_ How a child 
feels about himself, about other people, and about the tasks confronting 
him in school may have as much influence on his success in school 
as his physical and intellectual characteristics. A considerable amount 
of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not 
likely to do well in school subjects. Emotional maturity is the result 
of many factors, the principal ones being the experiences of the 
first few years of the child's life. However, the teacher who understands 
the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential 
in helping pupils gain confidence, security, and satisfaction. 
Concerning this responsibility of the teacher, suggestions for helping 
children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 
11. The following generalizations about the emotional characteristics 
of elementary-school children may be helpful. _1._ Typically, 
the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short 
time, as contrasted to those of an adult. _2._ As the child grows 
older, his emotional reactions lead to "moods", or emotional states 
drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly, rather than in 
short, abrupt outbursts. _3._ Studies of the growth and decline 
of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects, noises, 
falling, and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years, 
but that fears of the dark, of being alone, and of imaginary creatures 
or robbers increase. _4._ Ridiculing a child for being afraid 
or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing 
with the problem; more effective solutions include explanations, 
the example of another child, or conditioning by associating the feared 
object, place, or person with something pleasant. _5._ Children 
need help in learning to control their emotions. The young child 
learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums, screaming, kicking, 
and hitting will not get him what he wants; the older child learns 
that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers, 
and, therefore, makes a real effort to control his emotions. _6._ 
Children differ widely in their emotional responses. Among infants 
the patterns of emotional responses are similar; as the influence 
of learning and environment are felt, emotional behavior becomes individualized. 
_SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS_ Although no national norms exist 
for the social development of children, the teacher can find a great 
deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed 
by children at various age levels. The following summary will 
give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school 
children; the student will certainly want to explore more 
deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals, struggling 
to meet their developmental needs, and at the same time trying to learn 
the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which 
they hold membership. _1._ During early childhood, children 
are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than 
they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in 
school a few years, their interest in playmates of their own age increases, 
and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once 
considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family 
gatherings now considers it a bore. In late childhood the influence 
of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase; 
the group sets the styles in clothing, the kind of play engaged in, 
and the ideals of right and wrong behavior. _2._ In early childhood 
the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his 
own age or a year or two older, who can do the things he likes to do; 
such factors as sex, intelligence, and status in the group do not 
influence his choice much at this time. _3._ In later childhood, 
an interest in team games replaces individual play; loyalty to the group, 
a feeling of superiority over those who are not members, and unwillingness 
to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits. 
_4._ During early childhood boys tease and bully, on the average, 
more than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in 
these activities more than do well-adjusted children. _5._ During 
late childhood boys like to tease, jostle, and talk smart to girls; 
girls, who are more mature than boys, frown upon the youthful antics 
of boys of their own age. _6._ By the time pupils reach the sixth 
grade, their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed; 
they exhibit a keen interest in social, political, and economic problems, 
but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the 
terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work. _7._ Between 
the ages of two and four years, negativism or resistance to adult 
authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to decline. 
However, as we have seen, in later childhood the child begins to 
substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers. 
_8._ The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability 
to work in groups. The child in the primary grades can play harmoniously 
with one companion, but his desire to be first in everything 
gets him into trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be with 
people, but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate. In the middle grades, 
however, he begins to participate more effectively in group activities 
such as selecting a leader, helping to make plans and carry on 
group activities, and setting up rules governing the enterprise. 

#WHY 
THE TEACHER SHOULD STUDY THE INDIVIDUAL PUPIL#

Much progress has 
been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding 
children, yet in almost any classroom today can be found children 
whose needs are not being met by the school program. Some are failing 
to achieve as much as their ability would permit; others never 
seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom. These children 
have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults 
who did not understand.   Many school systems now employ school 
psychologists and child guidance specialists. These specialists 
perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children 
who need special attention, by suggesting ways of meeting the needs 
of individual children in the regular classroom, and by providing clinical 
services for severely maladjusted children. It is the classroom 
teacher, however, who has daily contacts with pupils, and who is in a 
unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice. 
Indeed, a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work 
of the elementary-school teacher, rather than merely an additional 
chore.   Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools 
have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the 
basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals. 
What they should recognize is that children who have been placed 
in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely 
in attributes that influence success, and that they still must be 
treated as individuals. Although the teacher must be concerned with 
maintaining standards, he must also be concerned about understanding 
differences in ability, background, and experience. _FACTORS THAT INHIBIT 
LEARNING AND LEAD TO MALADJUSTMENT_ Studies conducted in various 
sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary 
schools are maladjusted emotionally, and that many of them are 
failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects. One study, 
which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six, found that 12 percent 
of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading 
a year below capacity. It is apparent, therefore, that the teacher 
needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and 
adjustment of children. When a child fails to meet the standards of 
the school in his rate of learning, insecurity, unhappiness, and other 
forms of maladjustment frequently follow. These maladjustments in 
turn inhibit learning, and a vicious cycle is completed.   It is 
easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving 
in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy, or that the 
child who lacks interest in school, who dislikes the teacher, or who 
is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent. The causes of retardation 
and maladjustment may be found in physical factors, such as defective 
speech or hearing, impaired vision, faulty motor coordination, a frail 
constitution, chronic disease, malnutrition, and glandular malfunctioning. 
They may be caused by poor health habits, such as faulty eating 
and sleeping habits. They may be related to mental immaturity or lack 
of aptitude for certain types of school work. The curriculum may 
be too difficult for some and too easy for others. Teaching methods, 
learning materials, and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead 
to maladjustments for some children. Unwholesome family relations, 
broken homes, and undesirable community influences may also be contributing 
factors. This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit 
learning and contribute to maladjustment among children. Moreover, 
these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner. A 
vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading 
disability 
for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement 
in reading. An impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute 
the motivation causing another to work harder for successful 
achievement in school. At any rate, the teacher who recognizes common 
causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal 
to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement, failure, and maladjustment. 

#SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN#

Successful teaching 
involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand 
why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement 
in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment. 
The classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the 
use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist; 
he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information 
needed about each child in his classroom. He can be expected, 
however, to examine and interpret the information already available; 
to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children; 
and to utilize opportunities, arising in connection with regular 
classroom activities, for gaining a better understanding of his 
pupils. This section deals with some of the sources of information that 
can be tapped by the classroom teacher; Chapter 15 provides more 
detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil 
progress. _CUMULATIVE RECORDS_ Most school systems today maintain 
a system of cumulative records of pupils. These records, when systematically 
maintained, provide much information about the children, which 
the teacher can use in guidance, instruction, grouping, and reporting 
to parents. Each teacher has in his classroom a metal file, equipped 
with a lock, which is used to store cumulative record folders. During 
summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of 
the principal. Only the teacher and other professional personnel are 
permitted to see or use these records. Each new teacher to whom the 
pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record 
and to bring it up to date. Some school systems provide written instructions 
to principals and teachers designating when certain information 
is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how 
the information is to be summarized and used.

THE SUMMARY REPORT ON DESEGREGATION PROGRESS IN EDUCATION IN 
THE MIDDLE-SOUTH REGION, 1959-1960" clearly shows two pieces of 
information. The Summary Report, which was prepared for this Conference, 
indicates, first, that actual or pending school desegregation is 
increasing; second, that both actual and pending desegregation is, 
with few exceptions, the product or result of court order. The Report 
together with other information suggests that desegregation in the 
schools is slow.   The Middle-South Region, as defined by the 
National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials (~NAIRO), 
consists of the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, West 
Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia. The 
states and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation, in 
fact some dating back to 1954; but the region also embraces some of 
the staunchest opposition. Desegregation has been opposed by massive 
resistance, interposition, pupil assignment (with no assignments of 
Negro children), and hate bombings. 

#DESEGREGATION AND COURT ORDER# 

Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation 
and such increase as a result of court order. First <Kentucky>. 
Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties, 
which already had high school desegregation. The action was a result 
of a court order, the citation for which (and for other court action 
mentioned in this paper) is taken from the Summary Report for this 
Conference. In <Maryland> the Harford County Board of Education 
had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but 
which a plaintiff had challenged; thus, county school board and Federal 
court joined hands here to promote school desegregation.   Additional 
school desegregation in <Tennessee> resulted from a court 
order opening a school serving children of military personnel. Similarly, 
further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee 
cities, Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis. In <West Virginia> 
the number of white and Negro children attending the same school 
has increased almost twofold. There are no court decisions here.

As in Maryland, a District court has approved an official plan 
of school desegregation in <Delaware>. As a result of the State 
Board of Education plan, Negro children entered heretofore white 
elementary schools in five districts. The Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan.   In <Virginia> 
court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties. 
Desegregation in Pulaski County is pending because of court 
order, although date of admission is not yet determined. Negro parents 
have filed application for admission of additional children to schools 
in Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, and Warren Counties. Desegregation 
can also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs 
against school boards in Newport News, Fairfax County, Arlington 
County, and Norfolk.   As a school district, the <District 
of Columbia> has had desegregated schools since 1954, shortly 
after the Supreme Court decision.   This recapitulation makes 
it clear that school desegregation continues, including the Old Dominion 
State, in spite of its stern resistance. The record is clear that 
increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result 
of a court order; that on the immediate horizon, if further large-scale 
(relatively speaking) desegregation comes, it will result from court 
orders on suits filed in several Middle-South states. Knowledge 
that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that 
school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads 
to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow. 
Before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at 
this Regional Conference, I wish to note a small item in the Summary 
Report as it refers to the District of Columbia. That reference 
in the Report is "continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro 
school system", a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of Negro 
school population from 74.1 per cent to 76.7 per cent. I see no 
real prospects for an all-Negro school population. West of Rock Creek 
Park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white 
as a result of Georgetown's conversion-by-renovation housing program. 
Nearby Foggy Bottom is ousting Negroes. The large acreage 
in the Southwest Redevelopment area beckons white people- what with 
high-priced town houses and elevator apartments. The Capitol Hill 
rehabilitation, like Foggy Bottom, replaces Negroes with whites (but 
also replaces some whites with other whites).   The sharpest 
break with tradition, the past and present of "White Ring Around 
a Black Core", may come with the opening of nearby Montgomery County 
suburbs to Negro residents and, presumably, the consequent conclusion 
of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to 
the suburbs. In fact, short of fleeing to Warrenton, Virginia, or Rockville, 
Maryland, white people may have to live with Negroes. All 
of this must be taken into account before the image of an "all-Negro" 
D&C& public school system is conjured up. 

#PROBLEMS TO 
SOLVE#

From the Summary Report before us at this Conference, a number 
of problems are apparent. They vex us and perplex us but generally 
do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems. 
First, how can we step up the desegregation movement? It is slow. 
I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together 
can and do attend. I believe we all want no child denied admission to 
a school on account of his color. In general, members of ~NAIRO 
would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence 
or within his residence zone. How to achieve this objective is 
a problem, but we are not divided on what we want.   Second, as 
we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves, 
how can we achieve this action through school board action? 
It may be county school board or state school board action, as well 
as that of municipal school boards. Correlatively, can we reduce the 
role of the district courts, so that the action is that of the people 
of the community or other school district and not that of the law court? 
This is a problem, and I believe there is little difference of 
opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and 
effect a plan of desegregation.   Third, how can we insure a systematic 
and continuing group relations education in the schools? Not 
simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but 
a continuing program that also promotes integration, that encourages 
the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro, 
but as human beings. Again the problem is how to get it done and 
in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it 
should be done.   Fourth, in the segregated school system, during 
the period before desegregation, how can we assure equal opportunity? 
In fact, in the desegregated school system which may have a good 
many schools with all-Negro population, how can we assure equal opportunity? 
This is a problem, but we are not divided over its importance 
or by its existence.   Fifth, in the segregated school system 
or in the all-Negro or all-white schools, how can we encourage better 
group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong 
to the group? Can we help children adjust to "images of other 
children" when the latter are not actually present. 

#NOW, THE ISSUES# 

If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively 
united fashion, then there are twice as many issues which, I judge, sharply 
divide us, intergroup relations practitioners and lay people. _ISSUE 
NO& 1. PUPIL ASSIGNMENT._ Since on the one hand school 
desegregation 
has come in Virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment, shall 
we support the plan? On the basis of pupil assignment criteria, 
Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children to formerly white 
schools in Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia. Shall we support pupil 
assignment? On the other hand, looking at the larger picture, 
is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off, blocked, or 
reduced school desegregation to a "trickle"? Shall we therefore 
oppose the plan? This question is an issue because it likely divides 
us into two camps- those for or against pupil assignment. _ISSUE 
NO& 2. 
TEACHER ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER TO DESEGREGATE._ In large cities 
like Baltimore, Louisville, and Washington, D&C&, should school 
desegregation be extended to all-Negro and all-white schools by 
assigning white and Negro teachers, respectively? On the one hand 
do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a <child> 
not be denied admission to a school on account of his race? Or should 
we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different 
races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other 
school, we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust 
to people of another race within the school namely, to a teacher of another 
race. We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation 
impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated 
situation. _ISSUE NO& 3. 
THE PLAINTIFF IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASES._ 
The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that 
resulted in desegregation. In each instance the plaintiff was a private 
citizen. In thousands of school districts, indeed, in the entire 
State of Mississippi, no plaintiff has come forth. And I have established 
that the action of municipal, county, or state school boards 
or boards of education is small, infinitesimally small in comparison 
with the number of districts. Is the requirement that the plaintiff be 
a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement? 
Should Congress authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish 
admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance? 
Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision 
for the Attorney General to act was eliminated, should we 
nevertheless 
support such a clause? This is an issue, for it divides 
people rather sharply. _ISSUE NO& 4. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS TO 
SCHOOLS 
THAT DENY CHILDREN ON ACCOUNT OF RACE._ This is the Powell Amendment, 
which in 1957 divided even a "liberal" group like the American 
Veterans Committee (~AVC). Should we support a clause in Federal 
school construction or school assistance legislation that would 
deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a 
child on account of his race? This is softer than earlier Powell amendments 
which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts. 
There is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause, 
softened though it be, on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary 
to the public schools. The Federal funds limitation enlists the support 
of many, the opposition of quite a few. _ISSUE NO& 5. 
REQUIRED 
PUBLIC EDUCATION._ Should a political subdivision, state or county 
or municipality, be required to furnish public education? For the 
school year, 1959-1960, the Prince Edward County (Virginia) Board 
of Supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education, and 
the school board therefore could provide no public education- for white 
or Negro children. Is public education in this American democracy 
of such importance that no child should be denied public education? 
Or is this subject a matter of self-determination, a matter of states 
rights or county rights? If people don't want to provide public 
education, should they be forced to do so? Even if we marshal substantial 
agreement behind mandatory public education, we likely cannot 
expect that all the states will enact the legislation. Should the 
requirement, which must therefore be Federal in nature, be legislated 
by the United States Congress? Or must it become law by amendment 
of the United States Constitution? We actually have two issues 
in this question- goal and method. _ISSUE NO& 6. FEDERAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR EDUCATION OF THE CITIZENS._ If the above issue is settled 
by requiring public education for all citizens, Issue No& 6 may 
be moot. If, on the other hand, it is not settled, or while it is being 
debated and resolved, does the Federal government have a responsibility 
in situations like that in Prince Edward County? Nearly 
half the children still receive no education. Must or should the Federal 
government help? Should the government directly provide education 
for the children who want public education?

The next question is whether board members favor their own social 
classes in their roles as educational policy-makers. On the whole, 
it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit 
way. Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly 
drawn. A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment 
of a free public junior college in a community where there already 
was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately 
but was too expensive for working-class youth. In situations 
of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education. 
Campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve 
western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found "little or no 
relationship between certain social and economic factors and school 
board competence", as judged by a panel of professional educators who 
studied the voting records on educational issues.   The few cases 
of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not 
to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who 
favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay 
increases for teachers, and such issues are not issues of educational 
policy.   In general, it appears that trustees and board members 
attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of 
educational policy, and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant 
values of the society are middle-class values, which are generally 
thought 
to be valid for the entire society. There have been very few cases 
of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any 
other class in the field of educational policy. If there were more such 
cases, it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers 
favor their own social classes.   There is currently a major 
controversy of public education in which group interests and values 
are heavily engaged. This is the issue of segregated schools in the 
South. In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial 
groups rather than social-class groups. Thus, the white middle and 
lower classes are arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes. 
This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class 
people better than it suits white lower-class people. If this happens, 
there may be some class conflict in the South, with school boards 
and school teachers taking the middle-class position. 

#THE EDUCATIONAL 
PROFESSION#

The members of the educational profession have 
a major voice in the determination of educational policy, their position 
being strongest in the universities. They are mostly upper-middle- 
and lower-middle-class people, with a few in the upper class. Do they 
make class-biased decisions?   In a society dominated by middle-class 
values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens 
these social values, it is clear that the educational profession 
must work for the values which are characteristic of the society. 
There is no problem here. The problem arises, if it does arise, when 
the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his 
professional competence, but which bears some relation to the social 
structure. For instance, in giving school grades or in making recommendations 
for the award of a college scholarship, does he consciously 
or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class? Again, 
in deciding on the content and method of his teaching, does he favor 
a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the 
race for higher economic status, or does he favor a curriculum which 
strengthens students in other ways?   The answers to questions 
such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's 
own social-class position and also upon his social history, as well as 
upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator. 
In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class 
backgrounds, Wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students 
and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as 
well as on his social-class background. One upward-mobile teacher may 
be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to 
develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb, while 
another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with 
lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations 
at home, and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment.

One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy 
today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are 
upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families. 
Their own experience in the social system influences their work and 
attitudes as teachers. While this influence is a complex matter, depending 
upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his 
social-class experience, there probably are some general statements about 
social-class background and educational policy that can be made with 
a fair degree of truth.   Teachers who have been upward mobile 
probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves 
students as it has served them; that is, they are likely to favor 
a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value. This does 
not necessarily 
mean that such teachers will favor vocational education, 
as contrasted with liberal education, but they are likely to favor 
an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement 
value, as against a kind of "pure" liberal education that 
is not designed to help people get better jobs.   There is no doubt 
that higher education since World War /2, has moved away from 
"pure" liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and 
specialization. There are several causes for this, one being rapid economic 
development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions 
requiring engineering or scientific training. But another cause may 
lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their 
own use of education as a means of social advancement.   Compared 
with the college and university faculty members of the period from 
1900 to 1930, the new postwar faculty members consist of more children 
of immigrants and more children 
of urban working-class fathers. Their experience is quite in contrast 
with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born 
parents, who are more likely to regard education as good for its own 
sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum. 

#THE 
"PUBLIC INTEREST" GROUPS#

Educational policies are formed by 
several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in 
the public interest. Legislators are one such group, and state legislators 
have major responsibility for educational legislation. They generally 
vote so as to serve their own constituency, and if the constituency 
should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class, they might 
be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests 
in education. However, there are relatively few such political constituencies, 
and, as has been pointed out, there is seldom a clear-cut distinction 
between the educational interests of one social class and those 
of another.   Another public interest group is the commission 
of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem 
and to make recommendations. Generally these commissions work 
earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society, as they conceive 
it. Nevertheless, their conclusions and recommendations cannot 
please everybody, and they often represent a particular economic or political 
point of view. For instance, there have been two Presidential 
Commissions on higher education since World War /2,. President 
Truman's Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal, 
expansionist position, while President Eisenhower's Committee 
on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative. 
Both Commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people, 
who attempted to act in the public interest.   An example of a 
more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the Commission on 
the Financing of Higher Education sponsored by the Association of 
American Universities and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation 
and the Carnegie Corporation. This Commission recommended against 
the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities 
and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships. 
This might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias, 
but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by 
Byron S& Hollingshead entitled <Who Should Go to College?> 
which recommended a federal government scholarship program. Furthermore, 
the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education 
as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support 
of private higher education. Thus, the Commission acted with a 
sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions 
about the problem of government support to private education.   Then 
there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations, 
who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by 
their support or refusal to support various educational programs, experiments, 
and demonstrations. These people are practically always upper- 
or upper-middle-class persons, who attempt to act in what they regard 
as the interest of the entire society.   Finally there are 
the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the 
National Association of Parents and Teachers, and the Citizens Committee 
on Public Schools. These have an upper-middle-class leadership 
and a middle-class membership, with rare exceptions, where working-class 
parents are active in local P&-T&A& matters. Like 
the 
other policy-making groups, these are middle class in their educational 
attitudes, and they attempt to act in the general public interest, 
as they see it.   In general it appears that educational decisions 
and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the 
interests of the society as a whole. They are predominantly middle- 
and upper-class people, and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes 
of those classes. They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class 
values and consequently fail to take them into account. But there 
is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one 
social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education. 
They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society 
and try to serve the entire society. 

#ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE SOCIAL 
STRUCTURE THROUGH EDUCATION#

Educational policy in the United States 
has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural 
opportunity. 
In so far as this goal is achieved, the society becomes more 
fluid, artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced, and people 
at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the 
material 
and cultural goods of society. On the other hand, there is a counterbalancing 
purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages 
of the parents to their children. This leads to efforts at exclusiveness 
through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification 
in the schools. Both of these purposes exist side by side without much 
overt conflict under present conditions. 

#MAXIMIZING ECONOMIC AND 
CULTURAL OPPORTUNITY#

The broad expansion of free education results 
both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society 
and in promoting fluidity within the social structure. Fifty years 
ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an 
example of this movement. During the past decade the program has been 
carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities, 
state colleges, and community colleges. The reaffirmation of 
American faith in the comprehensive high school, as expressed in the 
Conant study, is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of 
maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity.

The recent federal government's student-loan program is 
another step in the direction of making higher education more available 
to lower-status youth. It is probably more effective than the expanded 
scholarship programs of the past decade, because the scholarship programs 
mainly aided the students with the best academic records (who 
were usually middle-class), and these students tended to use the scholarship 
funds to go to more expensive colleges. Meanwhile, the private 
colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised 
an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds. The gains 
in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place 
largely in the publicly supported institutions.

Unfortunately, however, and for reasons to be discussed in the 
following chapter, no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory 
as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal 
costs in order to yield adequate revenues. And this fact may explain 
some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational 
formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units 
of service. One such disagreement, which will receive attention in 
this next chapter, concerns the question whether rates for different kinds 
of service, in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination, must 
be made directly <proportional> to marginal costs, or whether they 
should be based instead on <differences> in marginal costs. Here, 
the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma. 

#TWO MAJOR TYPES 
OF FULLY DISTRIBUTED COST ANALYSIS#

_1. THE DOUBLE-STEP TYPE_ 
Despite 
an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define "relative costs", 
the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as 
far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice. 
For more explicit expositions, one must distinguish different types 
of analyses. By all means the most important distinction is that 
between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution 
of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental 
or marginal costs, and those other apportionments which recognize no 
difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution.

The first, or double-step, type might also be called the "railroad 
type" because of its application to railroads (and other 
transportation agencies) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission. The Cost Section distinguishes between (directly) 
variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding 
chapter. The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units 
of freight traffic as representing "long-run out-of-pocket costs"- 
a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of 
the economist's "long-run marginal costs". There remains a residue 
of total costs, or total "revenue requirements" which, since 
it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations 
in traffic density, is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis. 
Nevertheless, because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make 
some kind of a distribution of total costs, it has apportioned this residue, 
which it sometimes calls "burden", among the units of carload 
traffic on a basis (partly ton, partly ton-mile) which is concededly 
quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination. In recent 
years, this burden (which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies 
in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic!) 
has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements 
which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to 
meet.   Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad 
rates, it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff 
of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket 
costs and apportioned residue costs. Suffice it to say that the usefulness 
of the latter apportionment is questionable. But in any event, 
full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and 
overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost 
analyses: namely, that between a cost allocation designed to 
reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates 
of output of different classes of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment 
which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service 
even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint 
of specific cost determination. _2. THE SINGLE-STEP TYPE_ We turn 
now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which, unlike the "railroad 
type", draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost 
apportionment: the single-step type. It might be called the "public 
utility" type because of the considerable use to which it has 
been put in gas and electric utility rate cases. Here no attempt is 
made, first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose 
on these costs "reasonably distributed" residues of total 
costs. Instead, all of the total costs are treated as variable costs, 
although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be 
functions of different variables. Moreover, whereas in Interstate Commerce 
Commission parlance "variable cost" means a cost deemed to 
vary in <direct> proportion to changes in rate of output, in the type 
of analysis now under review "variable cost" has been used more 
broadly, so as to cover costs which, while a function of some one variable 
(such as output of energy, or number of customers), are not necessarily 
a <linear> function.   As already noted in an earlier 
paragraph, the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or 
utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes 
of service, such as residential, commercial, industrial power, street 
lighting, etc&. This "grand division" permits many costs to be 
assigned in their entirety to some one class, such as street lighting, 
or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes. 
High-tension industrial power service, for example, would not 
be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of 
the low-tension distribution lines. But the major portions of the total 
costs of a utility business are common or joint to all, or nearly 
all, classes of customers; and these costs must somehow be apportioned 
among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among 
the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve 
as tentative measures of reasonable rates.   The general basis on 
which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units 
of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem 
of an electric-utility cost analysis. But before turning to this 
example, we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis, both of which belong 
to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type.

In the first subtype, the analyst (following the practice of railroad 
analysis in this particular respect) distributes both total operating 
costs and total annual capital costs (including an allowance for 
"cost of capital" or "fair rate of return") among the different 
classes and units of service. Here, an apportionment, say, of $5,000,000 
of the total costs to residential service as a class would include 
an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital 
is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers.

But in the second subtype, which I take to be the one 
more frequently applied, only the operating expenses and not the "cost 
of capital" or "fair return" are apportioned directly among the 
various classes of service. To be sure, the capital investments in 
(or, alternatively, the estimated "fair values" of) the plant and 
equipment are apportioned among the different classes, as are also the 
gross revenues received from the sales of the different services. But 
any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service 
over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a "return" 
realized on the capital investment attributed to the same 
service. Thus, during any given year (a) if the revenues from the residential 
service are $7,000,000, (b) if the operating expenses imputed 
to this class of service come to $5,000,000, and (c) if the net investment 
in (or value of) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this 
service amounts to $30,000,000, the cost analyst will report that residential 
service, in the aggregate, has yielded a return of $2,000,000 
or 6-2/3 per cent. Other services will show different rates of return, 
some probably much lower and some higher.   There are obvious 
reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding "cost of capital" 
from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different 
classes of service- notably, the avoidance of the controversial question 
what rate of return should be held to constitute "cost of capital" 
or "fair rate of return". But the practice is likely to be 
misleading, since it may seem to support a conclusion that, as long 
as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating 
expenses plus <some> return on capital investment, however low, the 
rates of charge for this service are compensatory. Needless to say, any 
such inference would be quite unwarranted.   For the reason just 
suggested, I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed 
cost apportionment in the following simplified example. That 
is to say, an allowance for "cost of capital" will be assumed to 
be included directly in the cost apportionment. 

#THREE-PART ANALYSIS 
OF THE COSTS OF AN ELECTRIC UTILITY BUSINESS#

In order to simplify 
the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis, let us 
assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company 
supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation 
plant. Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type 
of service, all of which is supplied at the same voltage, phase, etc& 
to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. This latter 
assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial 
aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the distinction among 
costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along 
different dimensions.   Since the company under review is supplying 
what we are here regarding as only one kind of service, we might 
suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very 
simple; indeed, that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual 
operating and capital costs of the business, followed by a calculation 
of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption. 
In fact, however, the problem is not so simple. For a statement 
of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these 
costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output (or consumption) of 
energy. A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required.

The simplest division, and the one most frequently used (with 
subdivisions) in gas and electric rate cases, is a threefold division 
of the total operating and capital costs into "customer costs", 
"energy" or "volumetric costs", and "demand" or "capacity" 
costs. If this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart 
in the actual rates of charge for service, as it actually does 
have in some rates, there would result a three-part rate for any one 
class of service. For example, the monthly bill of a residential 
consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge, a $5 charge for 250 
kilowatt-hours of energy at 2@ per kilowatt-hour, and a $2 charge for 
a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 
per kilowatt- a total bill of $8 for that month. But our present interest 
lies in the measurement of costs of service, and only indirectly 
in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs. Let 
us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn, recognizing 
that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative 
purposes; costs actually vary in much more complex ways. _1. THE 
CUSTOMER COSTS_ These are those operating and capital costs found to 
vary with number of customers regardless, or almost regardless, of power 
consumption. Included as a minimum are the costs of metering and 
billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in 
taking on another consumer. These minimum costs may come to $1 per month, 
more or less, for residential and small commercial customers, although 
they are substantially higher for large industrial users, who require 
more costly connections and metering devices. While costs on this 
order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial 
rates, in the form of a mere "service charge", they are more 
frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles 
the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further 
payment.   But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost 
imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice 
of including, not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked 
as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial 
fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary 
(low-voltage) distribution system- a fraction equal to the estimated 
annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity.

The preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined 
by the sociologist. Like primitive numbers in mathematics, the entire 
axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth. 
But what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces 
the idea of physical models? Is it not the task of philosophy 
to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacred 
canons in social science? It has become painfully clear that the 
very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by 
erecting mathematical and physical models, is itself a conditioned response 
to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation.

This push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the 
measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led 
sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word "mass" to 
mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals 
in such a group can be studied. (Cf& Rapoport, 1959: 
ch& 11.) Here I think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent. 
The simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs 
to be questioned. For if the small group notion involves the implicit 
claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic 
or subatomic proportions, the philosopher needs to know the extent to 
which such entities are valid. The mere exploration of the unconscious 
ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical 
and logical investigation. (Cf& Brodbeck, 1959: Ch& 12.)

A parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation 
between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically 
formed. Philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection 
of socially viable categories. This involves a sifting of the 
empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement. 
Merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in 
the study of different cultures, yet it is perfectly clear as Nagel 
(1957:247-83) and Hempel (1959:271-307) indicate, that the concept 
of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological 
models, in which the notions of teleology, i&e&, metaphysical 
purpose, are central. (Cf& Chapter /9,.) Functionalism as 
a sociological credo is, therefore, not a direct consequence of observations, 
but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference 
and judgment.   The purpose of this sort of philosophical study 
of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social 
science. It is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise 
to sociology, since the former is a logical, rational discipline, 
where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical. Such a position 
entails the negation of philosophy in its Platonic form as something 
soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences. 
But contrary to Whitehead, philosophy is not a synonym for Plato. 
The uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to 
any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism. However, 
when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences, to dictate the 
conditions of empirical research, 
it becomes formal metaphysics; shaping 
the contours of life to fit the needs of legends. The notion of philosophy 
as Queen Bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political 
ideology, but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial 
notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social 
sciences. (Cf& Wetter, 1952: Pt& /2, Ch& 5; Horowitz 
1957b&.)   Metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with 
nature as it was in antiquity. It has surrendered any claims of description 
in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness, as in Heidegger's 
system (1929). Science is mocked for wishing to know nothing 
of Nothing, in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense 
of men. It is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality 
by distinguishing between description and prescription. It is 
simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during 
this century.   Consider the traditional "four fields" 
of philosophy: logic, ethics, epistemology and esthetics. It is a 
commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic 
hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological 
criteria, they move away from philosophy as such. What is left 
to traditional systems of philosophy is, in effect, only the history 
of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by 
the canons of scientific method. In this situation, philosophy has survived 
by separating itself from metaphysics, by showing the ultimate 
questions to be the meaningless questions.   The relinquishing 
by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an 
ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was 
unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of 
more humble sorts. In the new situation, philosophy is able to provide 
the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers 
the physical sciences, a reservoir of logical relations that can be used 
in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value. Beyond 
this, philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the 
type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry, 
but within its potential domain of relevance. In this connection, 
it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery 
long before its uses in political science were exploited. Likewise, 
Kant formulated the nebular hypothesis, according to which the solar 
system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas, nearly 
a half century before its scientific value was made plain by Laplace 
in his <Systeme du Monde>. This does not mean that philosophy resolves 
the problems it generates, any more so than Riemann's geometry 
settled the physical status of the space-time continuum. But the forceful 
presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself 
a monumental task.   To those raised on Marcel's <Homo Viator> 
and Heidegger's <das Nichtige>, this may seem a modest 
role for philosophy. However, modesty and triviality are different qualities. 
Philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear 
as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve. 
The ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind 
has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a 
more durable sort of drama. By clarifying fundamental premises in the 
social sciences, and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands 
of each new scientific discipline, philosophy can offer the 
sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding. 
Philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful 
and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis 
or theory is framed. The dissection of scientific theory, the examination 
of a theory from the vantage-points of language, epistemology, 
and ethics, is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge, no less 
so because of its removal from empirical research.   The realm 
of science, whatever the degree of precision in formulations, covers 
the range of prediction and explanation. (Cf& Hempel and Oppenheim, 
1948:135-75.) Whatever philosophy is conceived to be, its rationalist, 
logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is 
something other than science. For some forms of philosophy, this very 
division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the 
metaphysical superiority of the latter. Bergson and Leroy announce 
that "the secret is the center of a philosophy" and thereafter a 
hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity. This is simply a 
confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous. For 
as Merleau-Ponty indicated (1953), it is not the secret which is important, 
but the removal of secrecy. In this, philosophy and science 
share a common goal. The hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees 
that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall 
not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for this 
division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between 
mysticism and science.   The mystification of metaphysical systems 
does not imply the demise of philosophy, only the close of a philosophic 
age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical. The 
tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private 
intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific 
and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict 
over the limits and purpose of science, religion and ideology. (Cf& 
McGlynn: 1958.) Scientific systems, and this includes even 
the relation of mechanist to relativist physics, are built upon, refined 
and corrected. Philosophic systems, by the very nature of their completeness, 
are overthrown by rival systems. In addition to the incompleteness 
of science and the completeness of metaphysics, they differ 
in that science is essentially descriptive, while philosophy in its inherited 
forms, tends to be goal-oriented, teleological and prescriptive. 
The threadbare notion that belief, unlike behaviour, is not subject 
to objective analysis, has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against 
the sociology of knowledge, since it is precisely the job of the 
sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable 
than social behaviour.   When dealing with the actual relation 
of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge, or better the role of philosophy 
in assisting research on the social sources of ideas, one has 
to become necessarily selective. Certain features we have touched upon: 
philosophy as a logical, deductive system from which a social science 
methodology can be built up; philosophic analysis of the assumptions 
and presumptions of the social sciences; and philosophy as a 
guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological 
investigations.

The objection will be raised that the most important 
role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted, 
namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in 
the social sciences. Specifically, it will be asked whether the "real" 
questions people ask are not the "ultimate" questions that 
social science finds itself impotent in the face of. What then is the 
status of such questions as: is society the ground of human existence 
or a means to an individual goal? Do societies develop according 
to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals? 
Does society really exist as an entity over and above the 
agglomeration of men? I think it must be said that, contrary to metaphysical 
insistence, these are questions so framed as to defy either 
empirical exploration or rational solutions. As Simmel (1908) and Dilthey 
(1922) indicated, questions of whether the value of life is individual 
or social are not questions, but assertions of faith made to 
appear as legitimate questions. Such pseudo-questions assume that answers 
of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving 
undefined universals. Social theory has no more right to expect results 
from meaningless questions, than physics has the right to expect a 
theological solution to the wave-particle controversy.   It is not 
that such questions are not asked. It is rather that introducing them 
into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for 
certainty. An operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract 
certainty, since it is certainty which every new discovery in science 
either replaces or reshapes. To raise the added objection that 
men require certainty on psychological grounds, answers to ultimate questions 
having an irrational rather than scientific basis, is in a real 
sense to undermine the objection itself. For what concerns all scientific 
disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational, 
i&e&, for the scientific determination of what in past ages 
was considered ultimate and irrational.   A philosophy which attempts 
to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence 
in the shortcomings of men, an impatience with partial, tentative 
solutions. Men have always lived in a tentative world, and in suspension 
of ultimate judgments where and when necessary. Uncertainty 
overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise 
information about the world. Without such uncertainty we are left 
with a set of dogmas and myths. The functional interplay of philosophy 
and science should, as a minimum, guarantee a meaningful option to 
myth-making.   A degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition 
for the growth of science. 
But neither was the statement empirical, for goodness was not a quality 
like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard. What were they to 
do, then, with these awkward judgments of value? To find a place for 
them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the 
theory radically, and yet that theory was what they regarded as their 
most important discovery. It appeared that the theory could be saved 
in one way only. If it could be shown that judgments of good and bad 
were not judgments at all, that they asserted nothing true or false, but 
merely expressed emotions like "Hurrah" or "Fiddlesticks", 
then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads 
could be at rest. This is the course the positivists took. They 
explained value judgments by explaining them away.   Now I do not 
think their view will do. But before discussing it, I should like 
to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they 
have stated their case. It has been said of John Stuart Mill that 
he wrote so clearly that he could be found out. This theory has been 
put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind, 
and this I will do my best to supply. The theory claims to show 
by analysis that when we say, "That is good", we do not mean to assert 
a character of the subject of which we are thinking. I shall argue 
that we do mean to do just that.   Let us work through an example, 
and the simpler and commoner the better. There is perhaps no value 
statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement 
that intense pain is bad. Let us take a set of circumstances 
in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which 
I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement. We 
come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in 
common use. There are signs that it has struggled for days to escape 
and that in a frenzy of hunger, pain, and fear, it has all but eaten 
off its own leg. The attempt failed: the animal is now dead. As we 
think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered, we are 
very 
likely to say: "It was a bad thing that the little animal should 
suffer so". The positivist tells us that when we say this we are 
only expressing our present emotion. I hold, on the contrary, that we 
mean to assert something of the pain itself, namely, that it was bad- 
bad when and as it occurred.   Consider what follows from the 
positivist view. On that view, nothing good or bad happened in the case 
until I came on the scene and made my remark. For what I express 
in my remark is something going on in me at the time, and that of course 
did not exist until I did come on the scene. The pain of the rabbit 
was not itself bad; nothing evil was happening when that pain was 
being endured; badness, in the only sense in which it is involved 
at all, waited for its appearance till I came and looked and felt. Now 
that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows. Let 
us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene 
and that the rabbit never was discovered. Are we prepared to say that 
in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did? 
Clearly not. Indeed we should say, on the contrary, that the accident 
of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness 
of the animal's pain, that it would have been every whit as bad 
whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel 
repugnance or not. If so, then it is clear that in saying the suffering 
was bad we are not expressing our feelings only. We are saying that 
the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an 
attitude toward it.   The first argument is thus an ideal experiment 
in which we use the method of difference. It removes our present 
expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected 
by this, whereas on positivist grounds it should be. The second argument 
applies the method in the reverse way. It ideally removes the past 
event, and shows that this would render false what we mean to say, 
whereas on positivist grounds it should not. Let us suppose that the 
animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all, but 
that we mistakenly believe it did, and say as before that its suffering 
was an evil thing. On the positivist theory, everything I sought 
to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in 
the second. In the only sense in which badness is involved at all, whatever 
was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety, since 
all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling, and that 
feeling is still there. And our question is, is such an implication 
consistent with what we meant? Clearly it is not. If anyone asked 
us, after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing, whether 
we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident 
had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all, we should 
say that it made all the difference in the world, that what we were 
asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred 
back there, that if this had not occurred, there was nothing left to 
be bad, and that our assertion was in that case mistaken. The suggestion 
that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making 
no mistake, because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about 
the past suffering, seems to me merely frivolous. If we did not mean 
to say this, why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering 
had not occurred? On the theory before us, such relief would be 
groundless, for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all, 
and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved 
about. The positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition.

So far as I can see, there is only one way out for 
the positivist. He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of 
approval or disapproval. And there is a way in which he might hold 
that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval 
without belonging to the pain itself. The pain in itself was neutral; 
but unfortunately the rabbit, on no grounds at all, took up toward 
this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the 
first time, and in the only intelligible sense, bad. This way of escape 
is theoretically possible, but since it has grave difficulties of 
its own and has not, so far as I know, been urged by positivists, it 
is perhaps best not to spend time over it.   I come now to a third 
argument, which again is very simple. When we come upon the rabbit 
and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing, we presumably 
make it with some feeling; the positivists are plainly right in 
saying that such remarks do usually express feeling. But suppose that 
a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement 
again. And suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that 
the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded. 
The pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now 
so 
fatigued in body and mind that feeling is, as we say, quite dead. In 
these circumstances, since what was expressed by the remark when first 
made is, on the theory before us, simply absent, the remark now expresses 
nothing. It is as empty as the word "Hurrah" would be when 
there was no enthusiasm behind it. And this seems to me untrue. When 
we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing, the feeling 
with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point, 
but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before, we 
should certainly answer Yes. We should say that we made our point 
with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time, 
but that it was the same point we were making. And if we can see that 
what we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling varies from 
intensity to near zero, it is not the feeling that we primarily meant 
to express.   I come now to a fourth consideration. We all believe 
that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting 
and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would 
not make sense. Broad and Ross have lately contended that this fitness 
is one of the main facts of ethics, and I suspect they are right. 
But that is not exactly my point. My point is this: whether there 
is such fitness or not, we all assume that there is, and if we do, we 
express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do. Let 
me illustrate.   In his novel <The House of the Dead>, Dostoevsky 
tells of his experiences in a Siberian prison camp. Whatever 
the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today, Dostoevsky's companions 
were about as grim a lot as can be imagined. "I have heard 
stories", he writes, "of the most terrible, the most unnatural actions, 
of the most monstrous murders, told with the most spontaneous, 
childishly merry laughter". Most of us would say that in this delight 
at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something 
very unfitting. If we were asked why we thought so, we should say 
that these things involve great evil and are wrong, and that to take 
delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting. Now on the subjectivist 
view, this answer is ruled out. For before someone takes 
up an attitude toward death, suffering, or their infliction, they have 
no moral quality at all. There is therefore nothing about them to which 
an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting. They are 
in themselves neutral, and, so far as they get a moral quality, they 
get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker. 
But if that is true, why is any attitude more fitting than any 
other? Would applause, for example, be fitting if, apart from the 
applause, there were nothing good to applaud? Would condemnation be 
fitting if, independently of the condemnation, there were nothing bad 
to condemn? In such a case, any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting 
as any other, which means that the notion of fitness has lost 
all point.   Indeed we are forced to go much farther. If goodness 
and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being 
by them, those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry 
laughter are taking the only sensible line. If there is nothing evil 
in these things, if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling 
about them, why shouldn't they be greeted with a cheer? To greet 
them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something 
bad; it would needlessly bring badness into the world; and even 
on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright. On the 
other hand, to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral 
into something good; it would bring goodness into the world.

The injured German veteran was a former miner, twenty-four years 
old, who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head. This 
resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left 
side of the cerebellum also. In any event, the extraordinary result 
of this injury was that he became "psychically blind", while at 
the same time, apparently, the sense of touch remained essentially intact. 
Psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence 
of visual memory-images, a condition in which, for example, one 
is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture 
of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence. 
This circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual 
capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its 
exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented 
by the authors is overwhelming that, when the patient closed his eyes, 
he had absolutely no spatial (that is, third-dimensional) awareness 
whatsoever. The necessary inference, as the authors themselves interpret 
it, would seem to be this: "(1) Spatial qualities are not among 
those grasped by the sense of touch, <as such>. We do not arrive 
at spatial images by means of the sense of touch <by itself>. (2) 
Spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual 
representations; that is, there is, in the true sense, only a <visual> 
space". The underlying assumption, of course, is that only 
sight and touch enable us, in any precise and fully dependable way, to 
locate objects in space beyond us, the other senses being decidedly inferior, 
if not totally inadequate, in this regard. This is an assumption 
with which few would be disposed to quarrel. Therefore, if the sense 
of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence 
of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed 
and an object is handled, the conclusion seems unavoidable that 
touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality 
of things and that actual sight or visual representations are 
necessary.   The force of the authors' analysis (if indeed it 
has any force) can be felt by the reader, I believe, only after three 
questions have been successfully answered. (1) What allows us to think 
that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his 
eyes were closed? (2) What evidence is there that he was psychically 
blind? (3) How can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly 
disturbed by his head injury? We shall consider these in the 
inverse order of their presentation.   Obviously, a satisfactory 
answer to the third question is imperative, if the argument is to 
get under way at all, for if there is any possibility of doubt whether 
the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital 
lesion, any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become 
completely ambiguous and fail altogether, of course, as evidence to 
establish the desired conclusion. The answer the authors give to it, 
therefore, is of supreme importance. It is as follows: "The usual 
sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness 
(pressure, pain, temperature), as well as the kinesthetic 
sensations 
(muscular feelings, feelings in the tendons and joints), were, 
as such, essentially intact, although they seemed, in comparison with 
normal reactions, to be somewhat diminished over the entire body. The 
supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient 
and his ability to specify the location of a member, as well as 
the direction and scope of a movement, passively executed (with one of 
his members), proved to have been, on the contrary, very considerably 
affected". The authors insist, however, that these abnormalities in 
the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that 
sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained 
to the sense of sight.   First of all, what is their evidence 
that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged? (1) When 
an object was placed in the patient's hand, he had no difficulty determining 
whether it was warm or cold, sharp or blunt, rough or smooth, 
flexible, soft, or hard; and he could tell, simply by the feel of 
it, whether it was made of wood, iron, cloth, rubber, and so on. And 
he could recognize, by touch alone, articles which he had handled immediately 
before, even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and 
could not be identified by him; that is, he was unaware what kind 
of objects they were or what their use was. (2) The patient attained 
an astonishing efficiency in a new trade. Because of his brain injury 
and the extreme damage suffered to his sight, the patient had to train 
himself for a new line of work, that of a portfolio-maker, an occupation 
requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements 
and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour. It seems clear, 
when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight 
of the patient (we shall describe it in detail in connection with our 
second question, the one concerning the psychical blindness of the 
patient), that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the 
usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably 
more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal 
vision. And so the authors conclude: "The conduct of the patient 
in his every-day life and in his work, even more than the foregoing 
facts [mentioned above under 1], leave positively no room for doubt 
that the sense of touch, in the ordinary sense of the word, was unaffected; 
or, to put the same thing in physiological terms, that the performance-capacity 
of the tactual apparatus, from the periphery up to 
the tactual centers in the brain,- that is, from one end to the other- 
was unimpaired".   If the argument is accepted as essentially 
sound up to this point, it remains for us to consider whether the 
patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating 
objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective 
visual condition. But before we can do this, we must first find 
answers to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps 
be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question 
at hand.   In what ways, then, did the patient's psychical 
blindness manifest itself? He could not see objects as unified, 
self-contained, and organized figures, as a person does with normal 
vision. The meaning of this, as we shall see, is that he had no fund 
of visual memory-images of objects as objects; and, therefore, he could 
not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again. Instead, 
he constantly became lost in parts and components of them, confused 
some of their details with those of neighboring objects, and so 
on, unless he allowed time to "trace" the object in question through 
minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover 
its contours. According to his own testimony, he never actually saw things 
as shaped but only as generally amorphous "blots" of color of 
a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty 
much out of focus altogether. But by the tracing procedure, he could, 
in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner, find the unseen form; could 
piece, as it were, the jumbled mass together into an organized whole 
and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned 
out to be. If, however, the figure to be discerned were complicated, 
composed of several interlocking subfigures, and so on, even the tracing 
process failed him, and he could not focus even relatively simple 
shapes among its parts. This meant, concretely, that the patient could 
not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or 
body, became easily confused by "hasher marks" inserted between hand-written 
words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters, and 
could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing 
it.   The patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery 
at all; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corroborate 
him. After a conversation with another man, he was able to 
recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe 
at all what the other man looked like. Nor could he call up memory-pictures 
of close friends or relatives. In short, both his own declarations 
and his figural blindness, when he looked at objects, seem to 
present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all. 
He was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed, precisely 
because he could not assign it to a visual shape, already learned 
and held in visual memory, as persons of normal vision do. He could 
not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he 
had no visual memory at all. Therefore, his only recourse was to learn 
the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same 
individual object or type of object; and this he could do only by 
going over its mass with the tracing procedure. Then he might finally 
recognize it, apparently by combining the visual blot, actually being 
seen, with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing 
movements. This would mean, it can readily be seen, that, again, 
for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated 
because of the absence of visual imagery.   As one would 
surmise, the procedure, however, could be repeated with the same object 
or with the same type of object often enough, so that the corresponding 
visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would 
provide clues as to the actual shape, which the patient then immediately 
could determine by a kind of inference. Men, trees, automobiles, 
houses, and so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life- 
had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable, 
at the very beginning of tracing, by an inference as to what 
each was. Dice, for example, he inferred from black dots on a white surface. 
He evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects, 
but their size and the dots gave them away. And the authors give 
numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to 
show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself 
and how proficient he became at it. Often he seems even to have been 
able to guess correctly, without the tracing motions, solely on the basis 
of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared 
in his visual experience.   Perhaps the very important question- 
What is, then, exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the 
patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing 
movements when he is actually looking at things?- has now been 
raised in the reader's mind and in the following form. If the patient 
can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually, 
then, it would seem, the sense of touch has immediate contact 
with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representations, 
at least in regard to two dimensions, and, as we shall see, even 
this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied 
by the authors. How, then, do the kinesthetic sensations function in 
all this? The authors set about answering this fundamental question 
through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability, tactually, 
(1) to perceive figure and (2) to locate objects in space, with his 
eyes closed (or turned away from the object concerned). Quite naturally, 
they make the investigation, first, by prohibiting the patient from 
making any movements at all and then, later, by repeating it and allowing 
the patient to move in any way he wanted to.   When the 
patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all, the following 
striking results occurred. 
Whenever artists, indeed, turned to actual representations or molded 
three-dimensional figures, which were rare down to 800 B&C&, they 
tended to reflect reality (see Plate 6~a, 9~b); a schematic, 
abstract treatment of men and animals, <by intent,> rose only in the 
late eighth century.   To speak of this underlying view of the 
world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment. At the least, 
however, one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order; 
their principles of composition stand very close to those which 
appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line. Their world, again, 
was a still simple, traditional age which was only slowly beginning 
to appreciate the complexity of life. And perhaps an observer of the 
vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers 
and users was basically stable and secure. The storms of the past 
had died away, and the great upheaval which was to mark the following 
century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds.   Throughout 
the work of the later ninth century a calm, severe serenity displays 
itself. In the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel 
one in its internal self-satisfaction, but the best of the Geometric 
pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made 
in the Greek world. The ninth century was in its artistic work "the 
spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future", 
and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a 
testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and 
was appreciated. _THE AEGEAN IN 800 B&C&_ GEOMETRIC POTTERY 
has not yet received the thorough, detailed study which it 
deserves, 
partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some 
of its local manifestations, as at Argos, are only now coming to light. 
From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects, however, the 
historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress 
of the Aegean world down to 800 B&C&   The general intellectual 
outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated 
to a significant degree. Much which was in embryo in 1000 
had become reasonably well developed by 800. In this process the Minoan-Mycenaean 
inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected; 
the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that 
which 
rises more clearly in our vision after 800. Those modern scholars 
who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean 
development from earliest times- granted occasional irruptions of 
peoples and ideas from outside- are correct; but all too many observers 
have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change 
which took place in the early first millennium.   The focus 
of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of 
the 
Greek mainland, and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean, always excepting 
its northern shores, had accepted the Geometric style of pottery. 
While Protogeometric vases usually turn up, especially outside Greece 
proper, together with as many or more examples of local stamp, these 
"non-Greek" 
patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century. 
In their place came local variations <within> the common style- 
tentative, as it were, in Protogeometric products but truly distinct 
and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit developed. Attica, 
though important, was not the only teacher of this age. One can take 
a vase of about 800 B&C& and, without any knowledge of its place 
of origin, venture to assign it to a specific area; imitation and borrowing 
of motifs now become ascertainable. The potters of the Aegean 
islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland, and in Greece 
itself Argive, Corinthian, Attic, Boeotian, and other Geometric 
sequences have each their own hallmarks. These local variations were 
to become ever sharper in the next century and a half.   The same 
conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the Dark 
ages, from linguistic distribution, and from the survivals of early 
social, political, and religious patterns into later ages. By 800 B&C& 
the Aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture. 
On these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which 
was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the <Iliad>. 
Everywhere within the common pattern, however, one finds local 
diversity; Greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized, 
and plagued, by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors.

Further we cannot go, for the Dark ages deserve their 
name. Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized 
to find expression, nor could the simple economic and social foundations 
of this world support a lofty structure. The epic poems, the 
consolidation of the Greek pantheon, the rise of firm political units, 
the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations 
of men- all these had to await the progress of following decades. 
What we have seen in this chapter, we have seen only dimly, and 
yet the results, however general, are worth the search. These are 
the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly 
into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the 
Hellenic outlook, independent of outside forces.   To interpret, 
indeed, the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation 
may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed 
information; if we could see more deeply, we probably would find 
many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the 
period. The historian can only point out those lines which were major 
enough to find reflection in our limited evidence, and must hope that 
future excavations will enrich our understanding. Throughout the Dark 
ages, it is clear, the Greek world had been developing slowly but 
consistently. The pace could now be accelerated, for the inhabitants 
of the Aegean stood on firm ground. 

#CHAPTER 5 THE EARLY EIGHTH CENTURY# 

THE LANDSCAPE of Greek history broadens widely, and 
rather abruptly, in the eighth century B&C&, the age of Homer's 
"rosy-fingered Dawn". The first slanting rays of the new day 
cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the Aegean world; 
but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more 
unmistakably some of the lines of change. For this period, as for earlier 
centuries, pottery remains the most secure source; the ceramic 
material of the age is more abundant, more diversified, and more indicative 
of the hopes and fears of its makers, who begin to show scenes of 
human life and death. Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence 
of sculpture and architecture in Greece; objects in gold, 
ivory, 
and bronze grow more numerous. Since writing was practiced in the 
Aegean before the end of the century, we may hope that the details of 
tradition will now be occasionally useful. Though it is not easy to 
apply the evidence of the <Iliad> to any specific era, this marvelous 
product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape 
by 750.   The Dipylon Geometric pottery of Athens and the <Iliad> 
are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of Greek 
civilization; but both were among the last products of a phase 
which was ending. Greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution, 
in which the developed qualities of the Hellenic outlook were 
suddenly to break forth. The revolution was well under way before 
700 B&C&, and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century. 
The era, however, is Janus-faced. While many tokens point forward, 
the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns 
of the Dark ages. The dominant pottery of the century was Geometric; 
political organization revolved about the <basileis>; 
trade 
was just beginning to expand; the gods who protected the Greek countryside 
were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress.

The modern student, who knows what was to come next, is likely 
to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth 
century. Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis. 
Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted 
with radically new ideas; the poet of the <Iliad> deliberately 
archaized. Although it is not possible to sunder old and new 
in this era, I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the 
first 
decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee 
of the first stage of Greek civilization.   On this principle 
of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture, architecture, 
society, and politics; for the developments in these areas make sense 
only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself. The growing 
contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should 
be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture 
after 750. We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections 
to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery, the epic 
and the myth, and the religious evolution of early Greece; the important 
point, however, is that these magnificent achievements, unlike those 
of later decades, were only incidentally influenced by Oriental 
models. The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the <Iliad> lie in 
the Aegean past. _DIPYLON POTTERY_ THE POTTERY of the first 
half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe Geometric. The 
severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years, the Strong 
Geometric style of the late ninth century, display as firm a mastery 
of the principles underlying Geometric pottery; but artists now were 
ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance. The vases which resulted 
had different shapes, far more complex decoration, and a larger 
sense of style.   Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of 
this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader 
lines. In earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding 
a fundamental sense of order after chaos. They had had to work on very 
simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses. The 
potters, in particular, had virtually eschewed freehand drawing, elaborate 
motifs, and the curving lines of nature, while yet expressing a 
belief that there was order in the universe. In their vases were embodied 
the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of Greek civilization, 
at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work, and then more confidently 
in the initial stages of the Geometric style. By 800 social 
and cultural security had been achieved, at least on a simple plane; 
it was time to take bigger steps, to venture on experiments.   Ripe 
Geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments 
and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of 
motifs which they had inherited. In these respects the vases of the early 
eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress. 
To the ancestral lore, however, new materials were added. Painters 
left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color; instead they 
divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns 
into which freehand drawing began to creep. Wavy lines, feather-like 
patterns, rosettes of indefinitely floral nature, birds either singly 
or in stylized rows, animals in solemn frieze bands (see Plates 11-12)- 
all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary 
signs that the potters were broadening their gaze. The rows of animals 
and birds, in particular, suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes, 
transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles, but the 
specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are 
nonetheless Greek. Though the spread of this type of decoration in the 
Aegean has not yet been precisely determined, it seems to appear first 
in the Cyclades, which were among the leading exporters of pottery 
throughout the century.   As the material at the command of the 
potters grew and the volume of their production increased, the local 
variations within a common style became more evident. Plate 12 illustrates 
four examples, which are Ripe or Late Geometric work of common 
spirit but of different schools. 
Cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and, 
when he could not show the hide, arrested him. Thinking the evidence 
insufficient to get a conviction, he later released him. Even while suffering 
the trip to his home, Cook swore to Moore and Lane that he 
would kill the Indian.   Three weeks later following his recovery, 
armed with a writ issued by the Catskill justice on affidavits prepared 
by the district attorney, Cook and Russell rode to arrest Martinez. 
Arriving at daybreak, they found Julio in his corral and demanded 
that he surrender. Instead, he whirled and ran to his house for 
a gun forcing them to kill him, Cook reported.   Both Cook's 
and Russell's lives were threatened by the Mexicans following the 
killing, but the company officers felt that in the end, it would serve 
to quiet them despite their immediate emotion. General manager Pels 
even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans in suspense 
rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away, and try 
to have a few punished.   On February 17, Russell and Cook 
were sent to the Pena Flor community on the Vermejo to see about renting 
out ranches the company had purchased. While talking with Julian 
M& Beall, Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared, both 
heavily armed, and after watching the house for a while, rode away. 
It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and 
began riding down the stream. They had traveled only a short distance 
when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across 
the stream just ahead of them. Suspecting an ambush, the two deputies 
decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill.

After spending two nights (Wednesday and Thursday) in Catskill, 
the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business. 
They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock 
Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch. Half a mile below 
at the mouth of Salyer's Canyon was an old ranch that the company 
had purchased from A& J& Armstrong, occupied by a Mexican, 
his wife, and an old trapper. There were three houses in Salyer's 
Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff, the road winding along the top, 
entering above, and then passing down in front of the houses, thence 
to the Vermejo. To the west of this road was another low bluff, forty 
or fifty feet high, covered with scrub oak and other brush. As they 
were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the 
two bluffs, a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers. 
Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush, but one 
hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm, passing on through 
his body.   With the first reports, Russell's horse wheeled 
to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook, followed by a 
hail of bullets, raced towards the arroyo of Salyer's Canyon immediately 
in front of him, just reaching it as his horse fell. Grabbing 
his Winchester from its sheath, Cook prepared to fight from behind 
the arroyo bank. Bullets were so thick, throwing sand in his face, that 
he found it difficult to return the fire. Noticing Russell's horse 
in front of the long log building, he assumed his friend had slipped 
inside and would be able to put up a good fight, so he began working 
his way down the ditch to join him. At a very shallow place, two Mexicans 
rushed into the open for a shot. Dropping to one knee, Cook 
felled one, and the other struggled off with his comrade, sending no further 
fire in his direction. Just before leaving the arroyo where he 
was partially concealed, he did hear shots down at the house. 
Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised, dismounted, but just 
as the old trapper opened the door to receive him, he fell into the trapper's 
arms- dead. A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding 
in a little chicken house had passed through his head, tearing a hole 
two-inches square on the outgoing side. Finding him dead, Cook caught 
Russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report 
the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins.

Before daylight Sunday morning, a posse of twenty-three men under 
the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed 
the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves, where 100 to 150 
Mexicans had gathered. MacPherson boldly approached the fortified 
adobe house and demanded entrance. The men inside informed him that they 
had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see 
them even though he offered medical aid. The officer demanded the names 
of the injured men; the Mexicans not only refused to give them, 
but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it. Since 
the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated, too small a posse 
had been collected, and since the deputy had not been provided with 
search warrants, MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to 
withdraw.   The posse's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to 
be overbearing and impudent. During the following week, six tons of hay 
belonging to one rancher were burned; some buildings, farm tools, 
two horses, plows, and hay owned by Bonito Lavato, a friendly interpreter 
for the company, and Pedro Chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed; 
and a store was broken into and robbed. District Attorney M& 
W& Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught 
committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch 
anyone.   Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook 
that he should leave New Mexico. His friends advised that it would 
be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by 
ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense, perpetuating 
the troubles. By early summer, he wrote from Laramie that he 
was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad 
way financially, so Pels sent him a draft for $100, warning that it 
was still not wise for him to return. Pels also sent a check for $100 
to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his 
grave.   Cattle stealing and killing, again serious during the 
spring of 1891, placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing 
position. They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property, 
thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on 
the Vermejo, and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary 
for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot. And 
the law virtually ignored the situation. The judge became ill just as 
the Colfax District Court convened, no substitute was brought in, 
no criminal cases heard, only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried, 
and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual 
three weeks. Pels complained: "Litigants and witnesses were 
put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact 
business; public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished, 
and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to 
be an absolute farce".   Word reached the company that the man 
behind these depredations was Manuel Gonzales, a man with many followers, 
including a number who were kept in line through fear of him. 
Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named Asher Jones, 
the warrant for his arrest had never been served. On May 19, a 
deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five 
miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan Jose 
Martinez. By 3:00 A&M& they reached his house and found it vacant. 
When they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby, 
they smashed down the door, broke the window, and threw lighted clothes 
wet with kerosene into the room. Still there was no Gonzales and 
the family would say nothing.   About 300 yards up the creek was 
a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a 
square. While prowling around these buildings, two of the posse recognized 
the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside. He was promised 
that no harm would befall him if he would come out, but he cursed 
and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door. The 
posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building 
would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him 
dead or alive. Again he refused. In deadly earnest, the besiegers methodically 
stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags 
inside, only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit 
the floor. When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer, 
taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside, square against 
the muzzle of a Winchester. Shot near the heart, he turned to 
one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away, three 
bullets following him. As he pushed open the door he fell on his 
face, one of his comrades pulling him inside.   Not realizing the 
seriousness of the wound, the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender 
the house would be burned down around him. Receiving no answer, 
they set the fire. When the house was about half consumed, his comrade 
ran to the door and threw up his hands, declaring repeatedly that 
he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel. Finding it true that he 
was not inside, the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes 
through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed 
covered by a blanket. Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside 
the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand. Shot six or eight 
times the body was draped with Russell's pistol, belt, and cartridges. 
There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who, though 
numbering in the fifties, had stood around on the hillside nearby 
without firing a shot during the entire attack.   Early the next 
morning, a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso Chavez, one of the 
posse members, was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home 
on the upper Vermejo. The sheriff and District Attorney Mills 
hastily swore 
out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed, 
according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr& I& P& George, 
and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman. 
Traveling all night, Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven 
o'clock May 22. Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a 
number of horsemen were sighted on the hills, disappearing at the posse's 
approach. A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against 
Chavez for taking part in the "murder" of Manuel Gonzales 
so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger. The men 
helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along 
with three other families desiring to leave.   The ten or more 
dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large, and 
Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe 
houses, defending themselves through loopholes, it would be most difficult 
to capture them. Thus he wired J& P& Lower and Sons of 
Denver: "Have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a 
house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot? If not, 
how long to order and what is the price"? He wisely decided that 
it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup, 
particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard. His problem 
then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean 
out the Vermejo by force immediately. 
The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location 
of the former electric light plant.   The Manchester Depot 
Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction 
of a sewer in that locality, and assessments were made for its maintenance. 
It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right 
into the Battenkill. Fire District No& 1 discussed its possible 
purchase in 1945, but considered it an unwise investment.   The 
sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses 
on the street. as new homes were built they were connected so that 
all residences south of School Street are served by it. B& J& 
Connell is the present treasurer and manager.   The 1946 town 
meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate 
and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and 
a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center, Depot, and Way's 
Lane. The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and 
Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report. The layout 
of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W& Taylor, who was the 
engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant. No figures were 
submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town.

The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal 
and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed 
sewage plant with its attendant facilities. The final step was a 
vote 
for a $230,000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by 
the 1959 town meeting, later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special 
town meeting June 21, 1960.   There the matter stands with 
the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of 
towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams. #@ TELEPHONE AND 
TELEGRAPH#

MANCHESTER'S unusual interest in telegraphy has 
often been attributed to the fact that the Rev& J& D& Wickham, 
headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary, was a personal friend and 
correspondent of the inventor, Samuel F& B& Morse. At any 
rate, Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system 
which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington.   In 
1846 Matthew B& Goodwin, jeweler and watchmaker, became the town's 
first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business 
"two doors north of the Equinox House" or "one door north 
of the Bank, Manchester, Vermont". Goodwin was telegrapher for 
the "American Telegraph Company" and the "Troy and Canada 
Junction Telegraph Company". Shares of capital stock at $15 each 
in the latter company were payable at the Bank of Manchester or at 
various other Vermont banks. A message of less than fifteen words to 
Bennington cost twenty-five cents.   By 1871 L& C& Orvis, 
manager of the "Western Union Telegraph Company", expressed 
willingness to send emergency telegrams on Sundays from his Village 
drugstore. Orvis even needed to hire an assistant, Clark J& Wait. 
The <Manchester Journal> commented editorially on the surprising 
amount of local telegraphic business.   In the fall of 1878, 
the "Popular Telegraph Line" was established between Manchester 
and Factory Point by the owners, Paul W& Orvis, Henry Gray, 
J& N& Hard, and Clark J& Wait. The line soon lived up 
to its name, as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a 
dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends 
on its capital stock.   In 1879 the same Clark Wait, with H& 
H& Holley of South Dorset, formed the "American Telegraph 
Line", extending from Manchester Depot via Factory Point and 
South Dorset to Dorset. Besides being most convenient, the line "soon 
proved a good investment for the owners". Telegraphers at the 
Depot at this time were Aaron C& Burr and Mark Manley of "Burr 
and Manley", dealers in lumber and dry goods.   Early equipment 
was very flimsy; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles, 
making communications impossible. But companies continued to spring 
up. By 1883 the "Battenkill Telegraph Company" was in existence 
and Alvin Pettibone was its president. Operating in 1887 was the 
"Valley Telegraph Line", officers of which were E& C& Orvis, 
president; H& K& Fowler, vice-president and secretary; 
J& N& Hard, treasurer; F& H& Walker, superintendent; 
H& S& Walker, assistant superintendent. Two companies now had 
headquarters with Clark J& Wait, who by then had his own drugstore 
at Factory Point- the "Northern Union Telegraph Company" 
and the "Western Union". Operators were Arthur Koop and 
Norman 
Taylor. Still existing on a "Northern Union" telegraph form 
is a typical peremptory message from Peru grocer J& J& Hapgood 
to Burton and Graves' store in Manchester- "Get and send 
by stage sure four pounds best Porterhouse or serloin stake, for Mrs& 
Hapgood send six sweet oranges".   About 1888 J& E& 
McNaughton of Barnumville and E& G& Bacon became proprietors 
of the "Green Mountain Telegraph Company", connecting all offices 
on the Western Union line and extending over the mountain from 
Barnumville to Peru, Londonderry, South Londonderry, Lowell Lake, 
Windham, North Windham, Grafton, Cambridgeport, Saxton's 
River, and Bellows Falls.   From 1896 until 1910 John H& 
Whipple was manager of Western Union at the Center in the drugstore 
he purchased from Clark Wait. The Village office of Western Union 
with George Towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in Hard's 
drugstore until 1905. During the summers, Towsley often needed 
the assistance of a company operator.   These were the years when 
people flocked to Manchester not only to play golf, which had come 
into vogue, but also to witness the Ekwanok Country Club tournaments. 
New Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed 
fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers. 
This boosted local telegraph business and Manchester basked in 
all the free advertising. In 1914 when the town was chosen for the 
U& S& Amateur Golf tournament, a representative hurried here from 
the Boston manager's office. In his wake came the District Traffic 
Supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession, ten of 
Boston's best, chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge 
of golf. During that tournament alone, some 250,000 words winged 
their way out of Manchester.   The old Morse system was replaced 
locally by the Simplex modern automatic method in 1929, when Ellamae 
Heckman (Wilcox) was manager of the Western Union office. During 
summers, business was so brisk that Mrs& Wilcox had two assistants 
and a messenger. She was succeeded by Clarence Goyette. Since 
that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad 
station at the Depot and shops at the Center back to the town clerk's 
office and drugstore at the Village. After being located for 
some years in the Village at the Equinox Pharmacy under the supervision 
of Mrs& Harry Mercier, it is presently located in the Hill 
and Dale Shop, Manchester Center.   The first known telephone 
line in Manchester was established in July 1883 between Burr and 
Manley's store at Manchester Depot and the Kent and Root Marble 
Company in South Dorset. This was extended the following year 
to include the railroad station agent's office and Thayer's Hotel 
at Factory Point. In November 1887 a line connecting several dwelling 
houses in Dorset was extended to Manchester Depot. Telephone 
wires from Louis Dufresne's house in East Manchester to the Dufresne 
lumber job near Bourn Pond were up about 1895. Eber L& Taylor 
of Manchester Depot recorded the setting of phone poles in East 
Dorset and Barnumville in his diary for 1906. These must have been 
for local calls strictly, as in May 1900 the "only long distance 
telephone" in town was transferred from C& B& Carleton's to 
Young's shoe store.   A small single switchboard was installed 
in the Village over Woodcock's hardware store (later E& H& 
Hemenway's). George Woodcock was manager and troubleshooter; 
Elizabeth Way was the first operator; and a night operator was also 
employed. Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones 
advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the <Manchester 
Journal>.   In 1918 the New England Telephone Company 
began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of U& 
S& Rte& 7 and what is now Memorial Avenue at Manchester Center. 
Service running through Barnumville and to Bennington County 
towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the "Gleason Telephone 
Company" in 1925, but major supervision of telephone lines 
in Manchester was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, 
which eventually gained all control. More aerial and underground 
equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care 
of the expanding business.   In 1931 Mrs& F& H& Briggs, 
agent and chief operator, who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' 
service, led agency offices in sales for the year with $2,490. 
William Hitchcock, who retired in 1938, was a veteran of thirty-four 
years' local service. Another veteran telephone operator was Edith 
Fleming Blackmer, who had been in the office forty years at the time 
of her death in 1960.   In 1932 Dorset received its own exchange, 
which made business easier for the Manchester office, but it was 
not until February 1953 that area service was extended to include Manchester 
and Dorset. This eliminated toll calls between the two towns. 
Within a month, calls were up seventy per cent. #@ ELECTRIC 
POWER#

ELECTRICITY plays such an important part in community life 
today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not 
available for daily use. Yet one has to go back only some sixty years.

The first mention of an electric plant in Manchester seems 
to be one installed in Reuben Colvin's and Houghton's gristmill 
on the West Branch in Factory Point. No records are available as 
to the date or extent of installation, but it may have been in 1896.

On June 14, 1900 the <Manchester Journal> reported that 
an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for Edward 
S& Isham at "Ormsby Hill". This was working by the end 
of August and giving satisfactory service.   In November 1900 
surveying was done under John Marsden on the east mountains to ascertain 
if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate 
an electric power plant. Nothing came of it, perhaps due to lack of 
opportunity for water storage.   The next step was construction 
by the Manchester Light and Power Company of a plant on the west 
bank of the Battenkill south of Union Street bridge. This was nearly 
completed May 23, 1901 with a promise of lights by June 10, but 
the first light did not go on until September 28. It was at the end 
of the sidewalk in front of the Dellwood Cemetery cottage.   The 
first directors of the Manchester Light and Power Company were 
John Marsden, M& L& Manley, William F& Orvis, George Smith, 
and John Blackmer. The officers were John Marsden, president; 
John C& Blackmer, vice-president; George Smith, treasurer; 
and William F& Orvis, secretary. Marsden was manager of the 
company for ten years and manager of its successor company, the Colonial 
Light and Power Company, for one year.   At about the time 
the Marsden enterprise was getting under way, the Vail Light and 
Lumber Company started construction of a chair stock factory on the 
site of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery, intending to 
use its surplus power for generating electricity. Manchester then had 
two competing power companies until 1904, when the Manchester Light 
and Power Company purchased the transmission system of the Vail 
Company. This was fortunate, as the Vail plant burned in 1905.

The Colonial Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont 
Hydro-Electric Corporation, which in turn was absorbed by the 
Central Vermont Public Service Corporation. The latter now furnishes 
the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at 
Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19, 1930 and 
was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers.

For a time following the abandonment of the local plant, 
electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with 
an emergency tie-in with the Vermont Marble Company system to the north. 
Some who have written on <Utopia> have treated it as "a learned 
diversion of a learned world", "a phantasy with which More amused 
himself", "a holiday work, a spontaneous overflow of intellectual 
high spirits, a revel of debate, paradox, comedy and invention". With 
respect to this view, two points are worth making. First, it appears 
to be based on the fact that on its title page <Utopia> is described 
as "festivus", "gay". It overlooks the other fact that 
it is described as "<Nec minus salutaris quam festivus>", "no 
less salutary than gay". It also overlooks the fact that in a rational 
lexicon, and quite clearly in More's lexicon, the opposite of 
serious is not gay but frivolous, and the opposite of gay is not serious 
but solemn. More believed that a man could be both serious and gay. 
That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional 
illusion, sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly 
believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because 
they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode 
of expression their authors are capable of. Secondly, to find a learned 
diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid 
brutalities of early sixteenth century wars, of the anguish of the poor 
and dispossessed, of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful 
requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising 
in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself. Indeed, 
it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius 
Professor of Ecclesiastical History, who fathered this most peculiar 
view, and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance 
English at Cambridge, who inherited it and is now its most eminent 
proponent.   But to return to the main line of our inquiry. It 
is doubtful that <Utopia> is still widely read because More was medieval 
or even because he was a martyr- indeed, it is likely that these 
days many who read <Utopia> with interest do not even know that 
its author was a martyr. <Utopia> is still widely read because in 
a sense More stood on the margin of modernity. And if he did stand 
on the margins of modernity, it was not in dying a martyr for such unity 
as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom. 
It was not even in writing Latin epigrams, sometimes bawdy ones, or 
in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study 
of Greek against the attack of conservative academics, or in attacking 
the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus's philological 
study of the New Testament. Similar literary exercises were the 
common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the 
sixteenth century. Had More's writings been wholly limited to such 
exercises, they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen 
or so other authors living in his time, whose works tenuously survive 
in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit 
of their very specialized occasions read those works.   More 
stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he 
wrote <Utopia>. And the evidence that he does, indeed, stand there 
derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual 
readers have responded to that book for the past century or so. 
Only one other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct 
a response, and only one other contemporary work- Niccolo Machiavelli 
and <The Prince>. Can we discover what it is in <Utopia> 
that has evoked this response? Remember that in seeking the modern 
in <Utopia> we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance 
there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing 
on the same inconceivable 
scale the relative importance of the medieval, the 
Renaissance, and the modern. The medieval was the most important 
to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More, the author of 
<Utopia>, in some intelligible relation with St& Thomas More, 
the martyr. To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance 
of Christian Humanism, the Renaissance elements are of primary 
concern. But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want 
to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want 
to know what is perennially new about <Utopia>.   What is new 
about it? To that question the answer is simple; it can be made 
in two words, Utopian communism. But it is an answer which opens the 
door wide to an onrush of objections and denials. Surely there is nothing 
new about communism. We find it in Plato's <republic>, and 
in <Utopia> More acknowledges his debt to that book. We find it 
in that "common way of life **h pleasing to Christ and **h still in 
use among the truest societies of Christians", that is, the better 
monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to 
Christianity. 
We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural condition 
which included the community of all possessions. This conception 
was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and 
theologians in the Middle Ages; and More was far too well read not 
to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.

But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's 
day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515, it 
is not communism as such that we are concerned with. We are concerned 
not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus: 
Platonic, Stoic, early Christian, monastic, canonist or theological 
communism; we are concerned with Utopian communism- that is, simply 
communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia, 
as More conceived it. Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity 
of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier 
types of communistic theory. We will achieve a more vivid sense 
of what it is by realizing what it is not.   In Plato's <Republic> 
communism is- to speak anachronistically- a communism of Janissaries. 
Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass, among 
whom private ownership prevails, the governing warrior elite. Moreover, 
it is too readily forgotten that in the <Republic> what 
gave 
the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an 
imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods, wives, 
and children, was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of 
the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the <Republic> 
ultimately returns. In More's <Utopia> communism is not 
a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass. Utopian 
communism applies to all Utopians. And in the economy of the 
book it is not peripheral but central. The concern of <Utopia> is 
with the <optimo reipublicae statu>, the best ordering of a civil society; 
and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism 
provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering.

To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community 
of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit, 
the monastic communities, is with an appropriate shift of adjectives, 
misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's <Republic>: 
in the <Republic> we have to do with an elite of physical 
and intellectual athletes, in the apostolic and monastic communities with 
an elite of spiritual and religious athletes. The apostolic community 
was literally an elite: chosen by Christ himself. And the monastic 
communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only 
after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic 
rigors, their spiritual athleticism.   Finally, the conception 
of the <natural> community of all possessions which originated 
with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time, although 
it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the 
Middle Ages. In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in 
the age of innocence before the Fall of Man. It did not serve to 
contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order, 
because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man 
had sinned. The actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic 
communism was adequately set forth by St& Gregory almost a 
millenium before More wrote <Utopia>.   "The soil is common 
to all men **h. When we give the necessities of life to the poor, 
we restore to them what is already theirs. We should think of it more 
as an act of justice than compassion".   Because community not 
severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely 
unalterable right to what is his. Indeed, of all that is his every 
man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated 
to regard himself as a custodian. He is a trustee for the common good, 
however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of 
property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund, 
wisely or unwisely, entrusted to his keeping. In contrast to this 
Stoic-patristic view, <Utopia> implies that the nature of man is such 
that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of 
municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness 
in a sieve. The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions. In 
a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the 
function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to 
a small voice so often still.   In all the respects just 
indicated 
Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community 
of possessions and living plays a role. Neither from one of these 
conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced. We do 
not deny originality to the <Agamemnon> because Aeschylus found the 
tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks. In 
a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may 
find in it, Utopian communism remains, as an integral whole, original- 
a new thing. It is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very 
few new things in <Utopia>; most of the rest is medieval or humanist 
or part of an old tradition of social criticism. But to say that 
at a moment in history something is <new> is not necessarily to say 
that it is modern; and for this statement the best evidence comes 
within the five years following the publication of <Utopia>, when 
Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine's 
encounter with man. New, indeed, is Luther's perception, but 
not modern, as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible 
to modern students what Luther was getting at.   Although Utopian 
communism is both new in 1516 and also modern, it is not modern communism 
or even modern socialism, as they exist or have ever existed in 
theory or in practice. Consider the features of Utopian communism: 
generous public provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections 
of all officers including priests, meals taken publicly in common 
refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens; 
even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor 
a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars, and careful measures 
to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property, no money; 
no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services, and therefore 
no market in the economic sense of the term. Whatever the merits of 
its intent, Utopian communism is far too naive, far too crude, to suit 
any modern socialist or communist. It is not the details of Utopian 
communism that make <Utopia> modern, it is the spirit, the attitude 
of mind that informs those details. What that spirit and attitude 
were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts 
with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history, the 
one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the 
Church Fathers of Late Antiquity.

During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings 
and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration 
of Independence. During the Brown trial, however, the state's 
most powerful Democratic newspaper, the Providence <Daily Post>, 
stated that Brown was a murderer, a man of blood, and that he and 
his associates, with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists, 
had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow 
of state and federal governments. The Providence <Daily Journal> 
answered the <Daily Post> by stating that the raid of John 
Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that "He 
was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party, who proclaim 
as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere 
with slavery in the states". The two major newspapers in Providence 
continued, throughout the crisis, to accuse each other of misrepresenting 
the facts and attempting to falsify history.   While the 
<Daily Post> continued to accuse Republicans and the <Daily Journal> 
continued to accuse Democrats, the Woonsocket <Patriot> complained 
that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly 
haste to condemn Brown and his men. Editor Foss stated, "Of their 
guilt **h there can be no doubt **h but they are entitled to sufficient 
time to prepare for trial, and **h a fair trial". The Providence 
<Daily Post> thought that there were probably good reasons for 
the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing 
gained by a delay would be calmer feelings. The Providence <Daily 
Journal> stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident, the 
South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace.

On October 31, 1859, John Brown was found guilty of treason 
against the state of Virginia, inciting slave rebellion, and murder. 
For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday, 
December 2, 1859. Upon receiving the news, Northern writers, editors, 
and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states, 
particularly Virginia.   Although Rhode Islanders were preparing 
for the state elections, they watched John Brown's trial with 
extreme interest. On Wednesday morning, November 2, 1859, the Providence 
<Daily Journal> stated that although Brown justly deserved 
the extreme penalty, no man, however criminal, ought to suffer the penalty 
without a fairer trial. The editor's main criticism of the trial 
was the haste with which it was conducted. The readers of the Providence 
<Daily Post>, however, learned that it was generally conceded 
that "Old Brown" had a fair trial. Concerning the sentence 
the editor asked, "What else can Virginia do than to hang the men 
who have 
defied her laws, organized treason, and butchered her citizens".

In the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction 
to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical. J& 
Wheaton Smith, editor of the Warren <Telegraph> stated that "the 
ends of justice must be satisfied, a solitary example must be set, 
in order that all those misnamed philantropists [<sic>], who, actuated 
by a blind zeal, dare to instigate riot, treason, and murder, may 
heed it and shape their future course accordingly". The editor of 
the Newport <Advertiser> could discover no evidence of extenuating 
circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception 
to the infliction of capital punishment.   In direct contrast 
to the other Rhode Island editors, Samuel S& Foss of the Woonsocket 
<Patriot> outwardly condemned the trial as being completely 
unfair. Concerning the sentence, Foss wrote, "If it be possible 
**h that mercy shall override vengeance **h and that John Brown's 
sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment, it would be well- well 
for the country **h and for Virginia".   Despite the excitement 
being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown, Rhode Islanders 
turned their attention to the state elections. The state had 
elected Republican candidates in the past two years. There was no doubt 
as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the 
state. If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state 
offices by majorities, the failure was due to a lingering remnant 
of the Know-Nothing party, which called itself the American Republican 
party. The American Republicans and the Republicans both nominated 
Lieutenant-Governor Turner for governor. Elisha R& Potter 
was the Democratic candidate. The results of the election of 1859 
found Republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor 
and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two Congressional offices 
from the eastern and western sections of the state.   During 
the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention 
of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers. On November 
7, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> reprinted a letter sent 
to John Brown from "E& B&", a Quaker lady in Newport. In 
reference to Brown's raid she wrote, "though we are non-resistants 
and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal 
weapons **h we know thee was anemated [<sic>] by the most generous 
and philanthropic motives". "E& B&" compared John Brown 
to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from 
oppression. In contrast to "E& B&", most Rhode Islanders 
hardly thought of John Brown as being another Moses. Most attempts 
to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive 
audience in Rhode Island.   On Wednesday evening, November 
23, 1859, in Warren, Rev& Mark Trafton of New Bedford, gave 
a "Mission of Sympathy" lecture in which he favorably viewed the 
Harper's Ferry insurrection. The Warren <Telegraph> stated 
that many of Rev& Trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored 
strongly of radicalism and fanaticism. In its account of the Trafton 
lecture, the Providence <Daily Post> said that the remarks 
of 
Rev& Trafton made the people indignant.   No sympathy or admiration 
for Brown could be found in the Providence <Daily Post>, 
for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison 
who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy. The Providence 
<Daily Journal>, however, stated that Brown's courage, bravery, 
and heroism "in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives 
something of dignity even to a bad one". The Woonsocket <Patriot> 
admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment 
"but he should no more be hung than Henry A& Wise or James 
Buchanan". The Newport <Mercury> exhibited more concern over 
the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it 
did over the development of sympathy for him.   In her letter 
to John Brown, "E& B&", the Quakeress from Newport, had 
suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for 
seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington. During 
the latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution, 
it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in "E& B&'s" 
suggestion. On November 22, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> 
stated that although Brown's "pluck" and honest fanaticism 
must be admired, any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics 
to imitate his actions. A week later the <Daily Journal> 
had 
discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a 
meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution. The editor 
of the <Daily Journal> warned, "**h that if such a demonstration 
be made, it will not find support or countenance from any of the men 
whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence". 
The Providence <Daily Post>'s editor wrote that he could 
not 
believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence. 
He further called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting 
and avoid disgrace.   On December 2, 1859, John Brown was 
hanged at Charles Town, Virginia. Extraordinary precautions were 
taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within 
the enclosure surrounding the scaffold. In many Northern towns and 
cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled. Such was not 
the case in Rhode Island. The <only> public demonstration in honor 
of John Brown was held at Pratt's Hall in Providence, on the 
day of his execution.   Despite the opposition of the city newspapers, 
the Pratt Hall meeting "brought together a very respectable 
audience, composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years 
for their radical views upon the subject of slavery, of many of our 
colored citizens, and of those who were attracted to the place by the 
novelty of such a gathering". Seated on the platform were Amos C& 
Barstow, ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove 
manufacturer; Thomas Davis, an uncompromising Garrisonian; the 
Reverend Augustus Woodbury, a Unitarian minister; the Reverend 
George T& Day, a Free-Will Baptist; Daniel w& Vaughan, 
and William H& H& Clements. The latter two were appointed secretaries. 
The first speaker was Amos C& Barstow who had been unanimously 
chosen president of the meeting. He spoke of his desire to promote 
the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John 
Brown of Harper's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's 
colonial period. Barstow concluded that as Rhode Island's John 
Brown became a canonized hero, if not a saint, so would it be with 
John Brown of Harper's Ferry.   The next speaker was George 
T& Day. Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds, 
Day said that, "Brown is no common criminal; his deed was not 
below, but above the law". 
Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his 
disapproval of Brown's attempt at servile insurrection, his admiration 
of Brown's character, and his opposition to slavery. Woodbury's 
remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times 
and once there was hissing.   The fourth and last speaker was Thomas 
Davis. By this time large numbers of the audience had left the 
hall. Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling 
of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the 
citizens and all the newspapers of the city. He said that the propriety 
or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled 
by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments. 
In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for 
Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they "are 
liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding 
men whom the laws have condemned". He recalled that in Rhode Island 
a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man (Thomas W& 
Dorr) proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law 
of the land and the principles of human liberty. At the close of Davis' 
speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president, 
and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously:

Whereas, John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring 
to deliver those who are denied all rights **h and is this day doomed 
to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper: 
Therefore,   Resolved that, while we most decidedly disapprove 
the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects, yet **h in his 
willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom, we still 
recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit 
which true men have always admired and which history never fails 
to honor.   Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas, 
occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on 
the propagation of slavery in that territory, call for a charitable 
judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism 
from which he had suffered, and commend his family to the special 
sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice.

Resolved **h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for 
resolute action.   Resolved, that we find in this fearful tragedy 
at Harper's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the 
evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible **h.

On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the 
Providence <Daily Journal> wrote that although the meeting was 
milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes, 
it could have been avoided completely. 
Rather than being deceived, the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing objects 
in space, it sees nothing more than- a picture.   Through 
1911 and 1912, as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to 
the literal surface became harder and harder to deny, the task of keeping 
the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving 
contrivances. To reinforce, and sometimes to replace, the simulated 
typography, Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign 
substances with their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise 
called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective 
over much larger areas. In certain other pictures, however, Braque began 
to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing. 
These areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern, stated the 
literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting 
contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could 
be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional perspective; 
that is, by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted 
within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography 
except near the surface.   The accumulation of such devices, 
however, soon had the effect of telescoping, even while separating, 
surface and depth. The process of flattening seemed inexorable, and it 
became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to 
prevent it from fusing with the illusion. It was for this reason, and 
no other that I can see, that in September 1912, Braque took the radical 
and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain 
wallpaper to a drawing on paper, instead of trying to simulate 
its texture in paint. Picasso says that he himself had already made 
his first collage toward the end of 1911, when he glued a piece of 
imitation-caning 
oilcloth to a painting on canvas. It is true that his first 
collage looks more Analytical than Braque's, which would confirm 
the date he assigns it. But it is also true that Braque was the 
consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography; 
and moreover, he had already begun to broaden and simplify the 
facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910. 
##

When we examine what each master says was his first collage we 
see that much the same thing happens in each. (It makes no real difference 
that Braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal, 
while Picasso's is on canvas and eked out in oil.) By its greater 
corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness, the affixed paper 
or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more 
vivid <idea> of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures 
had ever done. But here again, the surface-declaring device both 
overshoots and falls short of its aim. For the illusion of depth created 
by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else 
gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief, which gives 
way in turn, and with equal immediacy, to an illusion that seems 
to contain both- or neither.   Because of the size of the areas 
it covers, the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness <bodily>, 
as more than an indication or sign. Literal flatness now tends to 
assert itself as the main event of the picture, and the device boomerangs: 
the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before. 
Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing 
it, the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it, and 
the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with 
which to finish as well as start his picture. The actual surface 
becomes both ground and background, and it turns out- suddenly and paradoxically- 
that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion 
is in <front> of, <upon>, the surface. In their very first collages, 
Braque and Picasso draw or paint <over> and <on> the affixed 
paper or cloth, so that certain of the principal features of their 
subjects <as depicted> seem to thrust out into real, bas-relief space- 
or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains 
imbedded in, or flat upon, the surface. And the surface is driven back, 
in its very surfaceness, only by this contrast.   In the upper 
center of Braque's first collage, <Fruit Dish> (in Douglas 
Cooper's collection), a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally 
vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture 
plane. The <trompe-l'oeil> illusion here is no longer enclosed 
between parallel flatnesses, but seems to thrust through the surface 
of the drawing paper and establish depth <on top> of it. Yet the 
violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper, and the 
only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering, 
manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture 
plane so that it does not "jump". At the same time, the wallpaper 
strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and 
patches of shading charcoaled upon them, and by their placing in relation 
to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed 
back by <their> placing, and by contrast with the corporeality 
of the woodgraining. Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps 
changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and 
it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts 
of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with 
the surface. And the same thing, more or less, can be said of the contents 
of Picasso's first collage.   In later collages of both 
masters, a variety of extraneous materials are used, sometimes in the 
same work, and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving 
and eye-undeceiving device they can think of. The area adjacent 
to one edge of a piece of affixed material- or simply of a painted-in 
form- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface, while 
something will be drawn, painted or even pasted over another part of 
the same shape to drive it back into depth. Planes defined as parallel 
to the surface also cut through it into real space, and a depth is 
suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially. 
All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to 
encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it. 
Flatness may now monopolize everything, but it is a flatness become 
so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least 
an optical if not, properly speaking, a pictorial illusion. Depicted, 
Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal, 
undepicted kind, but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms 
the undepicted kind- and it does so, moreover, without depriving 
the latter of its literalness; rather, it underpins and reinforces 
that literalness, re-creates it. ##

Out of this re-created literalness, 
the Cubist subject reemerged. For it had turned out, by a 
further paradox of Cubism, that the means to an illusion of depth and 
plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation 
or imaging. In the Analytical phase of their Cubism, Braque 
and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply 
in order to preserve it; they had also had to <generalize> it- 
to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted 
from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely 
as the illusion of depth and relief <as such:> as a disembodied 
attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself. 
In order to be saved, plasticity had had to be isolated; and 
as the aspect of the subject 
was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable 
and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity 
was isolated under the Cubist method, the subject itself became largely 
unrecognizable. Cubism, in its 1911-1912 phase (which the French, 
with justice, call "hermetic") was on the verge of abstract art.

It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with 
a unique dilemma: they had to choose <between> illusion and representation. 
If they opted for illusion, it could only be illusion per se- 
an illusion of depth, and of relief, so general and abstracted as 
to exclude the representation of individual objects. If, on the other 
hand, they opted for representation, it had to be representation per 
se- representation as image pure and simple, without connotations (at 
least, without more than schematic ones) of the three-dimensional space 
in which the objects represented originally existed. It was the 
collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational 
could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface 
now that illusion and representation had become, for the first time, 
mutually exclusive alternatives.   In the end, Picasso and Braque 
plumped for the representational, and it would seem they did so 
deliberately. (This provides whatever real justification there is for 
the talk about "reality".) But the inner, formal logic of Cubism, 
as it worked itself out through the collage, had just as much to do 
with shaping their decision. When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical 
Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large, dense shapes 
formed by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to coalesce- 
become "synthesized"- into larger planar shapes themselves 
simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane. Left 
in their previous atom-like smallness, they would have cut away too abruptly 
into depth; and the broad, opaque shapes of pasted paper would 
have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane. 
Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves 
as <independent> shapes, and to the extent that they are flat, 
they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent silhouettes 
are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject 
from which a picture starts (if it does start from a subject). It was 
because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason- that 
is, because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage 
as a <shape>- that the identity of depicted objects, or at least 
parts of them, re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's <papiers colles> 
and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as 
flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly in 
oil before the end of 1913.   Analytical Cubism came to an end 
in the collage, but not conclusively; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully 
begin there. Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated 
into oil, and transformed by this translation, did Cubism become 
an affair of positive color and flat, interlocking silhouettes whose legibility 
and placement created allusions to, if not the illusion of, 
unmistakable three-dimensional identities.   Synthetic Cubism began 
with Picasso alone, late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the 
point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from 
Braque, never again to relinquish it. But even before that, Picasso 
had glimpsed and entered, for a moment, a certain revolutionary path 
in which no one had preceded him. It was as though, in that instant, 
he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly 
tried to escape all the way back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality. 
This he did by using utterly literal means to carry 
the forward push of the collage (and of Cubism in general) <literally> 
into the literal space in front of the picture plane.   Some 
time in 1912, Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the 
shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper 
and four taut strings, thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real 
and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture 
plane. The affixed elements of collage were extruded, as it were, 
and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief. 
(Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper.) And without 
high density in the core, rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained 
economically, let alone built from scratch at today's prices. 
However, the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever. 
The new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways, including 
the grade-constructed accesses, occupies by itself no less than <eighty 
acres> of downtown land, one-eighth of a square mile, an area 
about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York. It is hard to believe 
that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law 
calls "the highest and best use" of centrally located urban land. 
As it affects the city's fiscal situation, such an interchange is 
ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should 
be taxed to pay for the city services. Subways improved land values 
without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less (because the 
garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot), and reduce 
the acreage that can be taxed. Downtown Los Angeles is already 
two-thirds freeway, interchange, street, parking lot and garage- one 
of those preposterous "if" statistics has already come to pass.

The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and 
mitigates the access problem, but it also acts inevitably as an artificial, 
isolating boundary. City planners do not always use this boundary 
as effectively as they might. Less ambitious freeway plans may be 
more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges are 
raised, allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking 
areas below the ramp. ##

Meanwhile, the automobile and its friend 
the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance. 
In ever greater numbers, factories are locating in the suburbs or 
in "industrial parks" removed from the city's political jurisdiction. 
The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry, 
which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants 
enough land area to do the entire job on one floor. To light industry, 
the economies of being on one floor are much slighter, but efficiency 
engineers usually believe in them, and manufacturers looking for 
ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers.

This movement of industry away from the central cities 
is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe. It 
is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern 
of virtually all American cities. The big factories which are 
relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in 
Akron, Chrysler's Detroit plants, U&S&Steel's Pittsburgh 
works- often began on these sites at a time when <that> was the 
edge of the city, yet close to transport (river), storage (piers) and 
power (river). The "leapfrog" was a phenomenon of the railroad and 
the steam turbine, and the time when the belts of residence surrounding 
the old factory area were not yet blighted.   The truck and 
the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his 
plant site. Until internal combustion became cheap, he had to be near 
a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community 
of lower-class homes. The railroad siding is still important- it 
is usually, though not always, true that long-haul shipment by rail is 
cheaper than trucking. But anybody who promises a substantial volume 
of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these 
days, and many businesses can live without the railroad. And there 
are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking 
lot, which can be reached by driving across or against the usual 
pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines, is actually 
more convenient than the walk-to factory.   Willow Run, General 
Electric's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse, the 
Pentagon, Boeing in Seattle, Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles, 
the new automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these is 
substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit. 
They are all suburban plants, relying on the roads to keep them supplied 
with workers. And wherever the new thruways go up their banks are 
lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry. The 
drive along Massachusetts' Route 128, the by-pass which makes an 
arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston, may be a vision of the future.

The future could be worse. The plants along Route 128 
are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks 
and trees. They can even be rather grand, like Edward Land's monument 
to the astonishing success of Polaroid. But they deny the values 
of the city- the crowded, competitive, tolerant city, the "melting 
pot" which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities. 
They are segregated businesses, combining again on one site 
the factory and the office, drawing their work force from segregated 
communities. It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts' 
Route 128 draw most of their income either from the government 
in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements, or from the exploitation 
of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly. ##

While 
the factories were always the center of the labor market, they were 
often on the city's periphery. In spreading the factories even farther, 
the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth 
pattern of the cities. Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's 
motel has been relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation 
is becoming harder to find every year. What hurts most is the damage 
the automobile has done to central-city retailing, especially in 
those cities where public transit is feeble.   Some retailing, 
of course, always spreads with the population- grocery stores, drugstores, 
local haberdasheries and dress shops, candy stores and the like. 
But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a 
new bedroom set or a winter coat, an Easter bonnet, a bicycle for Junior- 
the family set off for the downtown department store, where the 
selection would be greatest. Department stores congregated in the 
"one hundred per cent location", where all the transit lines converged. 
These stores are still there, but the volume of the "downtown 
store" has been on a relative decline, while in many cities the suburban 
"branch" sells more and more dry goods. If the retailer and 
hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing, however, his dollar 
volume continues to rise, and it is dollars which you put in the 
bank.   In most discussions of this phenomenon, the figures are 
substantially inflated. No suburban shopping-center branch- not even 
Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit- does anything like 
the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise 
to be found in the home store. Telephone orders distort the 
picture: the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city 
number if both are listed in an advertisement, especially if 
the local call eliminates city sales tax. The suburban branch is thereby 
credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass 
doors had never opened. Accounting procedures which continue to charge 
a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store 
make the branches seem more profitable than they are. In many cases 
that statement "We break even on our downtown operation and make money 
on our branches" would be turned around if the cost analysis were 
recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store. Fear of the 
competition- always a great motivating force in the American economy- 
makes retailers who do <not> have suburban operations exaggerate 
both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new 
branches. The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are 
uneconomical, that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important 
as it was downtown, and that even highly suburbanized cities will 
support only so many big branches. Moreover, the cost of operations 
is always high in <any> new store, as the conservative bankers who 
act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover.

When all has been said, however, the big branch store remains a major 
break with history in the development of American retailing. Just 
as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant 
to the worker with a car, the trip to the shopping center may seem far 
easier than to the downtown department store, though both are the same 
distance from home. Indeed, there are some cities where the suburban 
shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown. 
Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St& Louis 
have been driving across the Mississippi, through the heart of downtown 
St& Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping, simply 
because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart 
of town. To the extent that the problem is merely parking, an aggressive 
downtown management, like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus, 
Ohio, can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot 
next door. If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened 
away from downtown by traffic problems, however, the city store 
can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways 
or await the completion of the federal highway program. And if the 
affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with "nice 
people", rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports 
the downtown department store, the central location may be in serious 
trouble. Today, according to land economist Homer Hoyt, shopping 
centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres 
of land, which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's 
Central Business Districts put together.   The downtown 
store continues to offer the great inducement of variety, both within 
its gates and across the street, where other department stores are immediately 
convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available 
before making up her mind. If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver 
world of retailing, it seems likely that the suburban branch will 
come to dominate children's clothing (taking the kid downtown is 
too much of a production), household gadgetry and the discount business 
in big-ticket items. Department stores were built on dry goods, especially 
ladies' fashions, and in this area, in the long run, the suburban 
branches will be hard put to compete against downtown. If this 
analysis is correct, the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's 
cost accountants refuse to acknowledge, marginal operations 
rather than major factors.   Historically in America the appeal 
of cities has been their color and life, the variety of experience 
they offered. "How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm"? was 
a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree. Though 
Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious 
belief, they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality 
of downtown. Only a radical change in the nature of the population in 
the central city would be likely to destroy this preference- and we 
must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change, 
gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians, is actually upon us. 

#4. SUBURBS AND NEGROES#

In their book <American Skyline,> 
Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's 
New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility- 
a fine ironical argument, when you consider how suburbanites tend to 
vote. The first superhighways- New York's Henry Hudson and Chicago's 
Lake Shore, San Francisco's Bay Bridge and its approaches, 
a good slice of the Pennsylvania Turnpike- were built as 
part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression. 
At the same time, Roosevelt's Federal Housing Administration, 
coupled with Henry Morgenthau's cheap-money policy, permitted 
ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes. Bankers 
who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house 
itself got that security from the U& S& government; householders 
who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest 
mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per 
cent, under government aegis. 
Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century, the grand stream 
of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance 
in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington.

The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris 
of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution, and tended 
to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were 
easy to find. But it is a great conception. The open ceiling, with 
allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky: 
the closed frieze, formally divided into historical scenes and tightly 
tied to the stone walls, belong in their large ordering to the line 
of Correggio and his Baroque followers. The descent may be remote, 
but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance 
in the United States.   Constantino Brumidi designed the 
decorative scheme as a whole, in collaboration with the architect Charles 
U& Walter, at the time when plans were being made to replace 
the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure. 
After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish 
the canopy fresco, and slightly less than half the frieze, beginning 
with the Liberty group opposite the East door, and ending with William 
Penn, all but one leg, when a tragic accident ended his career. 
He left at his death sketches, drawn to scale, for the rest of the circle. 
These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini, 
who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania 
and noting in pencil, in Italian, that he "began at this point".

When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six 
feet of empty frieze were left over. A blank undecorated void, plastered 
in roughcast, disfigured the wall of the Rotunda until 1951. Then, 
advised by the Architect of the Capitol, the Joint Committee 
for the Library, traditionally responsible for the works of art in the 
building, ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco, to show 
"the Peace after the Civil War", "the Spanish-American War", 
and "the Birth of Aviation", to match as nearly as feasible 
Brumidi's technique and composition. Later the cleaning and restoration 
were ordered, first of the older part of the frieze, finally of 
the canopy. What follows is therefore a description of three separate 
undertakings, the new frescoing of the gap, and the successive essays 
in conservation, with some discussion of problems that arose in connection 
with each.   For the use of students and future restorers, 
a full, day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings, complete 
technical reports on what we found and what we did. These may be consulted 
in the office of the Architect of the Capitol, or the Library 
of Congress.   The first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished 
length of frieze, a jumble of roughcast and finish coats, all 
in 
bad condition. It was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks, 
and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree 
with the older artists' preparation, with a mortar, one part slaked 
lime, three parts sand, to be put on in two layers. Cartoons were drawn 
full size, after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities. 
There was some difficulty here. One had to manage the given subjects, 
three diverse recent events, so as to make them part of a classical 
frieze,- that is, a pattern of large figures filling the space, 
with not much else, against a blank background. Moreover, all three 
representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the 
length Brumidi allowed for each one of his.   When it was all 
arranged to fit, and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement 
in the frieze, the cartoons were tried in place. The scaffolding, a 
confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above, was strong and 
safe, but obscured visibility. Nothing could be seen from the floor, 
but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses; and we were 
able to decide on some amplification of scale. To be sure of matching 
color as well as form, pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast, 
and large samples painted in fresco, then left two months to dry 
out to their final key. Later it was gratifying to note that they had 
set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came.   The 
scaffold was the length of the space to be painted. What bits of Brumidi 
and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good 
order, though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust. Washed, 
they came out surprisingly clear and bright. It could be seen that 
both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster, one half inch, 
and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described 
by Cennino Cennini in the 14th Century, and current in Italy 
to this day. That is, they used opaque color throughout, getting solid 
highlights with active lime white. Painting "a secco" is much 
in evidence. A brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows, and 
much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat. This brown 
is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint. 
In our own practice, to have the last "intonaco" plaster coat thick 
enough to match, and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in 
drying, 
we found that it had to be put on in two layers, letting the first 
set awhile before applying the second. The mortar was three parts sand 
to two of lime. Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol 
basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us; 
but to make it stiffer, of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking, 
we added a little hydrated lime- hard on the hands, but we 
could see no other disadvantage. I am told that a mortar longer slaked 
might have remained longer in condition for painting. As it was, it 
took the pigment well for six hours, enough for our purpose, and held 
it firmly in setting. It was obvious that to match Brumidi, white must 
be mixed with all but the darkest tones. Lime white, hard and brilliant, 
has a tendency to "jump" away from the other colors in drying, 
and also by its capacity to set, to preclude the use of ready-made 
gradations, so useful in decorative work. In older Italian practice, 
lime, dried and reground "bianco sangiovanni", entered into such 
prepared shades. For convenience we chose a stronger pigment, 
unknown 
to the early Italians or to Brumidi, titanium oxide, reserving the 
active lime white for highest lights, put on at the end of the day's 
stint. Other pigments were mostly raw umber, some burnt umber, and 
a little yellow ochre. This last was probably not in Brumidi's palette, 
but was needed to take the chill, bluish look off the new work next 
to the old, where softening effects 
of time were seen, even after thorough 
cleaning. The use of "secco" we tried to restrict to covering 
joints. Experience showed, however, that it is very difficult to 
paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty 
and uneven. Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this 
same problem. We were forced, as they were, to work a good deal of 
tempera into background and dark areas. We made it by Doerner's 
recipe, five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty; 
ground together they made a strong adhesive, which became waterproof 
in drying.   Figure 1 was taken in 1953. The new part is finished. 
On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group, as it looked after 
cleaning operations, which had not yet come around to the other end; 
where, of Costaggini, only some foliage has been washed, at the point 
where his work stopped. One is led to speculate as to why the empty 
space was there, left for our century to finish. Costaggini said it 
was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle. 
Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed 
and mutilated his father's designs, ambitiously coveting a bit he 
could claim for his very own. This question might be settled by comparing 
the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions 
noted, presumably in Brumidi's hand, above the various sections of 
his long preparatory drawing, which has been kept. Whose ever 
fault, 
it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with 
his "histories" and come full circle with the scene of the discovery 
of California gold. In painting a fresco, the handling of wet mortar 
compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right, 
not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering. At the 
very first, then, Brumidi was required, by the classically pyramidal 
shape of his central group, to fill in the triangular space above the 
seated girl on Liberty's right, before starting on the allegorical 
figures themselves. Here he put a small man, whose missing hands 
might have left his function doubtful, until comparison with the first 
sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning, this 
was to be the closing figure of the party of "forty-niners", and 
was to hold a basket. One sees Costaggini's rendering of the same 
figure more than thirty feet away. The photograph, Figure 1 of the completed 
frieze, shows how, having been separated from his fellows in 
useless isolation for eighty years, he has now been given a hand, and 
by juxtaposition (and the permission of the Committee), given a new job, 
to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 
1903.   The startlingly bright effect of the first washings led 
the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini cycle cleaned 
and restored to go with them. The fixed wooden scaffold was removed, 
and, so as to reach all the frieze, one of pipe, on wheels, built 
up from the floor. Every few days, in the early morning, as the work 
progressed, twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the 
plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda 
pavement, supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting.   On this 
giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor, after 
a first dusting, we began to wash. A most useful tool for wetting the 
surface without running down was made from a greenhouse "mist spray" 
nozzle welded to a hose connection, to be used at low water pressure. 
A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower. One 
man sprayed, with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting. A second 
assistant mopped with two sponges. In parts a repeated sponging was 
needed, but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore 
the original brightness. No soap or other cleaning agent was used that 
might bring in unwanted chemical reactions. The painting "a fresco" 
stood up superbly; a little of the "secco" came off. Necessary 
retouching was put on at once. Altogether we found the craftsmanship 
first rate, especially Brumidi's. We were greatly helped by 
there being no traces of former restoring. Apparently not more than 
dusting had ever been done, and not much of that. The plaster was sound, 
the intonaco firmly attached all over, and the pigment solidly incorporated 
with it in all but a few unimportant places.   The greatest 
source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings 
above, soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime, 
very conspicuous even after cleaning, particularly in the "Landing 
of Columbus", "Oglethorpe and the Indians", and "Yorktown". 
Here the Architect, referring to the use of the Capitol as a 
public building, not a museum, requested some repainting to maintain decorative 
effect, rather than leaving blank, unsightly patches. 
These frescos have had no care for eighty years. With naked gas jets 
below and leaky windows above, enough to ruin wall paintings in any 
medium, they have survived, in a building long unheated in winter, hot 
and damp under the iron dome in summer.

Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most 
part unknown to me. It may well be that, when Rudy Pozzatti and I 
visited your country last spring, you were living and working close 
to the places we saw and the streets we walked. As American artists, 
it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as 
possible. This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts 
to meet and talk with you been more successful. Even though we did not 
see many of your faces, it appears now quite evident that a considerable 
number of your profession heard, from those whom we had the fortune 
to encounter, that we had been in your midst. I am very pleased that 
quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to 
hear of our reactions and experiences in the U&S&S&R&. I 
can well understand your curiosity. We, ourselves, are always eager 
to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live. it is 
my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the 
good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists.   There should 
be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter. Pozzatti 
and I endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the 
prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes. The time-span 
of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert 
on anything I saw. Too much damage is done by "experts" who 
have spent even less time, if any at all, in the U&S&S&R&.

Nevertheless I consider it reasonable, because of my commitment 
as an artist, to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative 
individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific 
geo-political interests. If this attitude is seriously questioned 
in the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily follow that the majority 
of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for 
clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view. It is 
a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen 
are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the 
plight of a minority, such as artists, in any social order. I encountered 
many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union 
about my reactions to that experience. That which I found most 
profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction. 
Almost as if I were talking about something quite unreal. Apparently 
this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen 
objectively, or at least dispassionately, to individual impressions 
of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments. Personal 
predispositions tend to blunt the ear and, in turn, the voice 
as well. I cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat 
unusual travelogue. I am equally impatient with the shrug of the 
shoulder, shake of the head of those who no longer care because they 
have known it for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are 
romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word "Revolution"; 
the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who 
try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical 
horizons. Difficult as it may have been at times, Pozzatti and I saw 
enough, talked to enough artists, historians and others to realize 
that the issue is quite clear. Artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends 
of humanity; they are small in number and their contribution is not 
immediately decisive in everyday life. By themselves they may not 
be able to save the life on this planet, but without them there would 
be very little left worth saving.   It cannot be said that our 
very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one. 
On that cold, but bright, April day we were guests of your government 
in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the poeple's celebration 
for Yuri Gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat 
more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces 
of the Kremlin. If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of 
a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national 
achievement, our last day, to us at least, was equally impressive and 
very moving, even though the crowds were absent and there was almost 
complete silence. We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country 
just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of 
a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to 
the point of foregoing the highest international honor. The grave, about 
half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church, 
rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green, 
the sounds of birds, the silence of other graves and the casual 
paths through small forests. Just yesterday we had met and talked with 
a living writer, a contemporary of the dead poet, who is known for his 
ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously. 
But today we were aware of only two men. One had taken a flight into 
uncharted space, in the service of science, to return as a living hero. 
The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted 
space of the human spirit. The flowers on his grave attested to the 
fact that he as well was somebody's hero.   These two recollections 
form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which, 
to me at least, symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical 
conflict between materialism and humanism. A struggle that is 
being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest. The 
prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in 
your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was 
elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity. The socialist 
environment, it was stated, had cross-fertilized these two extreme 
seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit. When I speculated 
on one such occasion that the new growth, like other mutations, 
might be unable to propagate, I was immediately accused of preaching 
racial prejudice. I could not bring myself to answer that "some 
of my best friends are non-propagating mules".   This kind of 
reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to. After a while 
we were perhaps less surprised, but still puzzled, when a friendly 
discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and 
illogical comparisons. A chance remark about Lenin's sealed train 
brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to George Washington's 
cherry tree. Theories of the behavior pattern of population masses 
were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern 
of gaseous masses. No wonder that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty 
in remembering the real purpose of our presence, namely, Cultural 
Exchange.   Typical of such an experience was the occasion 
of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union 
of Soviet Artists. We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our 
first informal meeting with a number of Moscow's artists. Instead, 
we became involved in a series of friendly, but overly formal, welcoming 
addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind. The terms 
of friendship, understanding, cooperation, etc&, tend to become 
somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use. I can only 
hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between 
our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion. 
The presiding female functionary, of massive proportions and forbidding 
appearance, initially did not contribute to the expressions of 
friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing 
the arts. It was only after we had responded, with what I fear were 
similar cliches, that she went into action by questioning our desire 
for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and 
warlike actions by the U&S& Government in Cuba and Laos. She 
retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might 
well terminate right then and there. Unfortunately she returned later, 
just as I had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the 
room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange 
Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in Russia, 
with Social Realism regaining dominance in the U&S&. This 
gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition 
that we should not presume to lecture her on Abstraction. She 
did not go so far as to say, as was done on other occasions, that 
Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian invention that 
had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the U&S&S&R&

Pozatti and I could not know then that we would experience 
this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere. We were 
to discover, in fact, that quite a number of people share with us the 
impression that, in contrast to other Soviet regions, Moscow's atmosphere 
is depressingly subdued and official. To have one's intentions 
deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste 
of time. Until our Moscow experience, I had not considered it necessary 
to prepare any argument formally or informally. Artists simply do 
not talk to each other in that fashion; and, furthermore, I could 
not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a 
group. To save time, some clarification seemed necessary. The following 
is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists 
in Leningrad:   "We have come to your land with the 
express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your 
ways. Our presence here should also be considered further, sincere evidence 
of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek 
any and all possible ways to effect closer, peaceful ties among all 
people. We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future 
depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between 
individuals.

In spite of the relatively short period of time that we 
have experienced among you, we have already seen many indications of 
your character and spirit. We are acutely aware that yours is a society 
which, in spite of several wars and many privations, has developed 
itself into one of the foremost nations of the world. Your past history 
is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect. Your present history 
is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements.

We have come to you to experience something of your way of life 
while 
also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours. While we, as American 
artists, 
believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual 
activity, we would be less than honest with you, or ourselves, 
if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as 
well as the international community as a whole. In stating this position, 
we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists 
and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect. 
As a matter of fact, we prize the diversity among our own people 
so much that we will not presume to speak for all other American artists. 
But certainly, all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge 
and search for similarities between you and us, but rather the thoughtful 
exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead 
us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding.

Like yourselves, we have pride and love for our country. 
To many of us, this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian 
terror in order to live in dignified freedom. As artists we 
feel the same obligation, as do other individuals, in considering ourselves 
responsible citizens of a great nation.

<The Sane Society> is an ambitious work. Its scope is as 
broad as the question: What does it mean to live in modern society? 
A work so broad, even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed 
by a moral vision, must necessarily "fail". Even a hasty reader 
will easily find in it numerous blind spots, errors of fact and 
argument, important exclusions, areas of ignorance and prejudice, undue 
emphases on trivia, examples of broad positions supported by flimsy 
evidence, and the like. Such books are easy prey for critics. Nor need 
the critic be captious. a careful and orderly man, who values precision 
and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility, might easily be 
put off by such a book. It is a simple matter, for one so disposed, to 
take a work like <The Sane Society> and shred it into odds and 
ends. The thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large 
and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects, some outworn 
and some that were never useful, some once whole and bright but 
now chipped and tarnished, some odd pieces whose history no one remembers, 
here and there a gem, everything fascinating because it suggests 
some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to nothing more 
than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users.

That could be easily done, but there is little reason in it. 
It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush, 
and 
that, after all, is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression 
he has from the outset. I mention these features of the book 
because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must 
be mentioned. It would be superfluous to build a critique around them. 
There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account 
of capitalist civilization.   It is worthwhile to recall that 
Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects. Since 
I have already discussed his moral position, that discussion is 
incorporated by reference into the following pages, which will focus 
on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment. I shall 
first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis, then argue 
that, granted these weaknesses, he still has much left that is valuable, 
and, finally, raise the general question of a philosophical versus 
a sociological approach to the question of alienation.   Almost 
no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation. Despite 
its rather long intellectual history, alienation is still a promising 
hypothesis and not a verified theory. The idea has received much 
attention in philosophy, in literature, and in a few works of general 
social criticism, such as <The Sane Society>. What is missing is 
work that would answer, presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type 
attitude scales, such questions as these: What are the 
components 
of the feeling-state described as alienation? How widespread 
is alienation? What is its incidence among the various classes 
and subgroups of the population? Taking alienation as a dependent variable, 
with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated? 
Considered as an independent variable, how does it affect behavior 
in various sectors of life? Until such work is done, there must 
remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than 
an expression of the malaise of the intellectual, who, rejected by and 
in turn rejecting the larger society, projects his own fear and despair 
onto the broader social screen.   I am not suggesting that 
Fromm ought to do this kind of work. Nor do I think that alienation 
is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual. 
I am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence 
comes in, any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain 
important limitations.   Until such evidence appears, we must 
make do with the evidence we have. Here, perhaps, Fromm is vulnerable, 
for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available, 
and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather 
special ways. Three examples follow.   Fromm's analysis of alienation 
in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the 
bureaucratization of the corporation, the separation of ownership from 
control, and the broad (and thus from the point of view of corporate 
control, ineffective) dispersion of stock ownership. For all these 
points he relies exclusively on Berle and Means's study of 1932, <The 
Modern Corporation and Private Property>. The broad conclusions 
of that pioneering work remain undisturbed, but subsequent research 
has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support, has suggested 
important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference, and 
has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area. 
Fromm seems unaware of these developments.   Another example 
is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys 
designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on 
a broad 
range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three 
times. Moreover, the conclusions he draws from the findings are not 
always the only ones possible. For example, he cites the following 
data from two studies on job satisfaction: in the first study, 85 per 
cent of professionals and executives, 64 per cent of white collar people, 
and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with 
their jobs; in the second study, the percentages were 86 for professionals, 
74 for managerial persons, 42 for commercial employees, 56 for 
skilled workers, and 48 for semi-skilled workers. He concludes that 
these 
data show a "remarkably high" percentage of consciously dissatisfied 
and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers. Starting 
from other value premises than Fromm's, some analysts might conclude 
that the percentages really tell us very little at all, while others 
might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low. Eric Hoffer, 
for example, once said that America was a paradise- the only 
one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small children. 
What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the 
only one possible, it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer 
who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and 
satisfied. Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction 
conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945, in which 
49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as 
he could in a day's work, while 41 per cent said he should not do 
his best but should turn out only the average amount. Fromm says these 
data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread. That 
is one way to read the findings, but again there are other ways. One 
might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary 
associations in the factory, an interpretation which would run counter 
to Fromm's theory of alienation. Or, he might remind Fromm that 
the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all, the 
medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per 
cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's 
trade unions announce pretty much the same view.   In view 
of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of 
survey-type findings on public opinion, and considering the criticisms 
which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical anthropology, 
such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously. "Are people 
happy, are they as satisfied, unconsciously, as they believe themselves 
to be? Considering the nature of man, and the conditions for 
happiness, this can hardly be so".   The ambiguities suggested 
above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought. 
He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways. Sometimes 
he uses it as a subjective, descriptive term, and sometimes as an 
objective, diagnostic one. That is, sometimes it is used to <describe 
felt> human misery, and other times it is postulated to <explain unfelt> 
anxiety and discontent. The failure to keep these two usages 
distinct presents hazards to the reader. It also permits Fromm to do 
some dubious things with empirical findings. When alienation is used 
as an objective and diagnostic category, for example, it becomes clear 
that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far 
toward conquering it. (He in effect does say this in his discussion of 
the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist.) Starting from this, 
and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society, it 
would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would 
be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread, stated 
worker satisfaction, rather than widespread, stated worker dissatisfaction.

The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which 
recognizes unconscious motivations, and which rests on certain ethical 
absolutes, empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition 
the writer is urging at the moment. Thus, in the example cited above 
Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being 
deprived unconsciously, unknowingly, of fulfillment, and then supports 
this with survey data reporting conscious, experienced frustrations. 
He has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are dissatisfied, 
this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are satisfied, 
this shows unconscious alienation. This sort of manipulation is 
especially troublesome in Fromm's work because, although his system 
is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions, he asserts 
that it 
is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and 
from his own consulting room. While the "empirical psychoanalytic" 
label which Fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying 
philosophy, it does increase the marketability of his product.

The final example of the failure to use available evidence, 
though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered, 
comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have 
dealt with the same themes. In a brief chapter dealing with "Various 
Other Diagnoses", he quotes isolated passages from some writers 
whose views seem to corroborate his own, and finds it "most remarkable 
that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held 
by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth **h". He finds 
it equally "remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis 
should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of 
the twentieth century". There is nothing remarkable about this at 
all. It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes. 
There is a difference between evidence and illustration, and Fromm's 
citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category. 
Glance at the list: Burckhardt, Tolstoy, Proudhon, Thoreau, 
London, Marx, Tawney, Mayo, Durkheim, Tannenbaum, Mumford, A& 
R& Heron, Huxley, Schweitzer, and Einstein. This is a delightfully 
motley collection. One can make them say the same thing only by 
not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants 
to hear. The method of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that. Furthermore, 
the list is interesting for its omissions. It omits, for 
example, practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English 
social critics, nearly all the great writers whose basic position 
is religious, and all those who are with more or less accuracy called 
Existentialists. Of course, the list also excludes all writers who are 
fairly "optimistic" about the modern situation; these, almost 
by definition, are spokesmen for an alienated ideology. It is not hard 
to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable 
when you ignore all who hold a different opinion.   Turning from 
these problems of the use of evidence, one meets another type of difficulty 
in Fromm's analysis, which is his loose and ambiguous use 
of certain important terms. One such instance has already been presented: 
his use of alienation. The only other one I shall mention here 
is his use of the term capitalism.   For Fromm, capitalism is 
the enemy, the root of all evil. It is of course useful to have a sovereign 
cause in one's social criticism, for it makes diagnosis and 
prescription much easier than they might otherwise be.

If one characteristic distinguishes <Boris Godunov>, it is 
the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the 
chorus- comes alive in the music. Much of this lifelike quality results 
from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech 
inflections. In this he followed a path that led back to the very 
source of opera; such composers as Monteverdi, Lully and Purcell, 
with the same goal in mind, had developed styles of recitative sensitively 
attuned to their own languages. Through long experimentation 
in his songs, Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different 
from others as the language itself. Giving most of his musical continuity 
to the orchestra, he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence, 
but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words. 
The moments of sung melody, in the usual sense, come most often when 
the character is actually supposed to be singing, as in folk songs and 
liturgical chants. Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies 
for prolonged expressions of emotion- Boris' first monologue, for 
example. Even then, the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that 
the word comes first in importance.   Aside from Boris himself, 
one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among 
the masters of musical portraiture. Even those who appear in only one 
or two scenes are full personalities, defined with economical precision. 
Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action: 
Pimen, Varlaam, Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni. Under no circumstances 
could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has 
an individual touch.   Pimen is an old man, weak in body- his 
voice rarely rises to a full <forte>- but firm and clear of mind. 
His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement. A 
quiet but sturdy theme, somewhat folklike in character, appears whenever 
the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past 
life: @   This theme comes to represent the outer world, the 
realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance, quite distinct 
from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery. It changes and develops 
according to the text; it introduces Pimen when he comes before 
Boris in the last act. Once he has been identified, however, a 
new melody is used to accompany his narrative, a bleak motif with barren 
octaves creating a rather ancient effect: @   An imaginative 
storyteller, Pimen takes on the character he describes, as if he 
were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure. 
Here the composer uses a favorite device of his, the intensification 
of the mood through key relationships. The original ~D minor seems 
to symbolize blindness, inescapable in spite of all attempts to move 
away from it. As the child addresses the shepherd in a dream, light- 
in the form of the major mode- begins to appear, and at the moment 
of the miracle we hear a clear and shining ~D major.   Varlaam 
and Missail always appear together and often sing together, in a straightforward, 
rhythmically 
vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from 
the more subtle and well-educated Pimen. Their begging song might 
easily be a folk melody: @   The same could be said for the 
song to which they make their entrance in the final scene. Apparently 
their origin is humble, their approach to life direct and unsophisticated. 
Whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb 
them now.   Missail is the straight man, not very talkative, 
mild-mannered when he does speak. Varlaam is loud, rowdy, uninhibited 
in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same. A 
rough <ostinato> figure, heard first in the introduction to the inn 
scene, characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into 
the action: @   The Song of Kazan, in which this figure 
becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment, fills in the picture of undisciplined 
high spirits. The phrasing is irregular, and the abrupt key 
changes have a primitive forcefulness. (We can imagine how they startled 
audiences of the 1870's.)   Varlaam's music begins to ramble 
as he feels the effects of the wine, but he pulls himself together 
when the need arises. Both monks respond to the guard's challenge 
with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch 
is Varlaam's labored reading of the warrant. As the knack gradually 
comes back to him, his rhythm becomes steadier, with the rigid monotony 
of an unskilled reader. For the only time in the opera, words 
are <not> set according to their natural inflection; to do so would 
have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene.   Musically and 
dramatically, Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as 
Varlaam. His music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality 
that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach's 
<Hoffman>. His speech shows none of the native accent of the 
Russian characters; in spite of the Italian name, he sounds French. 
His personality appears more striking by contrast with Marina, who 
is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized.

Rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock, a sudden open fifth 
in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it. The effect is as 
if he had materialized out of nowhere. He speaks quietly, concealing 
his authority beneath a smooth humility, just as the shifting harmonies 
that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them. 
He addresses Marina with great deference, calling her "Princess" 
at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme 
that he uses her given name, placing himself by implication in the 
position of a solicitous father.   Curiously, this scene is a close 
parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time, the scene 
between Amonasro and Aida. Rangoni and Amonasro have the same 
purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her 
country's cause- and their tactics are much the same. Rangoni begins 
by describing the sad state of the Church; this brings a reaction 
of distress from Marina. The music becomes ethereal as he calls 
up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she, he tells her, who can 
bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics. As if in a trance, 
she repeats his words- then realizes, with a shock, her own audacity. 
This is no assignment for a frivolous girl, she assures him.

Now Rangoni comes to the point, and we hear, for the first time, 
a long, downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic 
motif of his sinister power. It is a phrase as arresting as a magician's 
gesture, with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness. 
Another theme, sinuously chromatic, appears as he directs her 
to gain power over Grigori by any means, even at the cost of her honor. 
Coming from a priest, the music sounds as odd as the advice: 
@   Marina rebels at this suggestion. Her pride is as much at 
stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty, the princess who 
turns away suitors by the dozen. Indignantly she denounces Rangoni 
for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her.   At once the 
Jesuit pulls out all the stops. To music of a menacing darkness, 
he describes the powers of Satan gaining control of the girl, poisoning 
her soul with pride and destroying her beauty. The combined threat 
of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her, and she falls terrified 
at his feet. With another sudden change of mood, he is again calm and 
protective, exhorting her to trust and obey him as God's spokesman- 
and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction. Whatever 
the source of Rangoni's power, Marina is his captive now; we 
are reminded of this at the end of the next scene, when his theme cuts 
through the warmth of the love duet, again throwing a chill over the 
atmosphere.   The most unusual feature of <Boris>, however, 
is the use of the greatest character of all, the chorus. This is the 
real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not Boris versus Grigori 
or Shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child, but Boris 
versus the Russian people. Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the 
extent to which choral scenes propel the action. Boris' first entrance 
seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the Coronation Scene, 
with its dazzling confusion of tonalities. We have a brief glimpse 
of the Tsar's public personality, the "official Boris", but our 
real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast 
with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene, its bitter 
resentment and fury in the final act.   One reason for the unique 
vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression. It rarely 
speaks as a unit. Even in its most conventional appearance, the guests' 
song of praise to Marina, there are a few female dissenters criticizing 
the princess for her coldness. In many passages- for example, 
the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character 
group with a particular opinion. Hot arguments arise between 
tenors and basses, who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an 
idea.   The opening scene shows this method at its most individual. 
Mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people, those 
who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without 
understanding the causes. They are held in control by force, but 
barely. They will kneel and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely 
intense song, its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath, 
but when the police with their cudgels move away, they mock and 
grumble and fight among themselves. There is a quick change from the 
plaintive song to a conversational tone. "Hey, Mityukh", asks one 
group, "what are we shouting about"? And Mityukh, apparently 
the intellectual leader of the crowd, replies that he has no notion. 
The jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then 
the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before, ending 
it with a wail of despair.   Mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical 
music with considerable dramatic force. In Pimen's cell the 
soft prayers of the monks, heard from offstage, not only help to set 
the scene but emphasize the contrast between young Grigori's thoughts 
and his situation. This is especially striking between Pimen's 
quiet exit and Grigori's vehement outburst against Boris. 
Again, as Boris feels himself nearing death, a procession files into 
the hall singing a hymn, its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch 
to the grim atmosphere: @ The words are hardly calculated 
to put the Tsar's mind at ease. They echo the words with which 
he has described his own vision of the dying child who "trembles and 
begs for mercy- and there is no mercy". The living as well as 
the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal 
one.   One of the outstanding assets of the present production 
is the restoration of the St& Basil's scene, usually omitted 
from performances and rarely included in a published score. Though brief, 
it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy. In addition, 
it is an important link in the plot, giving us a revealing glimpse of 
the people's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri. The mayhem 
in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel.   The St& Basil's 
scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the 
square, the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny. In the 
orchestra we hear first a hushed, hesitant <pizzicato> figure, then 
the insistent "police" motif as it appeared in the opening scene.

The service is over, and a number of people come from the church 
with their spokesman Mityukh in the lead. They bring the news that 
the Pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by 
the hearers, who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk. (Mussorgsky cleverly 
contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment, solemn 
chords or mocking staccatos.) There is still more news, Mityukh 
announces: they have prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich. 
SO FAR THESE remarks, like most criticisms of Hardy, have tacitly 
assumed that his poetry is all of a piece, one solid mass of verse 
expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development. For critics, 
Hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early Hardy 
or late Hardy, or of the London or Max Gate period, but simply 
of Hardy, as of a poetic monolith. This seems odd when one recalls 
that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet: "Domicilium" 
is dated "between 1857 and 1860"; "Seeing the 
Moon Rise" is dated August, 1927. One might expect that in a poetic 
career of seventy-odd years, some changes in style and method would 
have occurred, some development taken place.   This is not, however, 
the case, and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy 
only in a very limited sense. In a time when poetic style, and poetic 
belief as well, seem in a state of continual flux, Hardy stands out 
as a poet of almost perverse consistency. Though he struggled with 
philosophy all his life, he never got much beyond the pessimism of his 
twenties; the "sober opinion" of his letter to Noyes, written 
when Hardy was eighty years old, is essentially that of his first "philosophical" 
notebook entry, made when he was twenty-five: 
"The 
world does not despise us: it only neglects us" (<Early Life,> 
p& 63). And though in his later years he revised his poems many 
times, the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style 
which he had established before he was thirty; so that, while it usually 
is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy, it is difficult to date one.

There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about 
Hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and 
more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his. 
There is only one Hardy style, but in the earlier poems that style 
is only intermittently evident, and when it is not, the style is the 
style of another poet, or of the fashion of the time. In the later poems, 
however, the personal tone predominates. The bad early poems are 
bad Shakespeare or bad Swinburne; the bad late poems are bad 
Hardy.

There are two ways of getting at a poet's development: 
through his dated poems, and through the revisions which he made in later 
editions of his work. About a quarter of Hardy's poems carry 
an appended date line, usually the year of completion, but sometimes inclusive 
years ("1908-1910") or two separate dates when Hardy worked 
on the poem ("1905 and 1926") or an approximate date ("During 
the War"). These dates are virtually the only clues we have to 
the chronology of the poems, since the separate volumes are neither chronological 
within themselves nor in relation to each other. With the 
exception of <Satires of Circumstance,> each volume contains dated 
poems ranging over several decades (<Winter Words> spans sixty-one 
years); the internal organization rarely has any chronological order, 
except in obvious groups like the "Poems of Pilgrimage", the 
"Poems of 1912-13", and the war poems.   From the dated poems 
we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry, 
always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole 
must remain tentative. The dated poems suggest that while Hardy's 
concern with poetry may have been constant, his production was not. 
He had two productive periods, one in the late 1860's, the other 
in the decade from 1910 to 1920 (half of the dated poems are from the 
latter period, and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's 
poems). There was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between 
1872 and 1882 and, except for the poems written on the trip to Italy 
in 1887, very few from 1882 to 1890.   The dated poems also 
give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions 
for his various volumes, and therefore probably are an indication 
of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time. <Poems of the Past 
and the Present> and <Time's Laughingstocks,> both published 
while Hardy was at work on <The Dynasts,> draw heavily on poems 
written before 1900. <Satires of Circumstance> and <Moments of 
Vision,> coming during his most productive decade, are relatively self-contained; 
the former contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that 
is, no poem from a period covered by a previous volume- and the 
latter has only a few such. The last three volumes are again more dependent 
on the past, as Hardy's creative powers declined in his old 
age.   These observations about Hardy's productivity tally with 
the details of his life as we know them. The first productive period 
came when he was considering poetry as a vocation, before he had decided 
to write fiction for a living (in his note for <Who's Who> 
he wrote that he "wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose, 
1868-70; but resumed it later"). During the poetically sterile 
years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was, 
in addition, burdened with bad health (he spent six months in bed in 1881, 
too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at <A Laodicean>). 
Two entries in the <Early Life> support the assumption that 
during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry. 
Mrs& Hardy records that "**h at the end of November [1881] 
he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible" 
(<Early Life,> p& 188); and on Christmas Day, 1890, Hardy 
wrote: "While thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings of 
poesy' before dawn this morning, new horizons seemed to open, and worrying 
pettinesses to disappear" (<Early Life,> p& 302). There 
are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- Hardy 
had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume 
of his fiction- but none in 1891, the year of <Tess>, and only one 
in 1895, the year of <Jude>. After 1895 the number increases, and 
in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no 
dated poem- 1903, when Hardy was at work on <The Dynasts>.

The second productive period, the decade from 1910 to 1920, can 
be related to three events: the completion of <The Dynasts> in 1909, 
which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years; 
the death of Emma Hardy in 1912, which had a profound emotional 
effect on Hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the First 
World War. It may seem strange that a poet should come to full 
fruition in his seventies, but we have it on Hardy's own authority 
that "**h he was a child till he was sixteen, a youth till he was 
five-and-twenty, 
and a young man till he was nearly fifty" (<Early 
Life,> 
p& 42). We may carry this sequence one step further and say 
that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers, wanting only 
the impetus of two tragedies, one personal, the other national, to 
loose those powers in poetry.   Hardy's two productive decades 
were separated by forty years, yet between them he developed only in 
that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing, not an expanding 
process. Like a wise gardener, Hardy pruned away the Shakespearian 
sonnets and songs, and the elements of meter and poetic diction 
to which his personal style was not suited, and let the main stock 
of his talent flourish. The range of the later poetry is considerably 
narrower, but the number of successful poems is far greater.   We 
can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look 
at two poems of very different qualities: "Revulsion" (1866) 
and "Neutral Tones" (1867). There is not much to be said for "Revulsion". 
Like about half of the 1860-70 poems, it is a sonnet 
on a conventional theme- the unhappiness of love. Almost anyone could 
have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent 
statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form, but it 
is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike Hardy. The language 
is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image 
that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality 
to the poem. It is smoother than Hardy usually is, but with the 
smoothness of anonymity. It is obviously a young man's poem, written 
out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion 
without evoking it- that is to say, it is sentimental. There are many 
such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems.

"Neutral Tones" we immediately recognize as a fine poem in 
Hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial 
language, the hard, particular, colorless images, the slightly odd 
stanza-form, the dramatic handling of the occasion, the refusal to 
resolve the issue- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems. 
The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic 
sources of diction, yet it is obviously <not> ordinary speech- 
only Hardy would say "a grin of bitterness swept thereby/Like an 
ominous bird a-wing", or "wrings with wrong", or would describe 
a winter sun as "God-curst".   The details of the setting 
of "Neutral Tones" are not, strictly speaking, metaphorical, but 
they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal 
winter day and to the end of love, and in this way love and weather, the 
emotions and the elements, symbolize each other in a way that is common 
to many of Hardy's best poems ("Weathers", "The Darkling 
Thrush", and "During Wind and Rain", for example) and to 
some moving passages in the novels as well (<Far From the Madding 
Crowd> is full of scenes constructed in this way).   "Neutral 
Tones" is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style, drawn 
from his earliest productive period; I cite it as evidence that he 
did not develop through new styles as he grew older (as Yeats did), 
but that he simply learned to use better what he already had. In the 
poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if 
it is somber, it is also precise, and the precision lends authority to 
the vision. In "Revulsion", on the other hand, the pessimism is 
a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's 
right to speak as he does. In the 1860-70 decade there are 
many poems like "Revulsion", but there is only one "Neutral Tones". 
Hardy was not Hardy very often.   The "Poems of 1912-13" 
offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was manifested 
in the later productive decade. These are the poems Hardy wrote after 
the death of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to what 
might have been, to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness, 
and ended in long years of suffering and hatred. Hardy obviously felt 
that these poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes 
called them "an expiation", and he would not allow them to be published 
in periodicals. They are the only poems that he rearranged as 
a group between their first appearance (in <Satires of Circumstance>) 
and the publication of the <Collected Poems>.   The elegiac 
tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice, and it is not surprising 
that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his. The 
view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic- 
Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable 
pastness of the past, and the eternal deadness of the dead. The 
poems are, the epigraph tells us, the "traces of an ancient flame"; 
the fire of love is dead, and Hardy stands, as the speaker does 
in the last poem of the sequence, over the burnt circle of charred sticks, 
and thinks of past happiness and present grief, honest and uncomforted. 
Critically invisible, modern revolt, like X-rays and radioactivity, 
is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels, 
where 
it is called delinquency.   "Disaffiliation", by the way, 
is the term used by the critic and poet, Lawrence Lipton, who has 
written several articles on this subject, the first of which, in the 
<Nation,> quoted as epigraph, "We disaffiliate **h"- John L& 
Lewis.   Like the pillars of Hercules, like two ruined Titans 
guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles, stand two 
great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of the post-war generation: 
the great saxophonist, Charlie Parker, and Dylan Thomas. If 
the word deliberate means anything, both of them certainly deliberately 
destroyed themselves.   Both of them were overcome by the horror 
of the world in which they found themselves, because at last they 
could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical 
art. Both of them were my friends. Living in San Francisco I saw 
them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted 
by exasperation or fatigue. So as the years passed, I saw them 
each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration.

The last time I saw Bird, at Jimbo's Bob City, he was so 
gone- 
so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he 
realized I was there. "What happened, man"? I said, referring 
to the pretentious "Jazz Concert". "Evil, man, evil", he 
said, and that's all he said for the rest of the night. About dawn 
he got up to blow. The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent 
melody spiraled through it.   The last time I saw Dylan, 
his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality. It 
had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter. Being with 
him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones. 
Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common 
than the same disastrous end. As artists, they were very similar. 
They were both very fluent. But this fluent, enchanting utterance had, 
compared with important artists of the past, relatively little content. 
Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture 
at his own creativity. The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was 
the ambivalence of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation. 
Music, of course, is not so explicit an art, but anybody who knew 
Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own 
gift. Both of them did communicate one central theme: Against the 
ruin of the world, there is only one defense- the creative act. This, 
of course, is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry. It is 
the theme of Horace, who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance 
to Parker or Thomas. The difference is that Horace accepted his theme 
with a kind of silken assurance. To Dylan and Bird it was an agony 
and terror. I do not believe that this is due to anything especially 
frightful about their relationship to their own creativity. I believe 
rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity 
seemed to be the sole value. Horace's column of imperishable 
verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome. Art 
may have been for him the most enduring, orderly, and noble activity 
of man. But the other activities of his life partook of these values. 
They did not actively negate them. Dylan Thomas's verse had to 
find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews. He was 
able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air 
raids and gas ovens. As the world began to take on the guise of an immense 
air raid or gas oven, I believe his art became meaningless to him. 
I think all this could apply to Parker just as well, although, because 
of the nature of music, it is not demonstrable- at least not 
conclusively.   Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme, 
attitude, life pattern. In the practice of their art, there is an 
obvious technical resemblance. Contrary to popular belief, they were 
not great technical innovators. Their effects are only superficially 
startling. Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and 
ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire. Similarly, 
the innovations of bop, and of Parker particularly, have been vastly 
overrated by people unfamiliar with music, especially by that ignoramus, 
the intellectual jitterbug, the jazz aficionado. The tonal novelties 
consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music 
for centuries. And there is less rhythmic difference between progressive 
jazz, no matter how progressive, and Dixieland, than there is 
between two movements of many conventional symphonies.   What Parker 
and his contemporaries- Gillespie, Davis, Monk, Roach (Tristano 
is an anomaly), etc&- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation 
of the older jazz into the basic structure, of which it then became 
an integral part, and with which it then developed. This is true 
of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages 
of almost anybody- Benny Carter, Johnny Hodges. It is true of 
the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously, or at least 
is continuously sprung, so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow 
the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or 
strophe. This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque 
to rococo music. It is the difference between Bach and Mozart.

It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas 
did to poetry. The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith 
Sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern. The metaphysical 
conceits, which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still 
dominant in backwater American colleges, were embroideries. Thomas's 
ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves. The immediate 
theme, if it exists, is incidental, and his main theme- the terror of 
birth- is simply reiterated.   This is one difference between 
Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out. Again, contrary to popular 
belief, there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically 
or emotionally. His sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence 
of all experience. Emotionally it does not resemble Berlioz 
or Wagner; it resembles Mozart. This is true also of a painter 
like Jackson Pollock. He may have been eccentric in his behavior, 
but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles. Partly this difference 
is due to the nature of verbal communication. The insistent talk-aboutiveness 
of the general environment obtrudes into even the most 
idyllic poetry. It is much more a personal difference. Thomas certainly 
wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world. 
Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world.

Technique pure and simple, rendition, is not of major importance, 
but it is interesting that Parker, following Lester Young, was 
one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution. In modern 
jazz, the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional 
embouchure. Metrically, Thomas's verse was extremely conventional, 
as was, incidentally, the verse of that other tragic enrage, Hart 
Crane.   I want to make clear what I consider the one technical 
development in the first wave of significant post-war arts. Ornament 
is confabulation in the interstices of structure. A poem by Dylan 
Thomas, a saxophone solo by Charles Parker, a painting by Jackson 
Pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves. Confabulation 
has come to determine structure. Uninhibited lyricism should 
be distinguished from its exact opposite- the sterile, extraneous 
invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals, or present blight of poetic 
professors.   Just as Hart Crane had little influence on anyone 
except very reactionary writers- like Allen Tate, for instance, 
to whom Valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities 
of an Apollinaire, let alone a Paul Eluard were nonsense- so Dylan 
Thomas's influence has been slight indeed. In fact, his only 
disciple- the only person to imitate his style- was W& S& Graham, 
who seems to have imitated him without much understanding, and 
who has since moved on to other methods. Thomas's principal influence 
lay in the communication of an attitude- that of the now extinct 
British romantic school of the New Apocalypse- Henry Treece, J& 
F& Hendry, and others- all of whom were quite conventional 
poets.   Parker certainly had much more of an influence. At one 
time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school 
band in America to blow like Bird. Even before his death this influence 
had begun to ebb. In fact, the whole generation of the founding 
fathers of bop- Gillespie, Monk, Davis, Blakey, and the 
rest- 
are just now at a considerable discount. The main line of development 
today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them.   The point 
is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays 
are aberrant, idiosyncratic. There is no longer any sense of continuing 
development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to 
Eluard, or for that matter, from Hawthorne through Henry James to 
Gertrude Stein. The cubist generation before World War /1,, and, 
on a lower level, the surrealists of the period between the wars, both 
assumed an accepted universe of discourse, in which, to quote Andre 
Breton, it was possible to make definite advances, exactly as in the 
sciences. I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today. Continuity exits, 
but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester Young, it is 
a continuity sustained by popular demand.   In the plastic arts, 
a very similar situation exists. Surrealists like Hans Arp and Max 
Ernst might talk of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by 
walking on them with painted soles, or by tossing bits of paper up in 
the air. But it is obvious that they were self-deluded. Nothing looks 
anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp. Nothing 
looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion. 
Many of the post-World War /2, abstract expressionists, apostles 
of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard, look alike, and do look 
like accidents. The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random 
may exist, but it is a very impoverished appeal. Once again what has 
happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals, the accidents 
of painting. It is curious that at its best, the work of this 
school of painting- Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, 
Robert Motherwell, Willem de-Kooning, and the rest- resembles 
nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters: 
the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee, 
itself a formula derived from Renoir; the splashes of light and 
black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent. 
Often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure 
utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values. 
You have only to compare such painting with the work of, say, 
Sesshu, to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly.

At its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo 
decorative surface. Its poverty shows up immediately when compared 
with Tiepolo, where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity 
and power. A Tiepolo painting, however confabulated, is a 
universe of tensions in vast depths. A Pollock is an object of art- 
bijouterie- disguised only by its great size. In fact, once the size 
is big enough to cover a whole wall, it turns into nothing more than 
extremely expensive wallpaper. Now there is nothing wrong with complicated 
wallpaper. There is just more to Tiepolo. The great Ashikaga 
brush painters painted wallpapers, too- at least portable ones, 
screens.   A process of elimination which leaves the artist with 
nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest 
in either artist or public for very long. So, in the last couple 
of years, abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion- 
indications of landscape or living figures.

ANGLO-SAXON and Greek epic each provide on two occasions 
a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic 
age. Hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg (lines 
1068-1159), and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in 
a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund (lines 
871-892); Alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery 
of Ares and Aphrodite (<Odyssey> /8,.266-366), and takes up 
a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on (<Odyssey> 
/8,.499-520). Nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike 
the poets of <Deor> and <Widsith>, the poet of <Beowulf> is 
not concerned with his own identity; the poet of the <Odyssey>, 
reputed blind, reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel 
Demodocus. Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing 
is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter, there 
is prima-facie evidence that <Beowulf> and the Homeric poems each 
derive from an oral tradition. That such a tradition lies behind 
the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey>, at least, is hard to deny. Milman 
Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric 
poems are largely formulaic, and was led to postulate that they could 
be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived; 
he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate 
oral composition, and assumed the slightly less likely corollary 
that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas. Proceeding from 
Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata, Francis P& 
Magoun, Jr&, argues that <Beowulf> likewise was created from 
a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive 
generations, and the thesis is striking and compelling. Yet a fresh 
inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: <Beowulf> and 
the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent.

The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a 
very skilful oral poet, but it appears safe to assume that no sustained 
narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty, even 
in a language of many terminal inflections. Assonance seems nearly 
as severe a curb, although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury 
declares that a <Song of Roland> was intoned before the battle 
commenced at Hastings. The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the 
Homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse 
of <Beowulf> or of the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> was not easy 
to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents 
perforce in earning a livelihood. Yet certain aids were valuable 
and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without 
a pause. The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots 
a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame. 
But the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously 
with no apparent effort. Even though the bondage of his verse is not 
so great as the writing poet can manage, it is still great enough for 
him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid 
composition. The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings, which 
provided for the difficulties of alliteration; the Homeric poet 
had epithets, which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter. Either 
poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply 
his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines, because the kennings 
and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous 
synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns. Other synonyms 
could of course serve the same function, and for the sake of ease I 
shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble 
sense, and name, for example, <Gar-Dene> a kenning for the Danes. 
Verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction, 
but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and 
adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents, and to designate the 
members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic 
language. Limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon 
as in the other Germanic dialects, we cannot say how frequently 
the kennings in <Beowulf> recurred in contemporary epic on the same 
soil. But we can say that since a writing poet, with leisure before 
him, would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and 
substantial circumlocution, the kennings like the epithets must reasonably 
be ascribed to an oral tradition.   One of the greatest 
Homerists of our time, Frederick M& Combellack, argues that when 
it is assumed the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> are oral poems, the 
postulated single redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with 
or denied originality in choice of phrasing. Any example of grand 
or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous 
lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his 
completely 
unknown fellow-craftsmen. The quest of the historical Homer 
is likely never to have further success; no individual word in the 
<Iliad> or the <Odyssey> can be credited to any one man; no strikingly 
effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance 
be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus 
that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before 
Christ. This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric 
poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well. To the 
extent that a tale is twice told, its final author must be suspect, although 
plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the 
standard <modus dicendi>.   Combellack argues further, and here 
he makes his main point, that once the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> 
are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to 
formulaic poetry, Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they 
previously found arable. With a few important and a few more unimportant 
exceptions, no expression can be deemed <le mot juste> for its 
context, because each was very probably the only expression that long-established 
practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow. Words 
or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or 
humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable 
time-servers, sometimes accurate and sometimes not. This observation 
too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry. To the extent that 
a language is formulaic, its individual components must be regarded 
as no more distinguished than other cliches.   W& F& Bryan 
suggests that certain kennings in <Beowulf> were selected sometimes 
for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness, but 
such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language 
of <Beowulf> is formulaic. If the master of scops who was most 
responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional, he 
was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd 
and sophisticated misuse of speech elements. Once many significant 
phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for 
prosodic necessity, they are not to be defended for their semantic properties 
in isolated contexts. It is false to be certain of having discovered 
in the language of <Beowulf> such effects as intentional irony.

Yet, if the argument is turned awry, there may be found a 
great deal in Bryan's view, after all. A formulaic element need not 
be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious 
reflection. Time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are, 
they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous. A long evolution 
in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic 
age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things, 
and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually 
accurate. True, we do not know how they were regarded in their 
day, but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive 
to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who 
have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found 
much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases. 
Nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce; 
in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus, 
and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation. 
Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars 
in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable 
ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam. A ship at dry-dock 
could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift 
ship in Greek. Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes would be 
<Gar-Dene> (as their king is Hrothgar) and Priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s. 
Achilles, like Siegfried in the <Nibelungenlied>, 
is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly 
be called swift-footed even when he stands idle. In <Coriolanus> 
the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly, but the 
Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and 
recall to the hearer "a familiar story or situation or a useful or 
pleasant quality of the referent". The epic language was not entirely 
the servant of the poet; it was partly his master. The poet's 
intentions are difficult to discern and, except to biographers, unimportant; 
the language, however, is a proper object of scrutiny, and the 
effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable.

<Beowulf> and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions. Yet 
they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed. 
Albert B& Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated 
to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured 
but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it 
would 
be useless to his guild, and Magoun argues that the <Beowulf> 
poet and Cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion. 
This explanation is attractive, but is vitiated at least in part by 
the observation that Cynewulf, though he used kennings in the traditional 
manner, was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes 
into his works. If Cynewulf was literate, the <Beowulf> poet 
may have been also, and so may the final redactor of the <Iliad> and 
the <Odyssey>. In lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate 
bard, one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry 
recited, and became intimately familiar with the established aids 
to poetizing, and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of 
the compositions of the past. Other theories of origin are compatible 
with the formulaic theory: <Beowulf> may contain a design for 
terror, and the <Iliad> may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering 
to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in 
pottery. The account of the growth and final transcription of these 
epics rests partly, however, upon the degree to which they were formulaic.

Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated 
exactly in the two Homeric poems, and by increasing this figure so 
as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 
2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times. Thus one line in 
five from the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> is to be found somewhere 
else in the two poems. The ratio is thoroughly remarkable, because the 
lines are so long- half again as long as those of <Beowulf>. Anglo-Saxon 
poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition; 
there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines 
and even lengthy passages after the manner of his Homeric colleague. 
In determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle, 
however, to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety, 
for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet 
to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs. 
The closest scrutiny is owed to the Anglo-Saxon kennings and the Homeric 
epithets; if any words or phrases are formulaic, they will be.

The <Iliad> has two words for the shield, |a|s|p|i|s 
and |s|a|k|o|s. 
RECENT CRITICISM OF <Great Expectations> has tended to emphasize 
its symbolic and mythic content, to show, as M& D& Zabel has 
said of Dickens generally, that much of the novel's impact resides 
in its "allegoric insight and moral metaphor". J& H& Miller's 
excellent chapter on <Great Expectations> has lately illustrated 
how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective. 
In his analysis, however, he touches upon but fails to explore an idea, 
generally neglected in discussions of the book, which I believe is 
central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature 
of the narrative. This essay seeks to make that exploration.

Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian 
writers. He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an 
actor's hands are his most useful possession- that in fiction as 
in the theatre, gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing 
character and dramatizing action and response. It is hardly accidental, 
therefore, that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or 
eccentric things with their hands. In <Great Expectations> the hands 
become almost an obsession. Mr& Jaggers habitually bites his 
forefinger, 
a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness 
that half fascinates, half terrifies all who have dealings with him. 
Miss Havisham's withered hands, heavy as if her unhappiness were 
somehow concentrated in them, move in restless self-pity between her 
broken heart and her walking stick. Pumblechook's "signature" 
is the perpetually extended glad hand. Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction 
by regularly rubbing his hands together. Old Mr& Pocket's 
frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless, social-climbing 
wife is to "put his two hands into his disturbed hair" and "make 
an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it", (23) whereas 
Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs& Joe by apologetically 
drawing "the back of his hand across and across his nose". 
(7)   Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark, were it 
not that in <Great Expectations>, as in no other of Dickens' novels, 
hands serve as a <leitmotif> of plot and theme- a kind of unifying 
symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships 
and the values and attitudes that motivate them. Dickens 
not only reveals character through gesture, he makes hands a crucial 
element of the plot, a means of clarifying the structure of the novel 
by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters, 
and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt, pursuit, 
crime, greed, education, materialism, enslavement (by both people 
and institutions), friendship, romantic love, forgiveness, and redemption. 
We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer 
in Thomas Burke's famous story, "The Hands of Mr& Ottermole", 
to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment. 
So it is with <Great Expectations>, whether the hands be 
Orlick's 
as he strikes down Mrs& Gargery or Pip's as he steals a 
pie from her pantry. Such associations suit well with the gothic or 
mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel, but, on a deeper plane, they 
relate to the themes of sin, guilt, and pursuit that have recently 
been analyzed by other critics.   The novel opens with a fugitive 
convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being "laid hands 
on"- (3) a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened 
eyes in the churchyard "as if he were eluding the hands of the dead 
people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist 
upon his ankle and pull him in". (1) Magwitch terrifies Pip into 
stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination 
of a bogy man who may "softly creep **h his way to him and tear 
him open", (1) "imbruing his hands" (2) in him. As Pip agonizes 
over the theft that his own hands have committed, his guilty conscience 
projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost, transforming 
it into "a phantom devoting me to the Hulks". (3) Held 
upside down in the graveyard, Pip clings in terror "with both hands" 
(1) to his convict; later he flees in panic from the family table 
just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the 
front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which 
he has brought to Gargery's forge for mending. Through such details 
Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic 
bond between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter 
both their lives.   Since they commonly translate thoughts and 
feelings into deeds, hands naturally represent action, and since nearly 
half the characters in <Great Expectations> are of the underworld 
or closely allied to it, the linking of hands with crime or violence 
is not to be wondered at. Dickens, for excellent psychological reasons, 
never fully reveals Magwitch's felonious past, but Pip, at the 
convict's climactic reappearance in London, shrinks from clasping 
a hand which he fears "might be stained with blood". (39) Orlick 
slouches about the forge "like Cain" with "his hands in his pockets", 
(15) and when he shouts abuse at Mrs& Joe for objecting 
to his holiday, she claps her hands in a tantrum, beats them "upon her 
bosom and upon her knees", (15) and clenches them in her husband's 
hair. This last "rampage" is only the prelude to the vicious 
blow upon her head, "dealt by some unknown hand" (15) whose identity 
is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action- the tracing 
of Orlick's hammer upon a slate. Pip himself is to feel the 
terror of Orlick's "murderous hand" (53) in his secret rendezvous 
at the sluicehouse on the marshes. Dickens lays great emphasis on 
the hands in this scene. Orlick shakes his hand at Pip, bangs the table 
with his fist, draws his unclenched hand "across his mouth as if 
his mouth watered" for his victim, lets his hands hang "loose and 
heavy at his sides", and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows 
"of the slightest action of his fingers". (53) Orlick might almost 
be Magwitch's bogy man come alive, a figure of nemesis from Pip's 
phantasy of guilt.   The scarred, disfigured wrists of Mr& 
Jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister 
past, for her master, coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests, makes 
a point of the "force of grip there is in these hands". (26) Jaggers' 
iron control over her ("**h she would remove her hands from 
any dish she put before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling 
her back **h".) (26) rests on his having once got her acquitted 
of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to 
conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs 
of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails. 
It is the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's 
("The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting") (48) 
that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and 
establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and 
the genteel cruelty of Satis House. Finally, Magwitch's pursuit 
of Compeyson, his archenemy and betrayer, begins by his holding him 
in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates 
in his "laying his hand on his cloak to identify him", (54) 
thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which 
Compeyson drowns. Magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent 
of justice.   But only in one of its aspects is <Great Expectations> 
a tale of violence, revenge, and retribution. Money, so 
important a theme elsewhere in Dickens, is here central, and hands are 
often associated in some way with the false values- acquisitiveness, 
snobbery, self-interest, hypocrisy, toadyism, irresponsibility, injustice- 
that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth. 
Dickens suggests 
the economic evils of such a society on the first page 
of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers 
"who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal 
struggle", who seemed to have "all been born on their backs 
with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them 
out 
in this state of existence". (1) Pip's great expectations, his 
progress through illusion and disillusionment, turn, somewhat as they 
do for the naive hero of Dreiser's <American Tragedy>, upon 
the 
lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income- what Wemmick calls 
"portable property" and what Jaggers reproaches Pip for letting 
"slip through [his] fingers". (55)   Since a gentleman 
must, if possible, avoid sullying them by work, his hands, as importantly 
as his accent, become the index of social status. Almost the first 
step in the corruption of Pip's values is the unworthy shame he 
feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands: "They 
had never troubled me before, but they troubled me now, as vulgar 
appendages". (8) Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon 
Joe's hands, roughened by work in the smithy, and the deliberate contrast 
between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize 
the opposition of values between which Pip struggles- idleness 
and work, artificiality and naturalness, gentility and commonness, coldness 
and affection- in fact, between Satis House and the forge. 
When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before 
the deeper and stronger force of love, the reunion is marked by an 
embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims "No, don't wipe it 
off- for God's sake, give me your blackened hand"! (35)

Pip's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham, during which he kneels 
to kiss her hand, signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who 
seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour; when, on the 
journey to London that immediately follows, he pauses nostalgically 
to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village, the wooden 
pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence 
and the corruption of worldly vanity. Incidentally, one cannot 
miss the significance of this gesture, for Dickens reintroduces it associatively 
in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis- 
his painful recognition, in a talk with Herbert Pocket, that his 
hopeless attachment to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic. 
In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness 
of contrary magnetisms.   A variety of hand movements helps 
dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond 
the forge. The vulturelike attendance of the Pocket family upon 
Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of Miss Camilla 
Pocket, who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of 
grief-stricken choking, then lays it "upon her heaving bosom" with 
"an unnatural fortitude of manner", (11) and finally kisses it to 
Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward Estella. 
Pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed 
and hypocritical self-aggrandizement. We first see him shaking Mrs& 
Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid 
to her husband for Pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping 
Pip's hands "for the hundredth time at least" ("May I- 
<may> I-"?) (19) in effusive congratulation to Pip on 
his expectations. We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's 
loss of fortune, extending his hand "with a magnificently forgiving 
air" and exhibiting "the same fat five fingers", one of which 
he identifies with "the finger of Providence" and shakes at Pip 
in a canting imputation of the latter's <"ingratitoode"> and 
his own generosity as Pip's <"earliest benefactor">. (58)

Pip first learns "the stupendous power of money" from the 
sycophantic tailor, Mr& Trabb, whose brutality to his boy helper exactly 
matches 
the financial resource of each new customer, and whose fawning 
hands touch "the outside of each elbow" (19) and "rub" 
Pip out of the shop. The respectability which money confers implies 
a different etiquette, and, upon taking up the life of a London gentleman, 
Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that "the spoon is not generally 
used over-hand, but under". 
The following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the 
operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items: 
channel, unit, combined channel and unit, combined arm and file, unit 
record synchronizers, inquiry synchronizers, and alteration switches. 
The declarative operation ~EQU is used to equate symbolic names 
to item numbers (see page 85). _CONTINUATION CARDS_ Certain Autocoder 
statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained 
in the operand (columns 21-75) of a single line on the Autocoder 
coding sheet. When this is the case, the appropriate section of this 
manual will indicate that "Continuation Cards" may be used. Thus, 
when specifically permitted, the operand of a given line on the Autocoder 
coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to 
four additional lines which immediately follow.   The label and 
operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand 
must begin in column 21; i&e&, it must be left-justified in the 
operand column of the coding sheet. The operand need not extend across 
the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation 
cards but may end with the comma following any parameter. Remarks may 
appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they 
are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces.   Illustration 
of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the 
examples illustrating the various statements.   If a continuation 
card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards, 
the compiler will generate a ~NOP and issue an error message. Additional 
restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions 
appear on page 106. 

#RESERVATION OF INDEX WORDS AND 
ELECTRONIC SWITCHES#

The assignment of actual addresses to symbolic 
index word and electronic switch names occurs in Phase /3, of the 
Autocoder processor. The initial availability of index words and electronic 
switches is determined by a table which is included in the Compiler 
Systems Tape. This table originally indicates that index words 
1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for 
assignment to symbolic references; index words 97 through 99 are 
not available. The initial setting of this table may be altered, however, 
as described in the 7070/7074 Data Processing System Bulletin 
"~IBM 7070/7074 Compiler System: Operating Procedure", 
form ~J28-6105.   During the first pass of Phase /3,, references 
to the <actual> addresses of index words and electronic switches 
are collected and the availability table is updated. At the end 
of this pass, the table indicates which index words and electronic switches 
are not available for assignment to symbolic references. 
Both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable 
before the start of assignment in one of the following ways: _1._ 
The initial setting of the availability table indicated that the 
index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment. _2._ 
The one- two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch 
was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify 
indexing or as a parameter which is <always> an index word or electronic 
switch, e&g&, @ _3._ The one- or two-digit number of 
the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an ~EQU 
statement, e&g&, @   When the index words or electronic 
switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements 
described above, the position or order of the statements within the program 
is not important; any such reference will make the index word 
or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass.   During 
the assignment pass of Phase /3,, index words and electronic switches 
are reserved as they are encountered during assignment. Index 
words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways. 
The first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches; 
the third applies only to index words. _1._ During the assignment 
pass, each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic 
name of an index word or electronic switch. When such a reference 
is found, an actual address is assigned and the availability table is 
changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available 
for later assignment. _2._ If the one- or two-digit address of 
an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand 
of an ~XRESERVE or ~SRESERVE statement (see page 
99), the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved. 
_3._ If a statement has been assigned an address in the index word 
area _A._ by means of an actual label or _B._ by means of an 
ORIGIN statement which refers to an <actual address> the 
corresponding index word will be reserved. These entries should normally 
appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each 
~LITORIGIN statement. Otherwise, symbolic names may have 
previously been assigned to these same index words. (This method does 
not apply to electronic switches.)   The preceding methods allow 
efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized 
or multi-phase program, particularly when used in conjunction 
with the ~LITORIGIN statement. Extreme caution should 
be used, however, to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic 
switch which may result from the assignment of more than one 
name or function to the same address.   If the symbolic name or 
actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included 
in the operand of an ~XRELEASE or ~SRELEASE 
statement (see page 101), the specified index word or electronic switch 
will again be made available, regardless of the method by which it 
was reserved. It will not, however, be used for symbolic assignment until 
all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for 
the first time.   If, at any time during the assignment pass, 
the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment, 
the warning message "NO MORE INDEX WORDS AVAILABLE" 
will be placed in the object program listing, the table will be altered 
to show that index words 1 through 96 are available, and the assignment 
will continue as before. If the compiler finds that there are 
no more electronic switches available for assignment, the warning message 
"NO MORE ELECTRONIC SWITCHES AVAILABLE" will be placed in 
the object program listing, the table will be altered to show that electronic 
switches 1 through 30 are available, and assignment will continue 
as before. The resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic 
switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names 
used, e&g&, through the proper use of the ~EQU, ~XRELEASE, 
or ~SRELEASE statements.   As noted in Appendix 
~C, index words 97 through 99 are <never> available for assignment 
to symbolic names by the compiler; also, index words 93 through 
96 may have been made unavailable for assignment. 

#DECLARATIVE 
STATEMENTS#

Autocoder declarative statements provide the processor 
with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations 
properly. Declarative statements are never executed in the object program 
and should be separated from the program instruction area, placed 
preferably at its beginning or end. Otherwise, special care must be 
taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute 
something in a data area as an instruction. If the compiler does 
encounter such statements, a warning message will be issued. 7070/7074 
Autocoder includes the following declarative statements: ~DA 
(Define Area), ~DC (Define Constant), ~DRDW (Define Record 
Definition Word), ~DSW (Define Switch), ~DLINE 
(Define Line), ~EQU (Equate), CODE, ~DTF (Define 
Tape File), ~DIOCS (Define Input/Output Control System), 
and ~DUF (Descriptive Entry for Unit Records). ~DA, ~DC, 
~DTF, and ~DLINE require more than one entry.

The ~DA statement is used to name and define the positions and 
length of fields within an area. The ~DC statement is used to name 
and enter constants into the object program. Since the 7070 and 7074 
make use of record definition words (~RDWS) to read, write, move, 
and otherwise examine blocks of storage, the ~DA and ~DC statements 
provide the option of generating ~RDWS automatically. 
When so instructed, Autocoder will generate one or more ~RDWS 
and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area(s) 
with which they are to be associated. An ~RDW will be of the 
form **f, where ~xxxx is the starting location of the area and ~yyyy 
is its ending location. These addresses are calculated automatically 
by the processor.   In some cases, it may be more advantageous 
to assign locations to ~RDWS associated with ~DA and ~DC 
areas in some other part of storage, i&e&, not immediately preceding 
the ~DA or ~DC areas. The ~DRDW statement may be 
used for this purpose. The ~DRDW statement may also be used to 
generate an ~RDW defining <any> area specified by the programmer.

As many as ten digital switches may be named and provided 
by the ~DSW statement for consideration by the ~SETSW and 
LOGIC macro-instructions. Each switch occupies one digit position 
in a word, can be set ON or OFF, and is considered 
as logically equivalent to an electronic switch. It cannot, however, 
be referred to by electronic switch commands, e&g&, ~ESN, ~BSN, 
etc&. An individual switch or the entire set of switches in 
a word may be tested or altered as desired.   Through use of 
the ~DLINE statement, a means is provided for specifying both 
the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout 
of the area itself. The area may include constant information supplied 
by the programmer. The area may also be provided with additional 
data during the running of the object program by means of ~EDMOV 
or MOVE macro-instructions.   The declarative statement 
~EQU permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual 
index words, electronic switches, arm and file numbers, tape channel 
and unit numbers, alteration switches, etc&, and to equate a symbol 
to another symbol or to an actual address.   The ~DIOCS, 
~DTF, and ~DUF statements are used when required by the Input/Output 
Control System. ~DIOCS is used to select the major 
methods of processing to be used, and to name the index words used 
by ~IOCS. Each tape file must be described by Tape File Specifications, 
produced by ~DTFS. In addition to information related 
to the file and its records, the File Specifications contain subroutine 
locations and the location of tape label information. A ~DUF 
entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type 
of file and the unit record equipment to be used. The ~DUF also 
supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are 
unique to the file.   A full description of the ~DIOCS, 
~DTF, and ~DUF statements is contained in the 7070 Data Processing 
system Bulletin "~IBM 7070 Input/Output Control System", 
form ~J28-6033-1. Brief descriptions of these three declarative 
statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions 
of each of the other 7070/7074 Autocoder declarative statements follow 
below. _~DIOCS- DEFINE INPUT/OUTPUT CONTROL SYSTEM_ When 
the Input/Output Control System is to be used in a program, a 
~DIOCS statement must be used to select the major methods of processing 
to be used. This statement also allows the naming of the index 
words used by ~IOCS. _SOURCE PROGRAM FORMAT_ The basic 
format of the ~DIOCS statement is as follows: @ ANYLABEL 
is any symbolic label; it may be omitted. The entry ~DIOCS 
must be written exactly as shown.   The first item in the 
operand, ~IOCSIXF, is used to specify the first ~IOCS index 
word for programs using tape files. This item may be a symbolic 
name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 
3-94. If the first item in the operand is omitted, the symbolic name 
~IOCSIXF will be assigned. When an actual index word or a 
symbolic address is specified, Autocoder will equate the name ~IOCSIXF 
to it.   The second item in the operand, ~IOCSIXG, 
is used to specify the second ~IOCS index word for programs 
using tape files. This item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit 
or two-digit index word address in the range 3-94. If the second 
item in the operand is omitted, the symbolic name ~IOCSIXG 
will be assigned. When an actual index word or a symbolic address 
is specified, Autocoder will equate ~IOCSIXG to it.

In the midwest, oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment 
of domestic sewage from suburban areas. The high cost of land 
and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have 
created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational 
characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat 
more organic matter per unit volume.   Research at Fayette, Missouri 
on oxidation ponds has shown that the ~BOD in the treated 
effluent varied from 30 to 53 ~mg/~l with loadings from 8 to 
120 ~lb ~BOD/day/acre. Since experience indicates that effluents 
from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these ~BOD 
concentrations, the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated 
treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds. 
Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine 
aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen 
transfer. Their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 
to 4 ~lb of oxygen/~hr/~hp.   O'Connor and Eckenfelder 
discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes. 
They indicated that a 4-day retention, aerated lagoon would give 60 
to 76 per cent ~BOD reduction. Later, Eckenfelder increased 
the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer 
months. It appeared from the limited information available that the 
aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity 
of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree 
of treatment in a smaller volume. 

#RED BRIDGE SUBDIVISION#

With 
the development of the Red Bridge Subdivision south of Kansas City, 
Missouri, the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate 
sewage disposal. The sewage system from Kansas City was not 
expected to serve the Red Bridge area for several years. This necessitated 
the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with 
an expected life from 5 to 15 ~yr. For the initial development an 
oxidation pond was constructed as shown in Figure 1. The oxidation pond 
has a surface area of 4.77 acres and a depth of 4 ~ft. The pond 
is currently serving 1,230 persons or 260 persons per acre. In the summer 
of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted 
obnoxious odors. It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the 
pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased 
and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae.

The anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond 
necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen 
than by sodium nitrate. At the same time further expansion in the 
Red Bridge Subdivision required the construction of additional sewage 
treatment facilities. The large land areas required for oxidation 
ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer. 
It was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the 
problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary 
treatment for the additional development. 

#PILOT LAGOON#

The lack 
of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer 
to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility 
for treating domestic sewage. The pilot plant was a circular lagoon 
81 ~ft in ~diam at the surface and 65 ~ft in ~diam at the bottom, 
4 ~ft below the surface, with a volume of 121,000 ~gal. The 
side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to 
prevent erosion. The pilot lagoon was located as shown in Figure 1 
to serve the area just south of the existing housing area. The major 
contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system 
as the subdivision developed. The pilot lagoon was designed to handle 
the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period. Initially, 
the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the 
domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period. This 
operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant, with a slowly 
increasing load, over a reasonable period of time.   The pilot 
plant was equipped with a 3-~hp turbine aerator (Figure 2). The 
aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range 
of speeds. The sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and 
continuously recorded on 24-~hr charts. The raw sewage was introduced 
directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the 
raw sewage with the aeration tank contents. The effluent was collected 
through two pipes and discharged to the Blue River through a surface 
drainage ditch. 

#ANALYSES#

Composite samples were collected at 
weekly intervals. The long retention period and the complete mixing 
concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent. 
Weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible 
than daily samples. The composite samples were normally collected 
over a 6-~hr period, but an occasional 24-~hr composite was made. 
Examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation 
of the 6-~hr composite samples with 24-~hr operations. The 
data indicated that the organic load during the 6-~hr composites was 
essentially 50 per cent of the 24-~hr organic load.   Grab samples 
were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its 
operating conditions. Efforts were made to take the grab samples at 
random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6-~hr 
composite sample. A single 24-~hr composite sample indicated that the 
sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical. 

#PILOT PLANT 
OPERATIONS#

The ~BOD of the influent to the pilot plant varied 
between 110 and 710 ~mg/~l with an average of 350 ~mg/~l. 
This was equivalent to 240 ~mg/~l~BOD on a 24-~hr basis. The 
~BOD of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a 
subdivision. 
The ~BOD in the effluent averaged 58 ~mg/~l, a 76-per 
cent reduction over the 24-~hr period. Examination of the data 
in Table /1, shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent 
~BOD. The periods of high effluent ~BOD occurred during 
cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted. 
Ice caused the aerator to overload, straining the drive belts. The 
slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce 
oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage.   The 
organic loading on the unit averaged 32 ~lb of ~BOD/day or about 
2 ~lb ~BOD/day/1,000 ~cu ~ft aeration capacity. Needless 
to say, the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis, but was 
270 ~lb ~BOD/day/acre on a surface loading basis. It seems that 
the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly 
loaded activated sludge system.   The flow rate remained relatively 
constant during the winter months as shown in Table /1,. With 
the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open 
sewers. As construction progresses, the volume of storm drainage will 
be sharply reduced. The retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged 
from 9.8 to 2.6 days, averaging 6.4 days.   The large amount 
of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center 
created a suspended solids problem. The vegetables were not readily metabolized 
by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on 
the surface. A skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of 
most of these light solids. The average volatile suspended solids in 
the effluent was 75 ~mg/~l while ~MLSS averaged 170 ~mg/~l 
volatile suspended solids. The average sludge age based on displacement 
of solids was calculated to be 14.5 days. The oxygen uptake rate 
in the mixed liquor averaged 0.8 ~mg/~l/~hr during the first 
four months of this study. Variations in aerator speeds during the latter 
two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen 
demand. The increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1.2 to 2.6 ~mg/~l/~hr 
which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to 
be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower 
rotor speeds. It appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids 
were active microbial solids with the heavier, less active solids 
settling out.   The suspended solids discharged in the effluent 
were found to be the major source of the ~BOD. Removal of the suspended 
solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing 
only 20 ~mg/~l ~BOD. The ~BOD in the drainage ditch 
receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 ~mg/~l. This low ~BOD 
was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation 
since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during 
this study. 

#MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION#

Routine microscopic examinations 
were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by McKinney and 
Gram for the various types of protozoa. It was found that the 
aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation 
pond. At no time were algae found in the mixed liquor. The bacteria 
formed typical activated sludge floc. The floc particles were all small 
as the heavier floc settled out.   Initially, the flagellated 
protozoa predominated, but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated 
protozoa. As the temperature decreased, the number of free swimming 
ciliated protozoa decreased. Very little protozoa activity existed 
below 40`~F. When the temperature reached 32`~F all protozoan 
activity ceased; but as the temperature rose, the numbers of 
protozoa increased rapidly. Only once were stalked ciliates found in 
the mixed liquor. The predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa 
is indicative of a high bacterial population. 

#OXYGEN TRANSFER# 

One of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen 
transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator. Routine determinations 
were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen 
uptake rates. The data given in Table /2, show the routine operation 
of the aerator. The dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently 
high until January 29, 1961. An extended cold spell caused 
ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform 
and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water. The added 
resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen 
transfer capacity. It was approximately one month before the belt 
problem was noticed and corrected, but at no time was there a deficiency 
of dissolved oxygen.   A series of eight special tests were 
conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer 
rate. Five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to 
simulate an ice cover. The rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0-~mg/~l 
dissolved oxygen concentration and 10`~C for various rotor speeds 
is given in Table /3,. The maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1.0 
~mg/~l dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 ~lb/day at a maximum 
rate of 9.3 ~mg/~l/~hr. The actual power requirements indicated 
2~lb oxygen transfer/~hr/~hp. The polyethylene cover reduced 
the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent, indicating that the maximum 
oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface. 

#OXIDATION 
POND#

During this study septic conditions developed in the 
oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted. Shortly after this 
study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of 
sodium nitrate. The location of the oxidation pond in a high-value 
residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer. 
The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 
160 to 270 ~mg/~l of ~BOD with an average of 230 ~mg/~l. 
The ~BOD data are given in Table /4,. A single 24-~hr composite 
sample had a ~BOD of 260 ~mg/~l, indicating a typical 
domestic sewage. The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 
147,000 ~gpd, giving a retention period of 42 days. The organic 
loading on the pond was slightly under 60~lb~BOD/day/acre.

The effluent ~BOD averaged 34 ~mg/~l, a little lower 
than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60~lb 
~BOD/day/acre. The ~BOD of the effluent ranged from a 
minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47~mg/~l. Microscopic examination of 
the effluent showed that minimum ~BOD occurred when the algae began 
to decrease with cold weather. When the algae began to build up 
again, the effluent ~BOD rose. During the two weeks when the algae 
disappeared from the effluent ~BOD's in the effluent were 18 
and 16 ~mg/~l.

Thus, the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations 
are defense of shipping, defense of naval forces, and area defense. 
The last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and 
near terminals and bases.   To effect these operations, five elements 
exist (1) surface, (2) air, (3) mines, (4) submarine, and (5) 
fixed installations. Surface forces have been used to provide defense 
zones around naval and merchant ship formations, air to furnish area 
surveillance, and mines for protection of limited areas. Submarines and 
shore installations are new elements. The submarine now has a definite 
place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to 
ocean areas. Fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection. 
Mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets.

A sixth element, not always considered, is intelligence. It includes 
operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment. 
Operational intelligence presumably will be available from our 
national intelligence agencies; intelligence on the environment will 
come from the recently augmented program in oceanography. The major 
postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be 
considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting. 

#NECESSITY FOR AN OVER-ALL CONCEPT#

Thinking on submarine defense 
has not always been clear-cut. Proponents of single elements tend 
to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified, 
and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents 
has assumed the greatest importance. Consequently, air, surface, 
and submarine elements overshadow the mine, fixed installations, 
and intelligence. These have sought more and more of what they have. 
Each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others. 
This, despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are 
necessarily mutually supporting. Thus, the most productive areas are 
not necessarily the most stressed. This is stated to emphasize the necessity 
for an over-all concept of submarine defense, one which would 
provide positions of relative importance to ~ASW elements based on 
projected potentialities. Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements 
can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common 
objective. An over-all concept would have other advantages. It would 
allow presentation to the public of a unified approach. Now the problem 
is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily. While one 
element 
is announcing progress, another is delineating its problems. The 
result can only be confusion in the public mind. A unified concept 
can serve as a guide to budgeting and, if public support is gained, will 
command Congressional support. Industry's main criticism of the 
Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any 
one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how. Lacking guidance, 
industry picks its own areas. The result, coupled with the salesmanship 
for which American industry is famous, is considerable expenditure 
of funds and efforts in marginal areas. An over-all concept 
will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield 
greatest dividends. Therefore, a broad concept of over-all submarine 
defense is needed for co-ordination of the Navy's efforts, for a logical 
presentation to the public, for industry's guidance, and as a 
basis for a program to the Congress. 

#PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN AN OVER-ALL 
CONCEPT#

That which follows will be a discussion of principles 
and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare. 
Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world, divided 
between her various fleets. Some are also in Albania and others 
are on loan to Egypt. Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly 
become Communist can furnish bases. Communist target areas can 
be assumed, but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide 
with Soviet intentions. Attack can come from almost any direction against 
many locations. Logically, then, the first principle of the plan 
must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area.

It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while 
building, at bases, in transit, and on station. Destruction of the enemy's 
building and base complex, however, requires attacks on enemy 
territory, which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities. In 
transit or on station, it may not be possible to attack the submarines 
until commission of an overt act. The Communists are adept at utilizing 
hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is 
to their advantage. Therefore the second principle of the plan must be 
that, while providing for all-out hostilities, its effectiveness is 
not dependent on general war.   Antisubmarine warfare does not involve 
clashes between large opposing forces, with the decision a result 
of a single battle. It is a war of attrition, of single actions, 
of an exchange of losses. This exchange must result in our ending up 
with some effective units. Initially, having fewer units of some elements- 
especially submarines- than the opponent, our capabilities need 
to be sufficiently greater than theirs, so that the exchange will 
be in our favor. Therefore, the third principle of the plan must be that 
it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types, 
unless at an assured favorable exchange rate.   The submarine 
has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since 
World War /2,. Its speed has increased, it operates at increasingly 
greater depths, its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited, and 
it will become even more silent. The next developments will probably 
be in weaponry. The missile can gradually be expected to replace the 
torpedo. As detection ranges increase, weapons will be developed to 
attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges. Therefore, 
the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously 
increasing capabilities in the opponent.   No element can accomplish 
the total objective of submarine defense. Some elements support 
the others, 
but all have limitations. Some limitations of one element 
can be compensated for by a capability of another. Elements used 
in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum 
of the capabilities of the individual elements. Therefore, the plan's 
fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of 
all elements in combination.   Conceivably the submarine defense 
problem can be solved by sufficient forces. Numbers would be astronomical 
and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution. 
Shipbuilding, aircraft procurement, and weapon programs indicate that 
there will not be enough of anything. Therefore, any measures taken 
in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute 
greatly to success when hostilities occur. Therefore, the sixth 
principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures 
which will reduce future force requirements.   The world is constantly 
changing; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today. The 
seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough 
to allow for technological breakthroughs, scientific progress, and 
changes in world conditions. 

#SUPPORTING ELEMENTS IN ~ASW OPERATIONS# 

To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense 
has been demonstrated, the mission has been stated, broad principles 
delineating its content laid down, and the supporting elements listed. 
Before considering these elements in more detail, an additional 
requirement should be stated. Large area coverage will accomplish all 
other tasks. Therefore, because reduction in tasks results in reduction 
of forces required, the plan should provide for expanding area coverage. 
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented 
geographically. Consequently, the system giving area coverage (if such 
coverage is less than world wide) must be flexible and hence at least 
partially mobile. Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote, 
the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements: 
air, surface, sub-surface, fixed installations, mines, and intelligence. 
These are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness 
of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order 
in the hope that the true order of importance will result. ##

<Intelligence>, 
as used herein, will include information on possible 
opponents and on the environment which can affect operations. These can 
be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence. 
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress. Good operational 
intelligence can ensure sound planning, greatly reduce force 
requirements, 
and increase tactical effectiveness. Environmental intelligence 
is just as important. The ocean presently co-operates with the 
target. Full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the 
environment to our side, resulting in an increase in effectiveness of 
equipment and tactics, a decrease in enemy capabilities, and the development 
of methods of capitalizing on the environment. Therefore, improved 
intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and, as 
it supports all other elements, rates a top priority. Gathering intelligence 
is important, but of equal importance is its translation into 
usable form.   A program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic 
research into tactical and operating instructions. Approaching 
this problem on a statistical basis is invalid, because the opponent 
has the same sources available and will be encountered not under 
average conditions, but under the conditions most advantageous to him. 
Therefore, the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating 
instructions based on measurement of conditions, in the area, at the time 
of encounter. All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage 
then. Temperature, wind, oxygen content, depth, bottom character, and 
animal life are the chief environmental variables. There may be others. 
Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature, 
because more of the variables would be encompassed. These variations 
must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically. 
Progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging, but little 
guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information. 
A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on 
the spot. ##

<Mine warfare> has in the past been directed against 
surface targets. By its nature it has always been of great psychological 
advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater 
counter-efforts. Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine 
targets. They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters, 
however, and targets must come within a few yards of them. Mines 
need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment, 
extended to deep water, and have their effective area per unit 
increased. Mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they 
are difficult to counter, cost little to maintain until required, and 
can be put into place quickly. A most attractive feature is that detection 
and attack are combined in a single package. Effective employment 
will reduce force requirements.   For example, effective mine 
barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from 
Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense, 
inshore patrol, convoy escort, shipping control, and mine defense for 
the entire Gulf of Mexico. More extended systems, covering all passage 
into the Caribbean, would free the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico 
from the previously listed requirements. Systems covering the Gulf 
of St& Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United 
States are not impossible. Such mine defense systems could permit concentration 
of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase 
in the probability of success. The advantages inherent in mine warfare 
justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any 
of the other elements. ##

<Fixed installations> are increasingly 
advocated as the problem of area defense emerges. The proponents 
are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence 
on their military counterparts. Systems which detect submarines over 
wide areas are attractive, although they can be only "burglar alarms". 
Mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets, 
since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target. Such systems 
are expensive and are oriented geographically. In an over-all 
~ASW concept, dependence on and effort expended for such systems 
should be limited to those with proven capabilities. No general installation 
should be made until a model installation has been proved and 
its maximum capability determined. In addition, proposals for fixed installations 
should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile 
system. For fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that 
should be inherent in naval systems. ##

<The submarine> has become 
increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system. It operates 
in its target's environment, and any advantage gained therefrom 
by the target is shared by the attacker. But the submarine is a weapon 
of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed. 
Two metabolites (/1, and /2,) of ~p-aminobenzoic acid (~PABA) 
which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast 
bacteria are biosynthesized from ~PABA. The 7 carbons of ~PABA 
are incorporated directly into metabolite /2, (as shown with 
both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled **f). Thirty-five of the 36 
carbon atoms arise from ~PABA. All 28 carbons of metabolite /1, 
(a product of mild acid hydrolysis of /2,) arise from ~PABA. 
Metabolite /1, isolated from the medium, however, showed a lower specific 
activity, which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite.

Vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite /1, destroyed the 
biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines. 
Fragment ~A has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt 
and free base. Preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the 
molecule (metabolite /1,) is cleaved at a secondary amide bond. (N& 
H& Sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation 
of K&G& Untch.) _STUDIES ON ESTERASES_- Research 
on esterases in mammalian sera was continued. One of the most interesting 
findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to 
rare earth ions. The inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations 
of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect 
of rare earth salts. Various metal ions have been found to protect plasma 
arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine. The effects 
can be related to the structure of this -~SH enzyme. The non-identity 
of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established. 
Furthermore, the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian 
sera, and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin (or a factor attached 
to it) in addition to arylesterase. Selective inhibitors can 
distinguish the two activities. Investigations on the acceleration of 
human plasma cholinesterase were carried further. (E& G& Erdo^s, 
L& E& Boggs, C& D& Mackey) _BIOPHYSICAL STUDIES ON 
MODIFIED FIBROUS PROTEINS_- Electron-microscopical and physical-chemical 
methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured 
collagen and ribonucleic acid. (R& V& Rice)   A method 
was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen 
(~EWC). It was observed that ~EWC macromolecules are the 
same diameter (15~A) but much longer (up to several microns) than 
vertebrate tropocollagen. This unusual collagen also was shown to undergo 
a reversible thermal phase transformation. (R& V& Rice, M& 
D& Maser) _STUDIES ON PEPTIDES AND PEPTIDASES_- This investigation 
involved several aspects. Substance ~Z, an active urinary 
peptide, was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated 
column chromatography; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography 
were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological 
effects <in vitro> on isolated surviving organs and <in vivo> 
on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment required for registering 
respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles 
under various conditions was developed by the Instruments Section 
(Victor Jackman, W& C& Barnes, J& F& Reiss); and enzymes 
which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps 
Substance ~Z were studied. Experiments are in progress to develop 
ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes 
and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions. (E& G& Erdo^s, 
C& D& Mackey, A& G& Renfrew, W& B& Severs, 
E& M& Sloane) _SEED PROTEINS_- In a physiochemical study 
of seed proteins, the globulins of the Brazil nut have been investigated. 
In addition to the known principal globulin, excelsin, three 
other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed. A 
water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight (ca& 10,000) has 
also been found in this system and partly characterized. (E& F& 
Casassa, H& J& Notarius) 

#CONTINUUM MECHANICS AND VISCOELASTICITY# 

_THEORY OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUIDS_- On the basis of 
a differentiability assumption in function space, it is possible to prove 
that, for materials having the property that the stress is given by 
a functional of the history of the deformation gradients, the classical 
theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation 
has been infinitesimal for all times in the past. By strengthening 
the differentiability assumption, it has been possible to derive second 
and higher order theories of viscoelasticity. In the second-order 
theory, one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the 
first-order stress relaxation function. (B& D& Coleman with 
Walter Noll, Department of Mathematics, Carnegie Institute of Technology) 
_VISCOELASTIC MEASUREMENTS_- An extensive series of 
measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum 
instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation, free vibration, and 
creep measurements over the temperature range of **f to 80`C&. 
As many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally. 
The simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous 
systems did not hold here. It was possible, however, to decompose 
the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two 
viscoelastic mechanisms, each compatible with the Boltzmann superposition 
principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence 
factors. (Hershel Markovitz, D&J& Plazek, Haruo Nakayasu) 

#GEOCHEMISTRY#

_TRACE ELEMENTS IN TEKTITES, METEORITES, AND RELATED 
MATERIALS_- The results of microanalysis of tektites (natural 
glasses of unknown origin) for gallium and germanium have shown that 
these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial (or less likely 
from lunar) matter by impact of a celestial body. The gallium/germanium 
ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary 
matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components 
of the tektite. Gallium oxide is less volatile than silica (the 
main constituent of tektites) and germanium oxide is more volatile. Australites 
(tektites from Australia) give the appearance of a second 
melting. In conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium 
content was found in the portion (flange) that has undergone a second 
melting. The silicate fractions of stony meteorites show gallium/germanium 
ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone 
melting at some point in their histories.   Libyan Desert silica-glass, 
another natural glass, is composed of nearly pure silica 
and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area. The gallium 
content, however, has been enhanced five-fold. This glass is probably 
formed from Libyan Desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite 
impact.   Nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy 
to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may nevertheless melt only 
small quantities of material. Most of the impact energy is spent 
in crushing and fragmentation. When rapid quenching follows melting, 
<impact glasses> may result. These always contain metallic inclusions. 
Impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been 
produced by stony meteorites or comets. No meteorites have ever been 
recovered from paleoexplosion craters, and recent craters containing 
impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception 
of Aouelloul crater, Adrar, Western Sahara Desert. This 
crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic 
material has been recovered. (A& J& Cohen, John Anania) 

#INORGANIC CHEMISTRY#

Preparation of a coordination compound is often 
accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a 
ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol. By applying this general 
principle, a great number of complex compounds of osmium, ruthenium, 
iridium, and rhenium, with triphenylphosphine, triphenylarsine, 
and triphenylstibine 
have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few 
years. (Lauri Vaska, E& M& Sloane, J& W& DiLuzio) 
In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, decomposition of 
solvent alcohol <and> coordination of its fragments to the metal were 
not considered, following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in 
preparative coordination chemistry. Recent work with radiocarbon and 
deuterated alcohols as solvents, however, has given evidence that metal-hydrido 
and -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction 
with alcohol in some of these systems. Some of the previously reported 
compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and 
carbonyl compounds discovered, the more representative examples being 
**f, **f, **f, **f and **f (**f).   The coordination complexes 
formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and 
arsines are being investigated (R& G& Hayter). Particular interest 
is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal 
halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes. During the 
past year, these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes 
of nickel (/2,) and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged 
complexes of palladium (/2,) (see figure), as well as new compounds 
of the well-known type **f. The structures, properties, and reactions 
of these compounds are being studied.   In another study 
chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species, prepared 
homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis, are being characterized 
and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view 
to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed 
under varying preparative conditions. (J& A& Laswick, N& L& 
Heatwole) 

#STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MACROMOLECULES#

_ELASTICITY 
OF MACROMOLECULAR NETWORKS_- The theory of elasticity of 
Gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the 
equations of state relating variables of pressure, volume, temperature, 
stress and strain have been precisely formulated. Simple elongation 
has been treated in detail. The various stress-temperature coefficients 
for constancy of volume and strain, constancy of pressure and strain, 
and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated. The 
dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy 
of compressibility have been related to the elongation. In continuation 
of these theoretical studies, a more precise elucidation of 
the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought. (P& J& 
Flory, C& A& J& Hoeve) _CHAIN CONFORMATIONS OF POLYMERIC 
CHAINS_- Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions 
of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been extended to include 
more general types of chains. The mean-square end-to-end distance 
of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement 
with values deduced from viscosity data. These studies are being 
extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the 
hindrances to rotation around chain bonds. (C& A& J& Hoeve, 
A& A& Blumberg) _CRYSTALLIZATION IN POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS_- 
The crystallization of copolymers comprising **f units interspersed 
with a minor percentage of **f is limited by the inability of the 
crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky 
side group of the latter. Only uninterrupted sequences of the former 
are eligible for formation of crystallites. Limitations on the lengths 
of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short 
crystallites which can be formed, and this is reflected in a broadening 
of the melting range. (Robert Chiang, J& B& Jackson, P& 
J& Flory) Carefully executed melting studies on this system (M& 
J& Richardson) permit quantitative estimation of the instability 
engendered by reduced crystallite length. The complex morphology of 
polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor. 
Hence, the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations 
in the latter field. _CONTRACTION OF MUSCLE_- Glycerinated 
muscle, in the presence of the physiological agent. (~ATP) responsible 
for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins 
of muscle, has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive 
both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of 
alcohols and water. Experiments carried out over long periods of time 
in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the 
onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of 
several degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of only several 
per cent. The contraction therefore partakes of the character of 
a phase transition. While ~ATP appears to be necessary for the 
occurrence of contraction, its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it 
by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction. 
(C& A& J& Hoeve, P& J& Flory) _ANIONIC POLYMERIZATION_- 
One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques 
is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight 
distribution. A simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse 
polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed. 
The preparation of such products is not new, but the systems heretofore 
employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental 
skill and starting materials of a high purity. In the new process 
impurities present in the solvent (benzene), the monomer, and in the 
reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers, 
are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of 
initiator, a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium, at 
a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth. Upon completion 
of the purging step, additional initiator appropriate for the molecular 
weight of the sample desired is added, and the system is then warmed 
to the polymerization temperature, at which the reaction is allowed 
to go to completion. The predictability of the molecular weights was 
found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared, with **f ratios less 
than 1.1.   Contrary to observations with ethers, no apparent 
change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable 
periods of time in benzene as solvent. 
_ORGANIZATION:_ In this publication measurements of interfacial 
angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances. 
T& V& Barker, who developed the classification-angle system, 
was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he 
died in 1931. The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested 
crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University 
Museum at Oxford. Since 1948 the working headquarters has 
been the 
Department of Geology and Mineralogy. Numerous cooperating individuals 
in Great Britain, Holland, the United States, and Belgium 
have contributed editorially or by making calculations. Great interest 
and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee. 
Financial and material help have come from academic, governmental, and 
industrial organizations in England and Holland. Editors for Volumes 
/1, and /2, were M& W& Porter and the late R& C& 
Spiller, both of Oxford University. A third volume remains to be 
published. _SUBSTANCES:_ Volume /1, deals with 2991 compounds 
belonging to the tetragonal, hexagonal and trigonal, and orthorhombic 
systems; and Volume /2,, with about 3500 monoclinic substances. 
Volume /3,, in preparation, will treat the anorthic compounds described 
in Groth's CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE. _PROPERTIES:_ 
The Barker system is based on the use of the smallest number of 
interfacial angles necessary for indexing purposes. Other morphological, 
physical, and optical property values are also given. _SOURCES 
OF DATA:_ The index is essentially a new treatment of previously 
compiled morphological data. Most of the data used are from Groth's 
CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE. _CRITICALITY:_ Every calculation 
has been made independently by two workers and checked by one of 
the editors. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ 
Accepted crystallographic symbolism has been used; other 
symbols related to the index necessarily have been introduced. _CURRENCY:_ 
This publication covers the old literature (Groth); there 
is no mechanism for keeping the volumes up to date. _FORMAT:_ 
The publication form is that of clothbound books. The data are presented 
in lists and tables. Part 1 in both volumes is labeled "Introduction 
and Tables". The tables include those for the classification 
angles, refractive indices, and melting points of the various types 
of crystals. Part 2 of Volume /1, and Parts 2 and 3 of Volume 
/2, contain the crystal descriptions. These are grouped into sections 
according to the crystal system, and within each section compounds 
are arranged in the same order as in Groth's CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE. 
An alphabetical list of chemical and mineralogical names 
with reference numbers enables one to find a particular crystal description. 
References to the data sources are given in the crystal descriptions. 
_PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION:_ The BARKER INDEX 
is published for the Barker Index Committee by W& Heffer + Sons, 
Ltd&, 3-4 Petty Cury, Cambridge, England. Volume /1, containing 
Parts 1 and 2 was published in 1951; Volume /2,, in three 
parts, in 1956. The two volumes are available from the publisher 
for $16.80 and $28.00, respectively. #/2,-2. CRYSTAL DATA#

_ORGANIZATION:_ 
The present edition of CRYSTAL DATA was written 
by J&D&H& Donnay, the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 
Md& (Part /2,) and Werner Nowacki, University of Berne, 
Switzerland (Part /1,) with the collaboration of Gabrielle Donnay, 
U& S& Geological Survey, Washington, D& C&. Many collaborators 
in the United States and Switzerland helped in collecting 
and assembling data, in making calculations, and in editing. Support 
came from academic and industrial groups in these two countries. The 
Geological Society of America gave a grant-in-aid to complete the 
work and bore the expenses of publication. Preparation of a second 
edition is in progress under the sponsorship of the Crystal Data Committee 
of the American Crystallographic Association. Coeditors are 
J&D&H& Donnay, G& E& Cox of Leeds University, and 
Olga Kennard of the National Council for Medical Research, London. 
Financial grants have been received from the National Science 
Foundation and the (British) Institute of Physics for the compilation 
work and the publication costs. The continuity of the project is 
suggested by plans for an eventual third edition. _SUBSTANCES:_ 
Elements, alloys, inorganic and organic compounds. (Metal data will 
not be included in the second edition, since these have been collected 
independently by W& B& Pearson, National Research Council, 
Ottawa, and published as A HANDBOOK OF LATTICE SPACINGS AND STRUCTURES 
OF METALS AND ALLOYS by Pergamon Press.) _PROPERTIES:_ 
Crystallographic data resulting mainly from ~X-ray and electron 
diffraction measurements are presented. Cell dimensions, number of formula 
units per cell, space group, and specific gravity are given for 
all substances. For some substances, auxiliary properties such as the 
melting point are given. _SOURCES OF DATA:_ Part /1, of the 
present edition covers the literature to mid-1948; Part /2,, up 
to the end of 1951. Much of the material comes directly from secondary 
sources such as STRUKTURBERICHT. _CRITICALITY:_ The vast 
number of compounds to be covered, the limited resources to do the job, 
and the immediate need for this type of compilation precluded a thorough 
evaluation of all available data in the present edition. Future 
editions may be more critical. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, 
PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ Since Parts /1, and /2, were prepared 
independently, the abbreviation schemes and the chemical symbols used 
differ in the two parts. The second edition should have greater uniformity. 
_CURRENCY:_ A second edition is in preparation, and there 
are long range plans for a third. _FORMAT:_ Data in the present 
edition are presented in tables and lists. Part /1, deals with 
the classification of crystalline substances by space groups and is 
not a numerical data compilation. The compounds are divided according 
to composition into seven categories. Part /2, contains determinative 
tables for the identification of crystalline substances. These are 
arranged according to crystal system. There are formula and name indexes 
covering both parts. References for Part /1, are given at the 
end and for Part /2, in the tables. _PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION:_ 
The present edition of CRYSTAL DATA (**f), published in 
1954 as Memoir 60 of the Geological Society of America, is now out 
of print. The manuscript of the second edition will probably be ready 
by the end of 1960. #/2,-3. CRYSTAL STRUCTURES#

_ORGANIZATION:_ 
The author of CRYSTAL STRUCTURES is Ralph W&G& 
Wyckoff, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. The first section 
of this publication appeared in 1948 and the last supplement in 1960. 
Though now complete, the publication is included in this directory 
because of its importance and because of the long-term nature of its 
preparation. _SUBSTANCES:_ Elements, inorganic and organic compounds 
(no alloys). _PROPERTIES:_ The data presented are derived 
almost entirely from ~X-ray diffraction measurements and include 
atomic coordinates, cell dimensions, and atomic and ionic radii. _SOURCES 
OF DATA:_ Published literature. _CRITICALITY:_ The 
aim was to state the results of <all> available determinations of atomic 
positions in crystals. Presumably the tabulated data are best available 
values. The critical comments in the textual sections of this 
publication are invaluable. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, 
PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ The terminology used conforms to that of INTERNATIONALE 
TABELLEN ZUR BESTIMMUNG VON KRISTALLSTRUKTUREN. _CURRENCY:_ 
During the years of publication, supplement and replacement 
sheets were issued periodically. Coverage of the literature extends 
through 1954 and includes some 1955 references. It is to be hoped 
that some way will be found to keep this important work current. _FORMAT:_ 
The publication form is that of loose-leaf sheets (**f) 
contained in binders. The book is divided into chapters and in each chapter 
the material is grouped into Text, Tables, Illustrations, and 
Bibliography. Each group is paginated separately; numbers sometimes 
followed by letters are used so that insertions can be made. Inorganic 
structures are found in Chapters /2,-/12,, organic structures 
in Chapters /13,-/15,. Within each chapter an effort has been 
made to group together those crystals with similar structures. There 
are three indexes, i&e&, an inorganic formula index, a mineralogical 
name index, and a name index to organic compounds. _PUBLICATION 
AND DISTRIBUTION:_ Publisher of CRYSTAL STRUCTURES is Interscience 
Publishers, 250 Fifth Avenue, New York 1, N& Y&. The 
work consists of four sections and 5 supplements. Price of the complete 
work including all necessary binders is $148.50. #/2,-4. DANA'S 
SYSTEM OF MINERALOGY#

_ORGANIZATION:_ Six editions of 
James Dwight Dana's SYSTEM appeared between 1837 and 1892. 
In 1915 Edward S& Dana, editor of the sixth edition, asked W& 
E& Ford of Yale University to prepare a seventh edition of his 
father's work. A number of people became involved in the preparation 
but work was slow until 1937. In that year a grant was obtained from 
the Penrose Fund of the Geological Society of America to finance 
additional full-time workers. Money was also advanced by the publishers, 
John Wiley + Sons, Inc&. Volume /1, was completed in 1941 
and published in 1944. The editors of this volume and Volume /2, 
were the late Charles Palache, Clifford Frondel, and the late Harry 
Berman, all of Harvard University. Work on Volume /2, was 
begun in 1941, interrupted by the war in 1942, and resumed in 1945. The 
volume was completed in 1950 and published in 1951. A supplementary 
grant from the Geological Society of America helped finance its 
publication. Besides the editors there were many contributors in the 
United States and Great Britain to Volumes /1, and /2,. W& 
E& Ford, for example, continued to supply data on the occurrence 
of minerals until his death in 1939. Volume /3, is nearing completion 
and there are plans to revise Volume /1,. The project is currently 
supported by Harvard University. _SUBSTANCES:_ Minerals. 
_PROPERTIES:_ Crystallographic, physical, optical, and chemical 
properties. The crystallographic data given include interaxial angles 
and unit cell dimensions; the physical property values include hardness, 
melting point, and specific gravity. _SOURCES OF DATA:_ Almost 
entirely original articles in journals; abstracts and other compilations 
on rare occasions when original papers are not available. 
_CRITICALITY:_ All information is carefully appraised and uncertain 
facts are designated by (?). An authentic diffraction pattern 
is always obtained and optical properties are frequently checked. _USE 
OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ Recommendations 
of international authorities, such as the International Union 
of Crystallography, are followed. There is a complete synonymy at 
the beginning of each species description. _CURRENCY:_ Currency 
in the usual sense cannot be maintained in an undertaking of this sort. 
_FORMAT:_ The data are presented in text and tables in bound 
volumes. Volume /1, of the seventh edition contains an introduction 
and data for eight classes of minerals; Volume /2, contains data 
for forty-two classes. References are given at the end of each mineral 
description and a general index is given at the end of each volume. 
There will be a comprehensive index in Volume /3, covering all 
three volumes. _PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION:_ Volume /1, (**f) 
of the seventh edition of DANA'S SYSTEM OF MINERALOGY was published 
in 1944 and Volume /2, (**f) in 1951 by John Wiley + Sons, 
Inc&, New York, N& Y&. (The association of Wiley + Sons 
with the Dana Mineralogies dates back to 1844 when they published 
the second edition of the SYSTEM.) The two volumes are available 
from the publisher for $14.00 and $16.00, respectively. #/2,-5. 
THE GROTH INSTITUTE#

_ORGANIZATION:_ "The Groth Institute", 
which was established in 1958, is a group activity affiliated 
with the Physics Department of The Pennsylvania State University, 
University Park, Pa&. Ray Pepinsky is the Director. The Institute 
derives its name from Paul von Groth's CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE, 
a five-volume work which appeared between 1906 and 1919. 
The resident staff is large and consists of professional assistants, 
graduate students, abstractors, librarian, technical editor, machine 
operators, secretarial help, and others. There are also corresponding 
members and outside advisory groups. The Air Force Office of Scientific 
Research has provided financial assistance in the early stages 
of the Institute's program. _SUBSTANCES:_ All crystalline 
substances and other solid-state materials. _PROPERTIES:_ The 
aim is to collect a very broad range of physical, chemical, morphological, 
and structural data for crystals on an encyclopedic scale and to 
seek all possible useful and revealing correlations of properties with 
internal structure. _SOURCES OF DATA:_ The first stage of operation 
has centered on the literature imaging of critical or summarizing 
tabulations such as the Barker Index. Coverage of primary literature 
will follow. Unpublished data will be available to the Groth institute 
from cooperating groups and individuals. _CRITICALITY:_ 
Critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this 
project. However, the proposed correlation of the many interrelated 
properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data 
and suggest areas for reinvestigation. In addition, the availability 
of computers will permit recalculation and refinement of much structural 
information. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL 
CONSTANTS:_ For punched-card or tape storage of information all 
literature values must be conformed to a common language. In this 
way a degree of unification of nomenclature, symbols, and units will be 
realized. 
BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES OF foods differ in their requirements 
for preservation, a number of methods have been developed over the years 
involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration, 
fermentation, salting, chemical treatment, canning, refrigeration, and 
freezing. The basic objectives in each instance are to make available 
supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter, 
to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and 
insects, and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of 
harvest or production to areas of consumption.   In earlier years, 
the preservation of food was essentially related to survival. In 
the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations, food-preservation 
techniques have sought also to bring variety, peak freshness, 
and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the 
comsumer.   With the development of nuclear technology, isotopic 
materials, and machine radiation sources in recent years, the possibilities 
of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted 
the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout 
the world. An early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate 
answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled. 
Interest remained, however, in the possibility that it would serve 
as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses 
and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing, or 
without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations. 

#FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPOILAGE OF FOODS#

The chief 
factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are (1) microorganisms 
such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts, (2) enzymes, (3) insects, 
(4) sprouting, and (5) chemical reactions. Microorganisms are often 
responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods. Of special concern is 
the growth of bacteria such as <Clostridium botulinum> which generate 
poisonous products. Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes 
which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability. 
Spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group 
of components in the food with others or with its environment, as in 
corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with 
oxygen in the air to produce rancidity.   Sprouting is a naturally 
occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes, onions, carrots, beets, 
and similar root vegetables. Insect infestation is a problem of importance 
chiefly in stored grain. The presence of parasitic organisms 
such as <Trichinella spiralis> in pork introduces another factor which 
must be dealt with in food processing.   To permit the storage 
of food for long periods of time, a method of preservation must accomplish 
the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic 
action. The term "sterilization" applies to methods involving essentially 
complete destruction of all microorganisms. Food treated in 
this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging 
and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without 
refrigeration. The process of "pasteurization" involves milder 
and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction 
of most, but not all, of the microorganisms. Less severe thermal 
treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes. 

#GENERAL 
EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION#

Ionizing radiation can cause 
the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage 
or, at lower doses, can inhibit their action. It furnishes a means 
of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic 
organisms present in meats. Deactivation of enzymes is also 
possible, although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 ~Mrad 
or more. Because of undesirable flavors, odors, colors, and generally 
low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude, 
the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation 
by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching.

Radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food. It will, 
however, inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables.

The radiation doses required for the preservation of foods 
are in the following ranges: _1._ For radiosterilization, to destroy 
all organisms for long-term preservation- about 4.5 ~Mrad for 
nonacid foods of low salt content. _2._ For radiopasteurization, 
to partially destroy microorganisms; results vary with types of food, 
storage conditions, and objectives of treatment- commonly of the 
order of 0.2 ~Mrads but up to about 0.8 ~Mrads. _3._ For 
destruction of insects- about 25,000 ~rads. _4._ For inhibiting 
the sprouting of root vegetables- 4,000 to 10,000 ~rads. 
Preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side 
effects, particularly at the higher radiation dosages. In this respect, 
the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized 
foods has, to date, been found to be low in comparison with 
fresh and commercially processed foods. A number of foods are quite 
acceptable as regards taste and palatability, however, at dosages substantially 
less than sterilization levels. Moreover, the nutritive value 
of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little, if any, change, although 
some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization 
doses. 

#RADIATION SOURCES#

For irradiation of food, the results 
obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation, 
and X-ray, gamma, and high-energy electron radiation are suitable. 
Aside from availability and economic considerations, each has certain 
practical advantages; for example, gamma rays give deeper penetration 
but cannot be focused or collimated, whereas unidirectional electron 
beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the 
food package to be irradiated. Selection of a source for commercial irradiation 
would involve consideration of numerous factors including required 
dose rate, load factor, throughput, convenience, safety, and most 
important, costs.   Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing 
radiations, gamma sources, cobalt-60, cesium-137, fission products, 
or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium 
salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems. 
Of the various particle accelerators, the Van de Graff machines, resonant 
transformers, and linear accelerators are the principal ones available 
for commercial use.   Costs of the effective energy produced 
by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation 
processes. Estimated production costs of radiation energy 
from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per ~kwhr. Conventional 
energy for processing foods is available in the range of 
at most a few cents per ~kwhr for electric power and the equivalent 
of a few mills per ~kwhr for process steam. Radiation, therefore, is 
at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as 
much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization 
or radiosterilization. What are the possibilities of lowered radiation 
production costs for the future? It has been estimated that for 
applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood 
of 10 cents per ~kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for 
gamma radiation generated in a reactor core. No comparable reductions 
in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen. Such projections, however, 
appear highly 
speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond 
those foreseen for food-preservation facilities.   Because agricultural 
activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest 
of many foods are widely scattered geographically, and because of 
the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance 
to a central processing location, the use of large central processing 
stations, where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt 
range might be utilized, is inherently impracticable. 

#PRESENT STATUS 
OF IRRADIATION PRESERVATION OF FOODS#

The objective of complete 
sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product 
capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods 
of time. Chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military 
services. For them, providing appetizing food under battle or emergency 
conditions is a paramount consideration. They require completely 
sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration, preferably 
items already cooked and ready to eat. High nutritional value, variety, 
palatability, and appetizing appearance are important for reasons 
of morale. Foods for rear stations, which require cooking, but no refrigeration, 
are also of interest. Of primary interest are meats.

Radiopasteurization, which produces fewer adverse sensory changes 
in food products, has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping 
qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items. Thus, food so processed 
might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more 
produce at peak freshness and palatability. Commercial interest is chiefly 
in this type of treatment, as is military interest under peacetime 
conditions.   The present status of food preservation by ionizing 
radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs. 
_MEATS_ The radiation processing of meat has received extensive 
investigation. To date, the one meat showing favorable results at 
sterilization doses is pork. Of particular interest to the military 
services is the demonstration that roast pork, after radiosterilization, 
is superior in palatability to available canned pork products. Tests 
with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development 
of off-flavors. A prime objective of the Army Quartermaster Corps 
program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means 
of overcoming it, since it is a major and desirable dietary item. Partly 
because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes 
before radiosterilization, treated fresh meats have the appearance of 
boiled or canned meat.   Off-flavor is a less severe problem with 
the radiopasteurization of meats, but problems of commercial acceptability 
remain. Moderate radiation doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 ~rads 
can extend the shelf life (at 35 ~F) of fresh beef from 5 days 
to 5 or 6 weeks. However, the problem of consumer acceptability remains. 
The preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef 
and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts. Cooked beef irradiated in 
the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color.   When lamb 
and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses, the meat becomes 
dehydrated, the fat become chalky, and, again, unnatural changes in 
color occur.   Ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger 
have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration, and radiopasteurization 
might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping 
qualities. However, a major problem here is one of scale of processing; 
ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local 
level, whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require 
central processing and distribution facilities. The problems of 
color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are 
the same as for solid cuts.   Specialty cooked items containing 
meat portions, as in "frozen dinners" might offer a potential use 
for radiopasteurization. The principal potential advantage would be 
that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost 
under refrigeration instead of being frozen. A refrigerated item 
could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen 
foods of the same type.   Competitive processes for preserving 
meats are by canning and freezing. Costs of canning meat are in the 
range of 0.8 to 5 cents per pound; costs of freezing are in the area 
of 2 to 3.5 cents per pound. The table on page 10 shows costs of canning 
and freezing meat, and estimated costs for irradiation under certain 
assumed conditions. Under the conditions of comparison, it will 
be noted that: _(1)_ Radiosterilization (at 3 ~Mrad) is more 
expensive than canning, particularly for the cesium-137 source. _(2)_ 
Radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137 
source is in the range of freezing costs. _(3)_ Irradiation 
using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator. 
_POULTRY_ Results of irradiation tests with poultry have 
been quite successful. At sterilizing doses, good palatability results, 
with a minimum of changes in appearance, taste, and odor. Radiopasteurization 
has also been successful, and the shelf life of chicken 
can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared 
with about 10 days for the untreated product. Acceptable taste and 
odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken. Acceptance 
of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed, however, for two 
reasons: (1) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration 
is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation 
and distributing practices, and (2) treatment by antibiotics, a measure 
already approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, 
serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 
cent per pound. _SEAFOOD_ Fresh seafood products are extremely 
perishable. Although refrigeration has served to extend the storage 
life of these products, substantially increased consumption might be possible 
if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately. 
Furthermore, it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms 
possible.   The instrument is shown in Fig& 1 and consists 
essentially of a hard, sharp, tungsten carbide knife which is pushed 
along the substrate to remove the coating. The force required to accomplish 
removal is plotted, by means of an electronic recorder, against 
distance of removal. Since the removal force is a function of coating 
thickness, a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into 
the instrument to accurately measure film thickness. This, too, is 
recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously 
cut. A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer 
to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited 
on such substrates as iron and other metals, glass, wood, and 
plastic surfaces. The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily 
be carried out.   Hesiometer results have been found to compare 
excellently with manual knife scratching tests. The instrumental 
method, however, is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical 
results which can be accurately repeated at wil over a period of time. 
If a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from 
a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant 
rake angle, a number of removal mechanisms are often observed 
which depend upon the thickness of the coating. At low thicknesses a 
cutting (or shearing) phenomenon is often encountered. As the coating 
becomes thicker, the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of 
failure. If the coating becomes still thicker, a peeling type failure 
finally can occur. The typical appearance of these various mechanisms 
is illustrated in Figs& 2, 3, and 4, which are single frame enlargements 
of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal 
process. It can be seen from Fig& 2 that the cutting removal 
of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the 
coating. The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are 
obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and 
failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife 
and extending to the coating surface.   The pictures of Figs& 
3 and 
4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating 
is detached by failure in a region at, or close to, the interface between 
coating and substrate.   If the force required to remove the 
coatings is plotted against film thickness, a graph as illustrated schematically 
in Fig& 5 may characteristically result. Here, ~<H> 
is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the 
substrate and ~<t> is the film thickness. It can be seen that 
the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly 
from cutting to cracking to peeling removal. Also, it can be readily 
seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state 
response, while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature.

It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the 
same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of 
changes in coatings thickness. Presumably the interfacial bond strength 
and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case. What then, 
are the factors that contribute to these phenomena? Why should 
the "practical adhesion" of a coating as assessed by a knife method 
change, initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise 
to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing 
thickness? 

#CUTTING MECHANISM OF COHESIVE FAILURE#

The 
cutting (or shearing) removal process has been previously described. 
It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely 
by cohesive failure. The details of the removal process are shown 
schematically in Fig& 6. The various forces result from the reaction 
of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along 
the shear plane, which makes an angle ~|f with the substrate. The 
action and reaction forces are ~<R> and **f, respectively and 
are equal and opposite in direction. All the other force vectors are 
derived from these. **f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness 
~<t> from the substrate. **f is the shear force along the shear 
plane; **f and **f are the thrust forces acting against coating 
and knife, respectively; **f is the normal compressive force acting 
on the shear plane; **f is the friction force between chip and knife 
surfaces, and ~<P> is the normal force acting on the face of the 
knife. ~|a is the rake angle of the knife; ~|f is the angle 
the shear plane makes with the substrate; ~|t is the friction 
angle; and ~|b is the angle the resultants make with the plane of 
the substrate.   An analysis of the vector relationships shows 
that the rake angle ~|a and the friction angle ~|t determine 
the vector direction **f of the force resultants ~<R> and **f. Consequently, 
both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction 
occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the 
knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting 
removal process.   It is difficult to measure the direction 
and magnitude of ~<R> directly. In actual practice, the values most 
readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force **f and the 
shear angle ~|f. These two values and the rake angle ~|a are 
sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships. 
~|a is defined by the geometry of the knife; ~|f can readily 
be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after 
cutting from the substrate; **f is instrumentally determined. From 
Fig& 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be 
derived and the cutting force is **f where ~|l is the shear strength 
of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material, ~<w> 
is the width of the removed coating and ~<t> is its thickness.

If the cutting force, **f is plotted against film thickness, 
a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope 
**f. However, in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental 
methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects 
occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured 
value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn& (1). 

#BLUNT KNIFE#

One of these is the fact that the knife employed, no 
matter how well sharpened, will have a slightly rounded cutting edge. 
This signifies that ~|a, the rake angle, is no longer a constant 
to zero film thickness. The curvature of this bluntness is, in the 
case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer, determined by 
the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals 
cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 
mil&.   The force vector concept of Fig& 6 can readily be 
applied to this condition also. Because the rake angle **f at the tip 
of the knife is very much smaller (or even negative) when compared 
to the value of ~|a for the major portion of the knife, a very rapid 
increase in cutting force with thickness will result. This reduces 
to the relationship: **f where **f is the intercept at zero thickness 
of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn& (1), **f is the 
thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife 
tip, **f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness, and 
the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn& (1). It can be 
seen that **f is a constant, and is determined for the most part by the 
geometry of the knife. The blunter the knife, the higher is the value 
of **f. The importance of a hard, abrasion resistant knife material 
like the Carboloy employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes 
apparent. Softer knives would blunt very rapidly, making the value of 
**f inexact. In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even 
change during the course of a measurement. 

#KNIFE FRICTION#

A second 
factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally 
determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused 
by the bottom of the knife against the substrate. This is not a constant 
value like **f, but varies with the thickness of the coating and the 
direction and magnitude of the resultants ~<R> and **f of Fig& 
6. Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust 
**f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or 
lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of **f. 
The resultant friction force, **f is thus directly proportional to 
**f and consequently also to film thickness.   The value of **f 
can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted 
on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track 
under various external loadings. A straight line relationship is usually 
observed in a plot of **f against load ~<L>, having slope ~<k>, 
and **f Since the load ~<L>, under actual cutting conditions 
is caused by **f, it can be seen that **f   The measured force, 
~<H>, in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently 
can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the 
coating, **f that due to the bluntness of the knife, **f, and that due 
to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate, **f, 
or **f The first two forces are directly interrelated and depend 
upon film thickness, whereas **f is independent of these two and is a 
constant for a given knife/coating combination.   These theoretical 
relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig& 7 and their 
sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made 
with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig& 5 
for the cutting mechanism. 

#CHIPPING MECHANISM OF COHESIVE FAILURE# 

Although a large number of coatings systems, 
particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism, 
frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place. 
This is a chipping, dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle 
coatings resins or very highly pigmented films. This is shown in 
the photomicrograph of Fig& 8.   The basic difference between 
the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism 
is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously 
without fracture, rupture intermittently occurs along the 
shear plane. The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been 
studied extensively by MERCHANT for metal cutting, and the principles 
found can be directly applied to coatings.   By studying 
high speed movies made of this type of failure, the sequence of relationships 
as schematically illustrated in Fig& 9 could be observed.

In the first picture (9~a) the knife is just beginning to advance 
into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip 
formation. In the next, the shear plane angle is high, and extends to 
the inclined work surface. With increasing advance of the knife into 
the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear 
angle rapidly decreases. Eventually, rupture occurs along the shear 
plane (9~e), and the cycle repeats itself.   MERCHANT 
has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry 
and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be 
applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values 
of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional 
area are used. Consequently, if the shear angle ~|f 
is replaced by the rupture angle **f, the relationships as described in 
eqns& (1), (2), (4), and (6) will directly apply. 

#THE CRACKING 
MECHANISM#

Under equilibrium cutting conditions, the chip exerts a 
force **f against the coating and an equal opposite force **f against 
the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig& 6. If the 
rake angle ~|a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle 
~|t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low 
enough to give a positive value for **f, the resultant vector ~<R> 
will lie above the plane of the substrate.

Within only a few years, foamed plastics materials have managed 
to grow into an integral, and important, phase of the plastics industry- 
and the end is still not yet in sight. Urethane foam, as only 
one example, was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955. 
Yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb& and expectations 
are for a market of 275 million lb& by 1964. Many of the other 
foamed plastics, particularly the styrenes, show similar growth potential. 
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be 
evaluated. As this issue goes to press, for example, one manufacturer 
has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength; 
another reports that a cellular polypropylene, primarily for use 
in wire coating applications, is being investigated.   On the 
following pages, each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described 
in detail, as to properties, applications, and methods of processing.

It might be well to point out, however, some of the newer 
developments that have taken place within the past few months which 
might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved. 
In urethane foams, for example, there has been a definite trend 
toward the polyether-type materials (which are now available in two-component 
rigid foam systems) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot 
molding. Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating 
fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that 
are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets. Urethane 
foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention. 
In one outstanding example, Whirlpool Corp& found that by switching 
to urethane foam insulation, they could increase the storage capacity 
of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models. 
Much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing 
the urethane foams, including spraying, frothing, and molding (see 
article, p& 391 for details). And in meeting the demands for urethane 
foam as a garment interlining, new adhesives and new methods of laminating 
foam to a substrate have been developed.   New techniques 
for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost 
that particular material into a number of new consumer applications, including 
picnic chests, beverage coolers, flower pots, and flotation-type 
swimming toys. Two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable 
styrene's growth during the year were packaging (molded inserts 
replacing complicated cardboard units) and foamed-core building panels. 
Extruded expandable styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive 
price-wise with paper- also showed much potential, particularly 
for packaging. Sandwich panels for building utility shelters that 
consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused 
interest in the construction field.   In vinyl foam, the big news 
was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material 
(for details, see P& 395). Better "hand", a more luxurious 
feel, and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result. 
Several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for 
extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that 
would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end 
product to any great extent.   Readers interested in additional 
information on foams are referred to the Foamed Plastics Chart appearing 
in the Technical Data section and to the list of references which 
appears below. 

#URETHANE FOAMS#

@ Since the mid 1950s, when 
urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market, growth 
has been little short of fantastic. Present estimates are that production 
topped the 100-million-lb& mark in 1960 (85 to 90 million 
lb& for flexible, 10 or 11 million lb& for rigid); by 1965, production 
may range from 200 to 350 million lb& for flexible and from 115 
to 150 million lb& for rigid. The markets that have started to open 
up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations. 
Furniture upholstery, as just one example, can easily take millions 
of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation 
by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for garment 
interlining is only now getting off the ground, with volume potential 
in the offing. _BASIC CHEMISTRY_ Urethane foams are, basically, 
reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates (usually 
tolylene diisocyanate). Blowing can be either one of two types- 
carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate 
or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid 
such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon.   The most important factor 
in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally 
the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production. 
Originally, the main types used were various compositions of polyesters. 
These are still in wide use today, particularly in semi-rigid 
formulations, for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural 
panels, foamed-in-place insulation, automotive safety padding, arm 
rests, etc&. More recently, polyethers- again in varied compositions, 
molecular weights, and branching- have come into use at first 
for the flexible foams, just lately for the rigids. The polyether glycols 
are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which 
is much desired in cushioning.   Although the first polyether foams 
on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method, 
today, thanks to new catalysts, they can be produced by a one-shot 
technique. It is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded 
on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours 
and with superior properties to latex foam.   The polyester urethane 
foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether 
group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol 
or polypropylene glycol modified with a triol. _ONE SHOT VS& 
PREPOLYMER_ In the prepolymer system, the isocyanate and resin are 
mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs. The foaming can be accomplished 
at some future time at a different location by the addition of the 
correct proportion of catalyst in solution. In one-shot, the isocyanate, 
polyester or polyether resin, catalyst, and other additives are 
mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately. Basically, this means 
that simpler processing equipment (the mixture has good flowing characteristics) 
and less external heat (the foaming reaction is exothermic 
and develops internal heat) are required in one-shot foaming, although, 
at the same time, the problems of controlling the conditions of 
one-shot foaming are critical ones. _PROPERTIES_ Most commercial 
uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lb&/cu& 
ft& for rigid foams, between 1 and 3 lb&/cu& ft& for flexible 
foams. This latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average 
of 5.5 lb&/cu& ft& in commercial grades. _COMPRESSION STRENGTH:_ 
Graph in Fig& 1, p& 392, indicates how the ratio of 
compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or 
decreased. The single curve line represents a specific formulation in 
a test example. By varying the formula, this curve may be moved forward 
or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression 
strength/density ratio. _THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE:_ 
In flexible urethane foams, we are referring to the range 
between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials' 
primary performance remains functionally useful. In temperature 
resistance, this quality is usually related to specific properties, 
e&g&, flexural, tensile strengths, etc&. Thermal conductivity is 
directly traceable to the material's porous, air-cell construction 
which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which 
forms its composition. These air or gas bubbles make highly functional 
thermal barriers. The ~K factor, a term used to denote the rate 
of heat transmission through a material (B&t&u&/sq& ft& 
of material/hr&/`F&/in& of thickness) ranges from 0.24 to 0.28 
for flexible urethane foams and from 0.12 to 0.16 for rigid urethane 
foams, depending upon the formulation, density, cell size, and nature 
of blowing agents used. Table /1,, p& 394, shows a comparison of 
~K factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials 
in common use, including two different types of rigid urethane foam. _FLEXURAL 
STRENGTH:_ This term refers to the ability of a material 
to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required 
to cause failure by bending. The higher-density urethane semi-rigid 
foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance, i&e&, the 
12 lb&/cu& ft& foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 
3 lb&/cu& ft& density. Note that flexural strength is not always 
improved by simply increasing the density, nor is the change always 
proportional from one formulation to another. Where flexural strength 
is an important factor, be sure that your urethane foam processor is 
aware of it. _TENSILE STRENGTH:_ This property refers to the greatest 
longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing 
apart. Like compression strength of urethane foams, it has a direct 
relationship to formulation. Exceptional tensile strength is another 
of urethane foam's strong features. Figure 2, above, shows the 
aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change 
in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet light. _PROCESSING 
URETHANES_ There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane 
product. The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape, it 
can be molded, it can be poured-in-place, it can be applied by spray 
guns, etc&.   Slab stock is still one of the most important forms 
of urethane end-product in use today. Basically, the foam machines 
that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units, a variable 
mixer, a nozzle carriage assembly, and, in many cases, a conveyor 
belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process 
and until it solidifies into foam. The ingredients are fed from tanks 
through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate. The mixing 
head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle. 
It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed 
and after a short cure, the material can be cut into lengths as desired.

Much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate 
the slab stock into finished products. Profile cutting machines 
are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce 
sine, triangle, trapezoid, and other profiles in variable heights, 
dimensions, etc&. The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain 
certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically. Also 
available is a slitter which "peels" the inside of a folded block 
of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd& in 
length, down to 1/16 in& thick.   The low cost and ease of fabrication 
of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide 
variety of shapes, dimensions, and contours that can be tailor-made to 
customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case 
liners, materials handling containers, packaging and cushioning devices, 
and such novelties as soap dishes, toys, head rests, arch supports, 
and gas pedal covers. _MOLDING_ Although slab stock appeared 
first, it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with 
irregular shapes, crowned contours, or rounded edges, the cutting of 
slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process. Only by resorting 
to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily 
in the established cushion market.   The closed molding 
of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction 
of the material (molding in open molds was more feasible). 
Satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether 
foams were never fully achieved. Closed molding generally resulted 
in parts weighing more (because of higher density) than parts fabricated 
from free-blown foams. This counteracted the gain from having no scrap 
loss. In addition, there were difficulties with the flow and spreading 
of the foam mixture over the mold surface, trouble with lack of 
gel strength in the rising foam, and problems of splits. The introduction 
of one-shot polyether foam systems, aided by the development of 
new catalysts, helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding. 
While there are still many bugs to be ironed out, the technique 
is fast developing. _OTHER TECHNIQUES_ Simple systems are available 
that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured, pumped, 
etc&, into a void where they foam up to fill the void. In a 
typical application- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels- 
an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more 
than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top 
of the panel is locked in place by a jig. 
Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`F& 
(29-32`C&). The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs&. Sixty 
lbs& loading is possible but 40 lbs& is adequate.   The suds 
box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain 
pipe (thus returning suds to soap box) and the machine is started. 
The 160-ml& bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is 
applied slowly and directly to the running specimen. Washing is continued 
for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips 
or passes through the squeeze rolls. At the conclusion of the washing, 
8 liters of water at 90`F& (32`C&) are automatically metered 
from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs, 4 liters to each tub. 
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes. During the rinsing 
operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow 
from the main drain begins. At this point the drains are readjusted so 
that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line 
and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge. When 
all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the 
main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs. The 
run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line.

By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages, first 
by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter 
by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water, since 
soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly 
to waste from the suds box drains. This method of rinsing appears 
to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition. 

#SUGGESTED 
EVALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION#

Evaluation may be made on 
either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired. A 
reflectance-measuring 
instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning, whereas 
Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal. 

#PURPOSE AND SCOPE#

This test method is intended for determining 
the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics, made of fibers other 
than wool, to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering 
procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home. Four 
washing test procedures are established, varying in severity from very 
severe to very mild, and are intended to cover the range of practical 
washing from commercial procedure to hand washing. Five drying test 
procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques 
used in the home and commercial laundry. Three methods for determining 
the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those 
textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering. 
These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate 
dimensional changes after repeated launderings.   Table /1, 
summarizes all of the various washing, drying, and restoration procedures 
available. The person using these tests must determine which combination 
of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to 
evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after 
laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry. 
It is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code 
consisting of a Roman Numeral, a letter, and an Arabic number. For 
example Test /3, ~E 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed 
by procedure "/3," (at 160`F& for a total of 60 minutes 
in the machine, has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure "~E" 
and has been subjected to restorative forces on the Tension 
Presser by procedure "1". 

#PRINCIPLE#

A specimen or garment 
is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel, dried and subjected 
to restorative forces where necessary. Temperature and time of agitation 
in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity. 
Drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures 
are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial 
laundering. Distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling 
directions (or wales and courses for knitted fabrics) are measured before 
and after laundering. 

#APPARATUS AND MATERIALS#

_WASH WHEEL- 
CYLINDRICAL WASH WHEEL OF THE REVERSING TYPE._ The wheel (cage) 
is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter and 20 to 24 inches inside length. 
There 
are three fins each approximately three inches wide extending the full 
length of the inside of the wheel. One fin is located every 120` 
around the inside diameter of the wheel. The wash wheel rotates at a 
speed of 30 revolutions per minute, making five to ten revolutions before 
reversing. The water inlets are large enough to permit filling the 
wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minutes, and the outlet 
is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in 
less than two minutes. The machine is equipped with a pipe for injecting 
live steam that is capable of raising the temperature of water at 
an eight-inch level from 110` to 140`F& (38` to 60`C&) in 
less than two minutes. The machine shall contain an opening for the 
insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determining 
the temperature of the water during the washing and rinsing procedures. 
It is equipped with an outside water gauge that will indicate the 
level of the water in the wheel.   A domestic automatic washer 
that will give equivalent results may be used. The wash wheel is the 
equipment preferred for the test. _PRESSING EQUIPMENT- FLAT-BED 
PRESS MEASURING 24 INCHES BY 50 INCHES OR LARGER._ Any flat-bed press 
capable of pressing a specimen 22 inches square may be used as an 
alternative. The flat-bed press is maintained at a temperature not less 
than 275`F& (135`C&). _DRYER- DRYER OF THE ROTARY TUMBLE 
TYPE, HAVING A CYLINDRICAL BASKET APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES IN DIAMETER 
AND 24 INCHES IN LENGTH AND ROTATING AT APPROXIMATELY 35 R&P&M&._ 
The dryer is provided with a means of maintaining a drying temperature 
of 120`-160`F& (49`-71`C&), measured in the exhaust 
vent as close as possible to the drying chamber. _SCREEN DRYING 
RACKS- 16-MESH SCREENING (SARAN OR VELON)._ _DRYING ROOM-FACILITIES 
FOR DRIP- OR LINE-DRYING._ _EXTRACTOR- CENTRIFUGAL EXTRACTOR 
OF THE LAUNDRY-TYPE WITH A PERFORATED BASKET, APPROXIMATELY 11

1,500 R&P&M&._ _PEN AND INK, INDELIBLE- OR OTHER 
SUITABLE MARKING DEVICE._ _MEASURING SCALE-._ _SOAP, NEUTRAL 
CHIP- FED& SPEC& ~P ~S 566 OR ~ASTM ~D-496._ 
_SOFTENER- E&G& SODIUM METAPHOSPHATE OR SODIUM HEXAMETAPHOSPHATE

ALKYLARYSULFONATE TYPE._ _FLATIRON, ELECTRIC- APPROXIMATELY 
3 LB&_ _TENSION PRESSER- CONSISTING OF A PADDED IRONING BOARD 
FROM WHICH EXTEND CLAMPING MEMBERS ON ALL FOUR SIDES._ Two of the 
clamps are fixed to the edges of the board whereas two clamps travel on 
guide rails opposite the fixed clamps. The movable clamps travel on 
carriages which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading. 
Sets of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the 
range of 1/2 to 4 pounds. A perforated aluminum plate, used to provide 
the drying surface, is heated by means of a flatiron. A special template 
is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for 
a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps (see 
Fig& 2). _KNIT SHRINKAGE GAUGE- CONSISTING OF A SET OF 20 MOUNTING 
PINS SET IN GUIDES IN RADIAL SLOTS (FIG&1)._ Each pin is individually 
sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in 
the slot. The springs have an extension of 1 inch at **f tension. The 
tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative 
force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane 
of the test specimen. The minimum diameter of the pin frame in the 
collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely 
extended state (unloaded) is 14 inches. The surface of the apparatus 
in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as 
to be as friction-free as possible. 

#TEST SPECIMENS#

The preparation 
of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional 
restorability procedure (if any) to be used.   Three specimens 
for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory 
average of performance. This is especially true for knitted 
fabrics.   Specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with 
a standard atmosphere of **f and **f and then laid out without tension 
on a flat, polished surface, care being taken that the fabric is 
free from wrinkles or creases. Fabrics that are badly distorted in their 
unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional 
change results when laundered by any procedure. This also holds 
true 
if restorative forces are applied. Therefore, it is recommended that 
in such cases the sample be replaced, or if used, the results of dimensional 
change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative 
only.   Generally, it is necessary to mark distances on 
a specimen (or garment) in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and 
to measure before and after laundering. The distances may be marked 
with indelible ink and a fine-point pen, by sewing fine threads into 
the fabric, or by a specially designed stamping machine. The marked distances 
are parallel to the respective yarns. Usually, the greater the 
original distances marked, the greater will be the accuracy of the 
test. Distances of less than 10 inches are not recommended. _WOVEN 
FABRICS TO BE DRIED BY PROCEDURE ~B (FLAT-BED PRESSED) OR RESTORED BY 
PROCEDURE 3 (HAND IRONING):_ The specimen of fabric is a rectangle 
at least 22 by 22 inches, except for cloth narrower than 22 inches, 
in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric. Three 
distances, each at least 18 inches, are measured and marked off parallel 
to each of the warp and filling directions. The distances are at 
least two inches from any edge of the specimen. _WOVEN OR WARP KNITTED 
FABRICS TO BE SUBJECTED TO RESTORATIVE PROCEDURE 1 (TENSION PRESSER)._ 
Each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches. Place the template 
(Fig& 2) on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square 
cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven 
fabrics, or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics, and so that the 
same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all 
sides. Mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen 
and <indelible ink;> also place three dots on the specimen at each 
side of the 10 inch square, one dot at midpoint, and one at approximately 
1/2 inch from each corner. Measure and record. _CIRCULAR KNITTED 
FABRICS TO BE SUBJECTED TO RESTORATIVE PROCEDURE 2, (KNIT SHRINKAGE 
GAUGE)._ Each specimen is approximately 16 inches square. The markings 
consist of a centrally located 10 inch diameter measuring circle 
and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dots equidistantly spaced (See 
Figure 1). _GARMENTS._ Critical measurements in length and width 
directions should be taken before and after washing, drying, and restorative 
procedures. 

#PROCEDURE#

_WASHING-_ The washing 
procedures are summarized in Table /2,.   Place the specimen 
in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry 
load of **f pounds. Start the wash wheel and note the time. Immediately 
add water at 100-105`F& (38-43`C&) to the wheel to a level 
of **f inches; this level will be increased by condensed steam. 
When this water level has been reached, inject steam into the wheel until 
the temperature reaches that shown in Column ~B of Table /2,. 
Add sufficient soap (and softener if required to counteract hard 
water) to furnish a good running suds, or if desired use a synthetic detergent. 
_TEST /1,_- Stop the wash wheel at the end of the 
time 
shown in Column ~A of Table /2, and drain. Refill the machine 
to a level of **f inches with water at 100-109` F& (38-43` C&) 
and start the machine. Inject steam, if necessary, to reach the 
temperature shown in Column ~D of Table /2,. Again stop the machine 
at the end of the time shown in Column ~C of Table /2,. 
This procedure is repeated for the second rinse, using the temperatures 
and time shown in Columns ~F and ~E of Table /2,. _TESTS 
/2,, /3,, 
AND /4,._- Run the machine continuously until completion 
of the test. Drain off the soap solution of the suds cycle at such 
a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of soap and water 
at the end of the time shown in Column ~A of Table /2,, measured 
from the time the wash wheel was started. Refill the machine to a 
level of **f inches with water at 100-109` F& (38-43` C&). 
When this water level has been reached, inject steam until the temperature 
is that shown in Column ~D. Drain off the water at such a time 
that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end 
of the sum of the times shown in Columns ~A and ~C, measured from 
the time the wash wheel was started. Immediately refill to a level 
of **f inches with water at 100-109` F& (38-43` C&). When 
this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is 
that shown in Column ~F. Drain off the water at such a time that 
the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the 
sum of the times shown in Columns ~A, ~C, and ~E, measured from 
the time the wash wheel was started.

High-gain, photoelectronic image intensification is applied under 
conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time 
required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of 
practicability. Examples of such situations are (aerial) night reconnaissance, 
the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues, 
special radiography in medical or industrial applications, track recording 
of high energy particles, etc&.   High-gain photoelectronic 
image intensification may be achieved by several methods; some of 
these are listed below: _(A)_ Cascading single stages by coupling 
lens systems, _(B)_ Channel-type, secondary emission image intensifier, 
_(C)_ Image intensifier based upon the "multipactor" 
principle, _(D)_ Transmission secondary electron multiplication 
image intensifiers (~TSEM tubes), _(E)_ Cascading of single 
stages, enclosed in one common envelope.   Cascading single stages 
by <coupling lens systems> is rather inefficient as the lens systems 
limit the obtainable gain quite severely. Channel-type image intensifiers 
are capable of achieving high-gain values; suffer, however, 
from an inherently low resolution. Image intensifiers based upon 
the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable 
resolution is concerned. However, the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts 
the effective gain. ~TSEM tubes have been constructed showing 
high gain and resolution. However, electrostatic focus, important 
for many applications, has not been realized for these devices. Resolution 
limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to 
chromatic aberrations. Furthermore, the thin film dynodes appear to 
have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be 
tolerated.   <Cascaded> single stages enclosed by a <common envelope> 
have been constructed with high gain and high resolution. These 
tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system 
and in the design of the coupling members. The electron optical system 
may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one. The magnification 
may be smaller, equal, or larger than unity.   An electrostatic 
system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing 
in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen (or interstage 
coupler) is utilized, while a magnetic system requires accurate 
adjustment of the solenoid, which is heavy and bulky. As it will be discussed 
later, peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing 
curved fiber couplers. It should be noted, however, that the paraxial 
resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems. 
It is felt that fiber-coupled double- (and multi-) stage image intensifiers 
will gain considerable importance in the future. Therefore, we 
shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities 
of such tubes. The luminous efficiency and resolution of single 
stages, fiber couplers, and finally of the composite tube will be 
computed.   It will be shown theoretically that the high image 
intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits 
the utilization of extremely low incident light levels. The effect 
of device and quantum noise, associated with such low input levels, 
will be described.   After these theoretical considerations, constructional 
details of a fiber-coupled, double-stage X-ray image 
intensifier will be discussed. Measured performance characteristics 
for this experimental tube will be listed.   The conclusion shall 
be reached that fiber-coupled, double-stage tubes represent a sensible 
and practical approach to high-gain image intensification. 

#BASIC 
DESIGN OF A FIBER-COUPLED, DOUBLE-STAGE IMAGE INTENSIFIER#

The tube 
design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall 
be described now. The electron optical system (see fig& 14-1) is 
based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode 
and anode surfaces. The inner [anode] sphere is pierced, elongated 
into a cup, and terminated by the phosphor screen. The photoelectrons 
emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused 
by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres, pass through 
the [negative] lens formed by the anode aperture, and impinge 
upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen. The cylindrical focusing 
electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the 
focusing potential. The anode potential codetermines the gain, ~<G>, 
and magnification, ~<M>, of the stage.   Both the photocathode 
and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved 
concave as seen from the anode aperture. The field-flattening property 
of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the 
peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or 
coupling member. For the same reason, the output fiber plate is planoconcave, 
its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent 
record is desired. As it will be shown later, the field-flattening 
properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed 
the main advantage of such a design.   The second photocathode 
and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates. 
The photocathode sensitivities ~<S>, phosphor efficiencies 
~<P>, and anode potentials ~<V> of the individual stages shall 
be distinguished by means of subscripts /1, and /2, in the text, 
where required. Both stages are assumed to have unity magnification. 

#THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF FLUX GAIN#

_FLUX GAIN OF A SINGLE 
STAGE_ The luminous gain of a single stage with **f (flux gain) is, 
to a first approximation, given by the product of the photocathode 
sensitivity ~<S> (amp/lumen), the anode potential ~<V> (volts), 
and the phosphor conversion efficiency ~<P> (lumen-watt). In 
general, ~<P> is a function of ~<V> and the current density, 
but it shall here be assumed as a constant.   The luminous 
efficiency **f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant 
sensitivity **f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light 
**f by the relation: **f where **f **h normalized radiant photocathode 
sensitivity. **f **h standard visibility function. The luminous flux 
gain of a single stage is given by: **f If the input light distribution 
falls beyond the visible range, **f as expected, since **f. Such 
cases are not considered here. _EFFICIENCY OF FIBER COUPLERS_ 
The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on four factors: _(A)_ 
numerical aperture (N&A&). _(B)_ end (Fresnel reflection) 
losses (~<R>). 
_(C)_ internal losses (I&L&). _(D)_ 
packing efficiency (F&R&). The numerical aperture of the fibers 
is given by: **f where **f.   The angle **f is measured in 
the medium of index **f. Settled phosphors, as generally used in image 
intensifiers, have low optical contact with the substrate surface, 
hence **f shall be assumed. The numerical aperture should be in general 
close to unity. This condition can be satisfied, e&g&, with **f 
and **f or equivalent glass combinations.   A sufficiently good 
approximation for determining the end reflection losses ~<R> 
can be 
obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula: **f For phosphor 
to fiber and fiber to air surfaces, and assuming **f, we obtain 
**f percent. This value may be reduced to 4.6 percent by means of a (very 
thin) glass layer of index 1.5. Hence, the **f factor for the output 
fiber coupler is **f.   As the index of refraction of photosensitive 
surfaces of the ~SbCs-type lies around 2, the Fresnel losses 
at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the 
**f factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95. It might be anticipated 
that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further.

The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but 
finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to 
deviations from the prescribed, cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute 
imperfections of the core-jacket interface. These losses depend 
on fiber diameter and length, absorption coefficient, the mean value of 
the loss per internal reflection and last but not least, on the angular 
distribution of the incident light. Explicit expressions (integral 
averages) are given in the literature. Lacking reliable data for some 
of the variables, we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent 
internal losses for 1/4-inch long, small (5-10~|m) diameter 
fibers. This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber 
diameters increasing the number of internal reflections. Since we are 
considering here relatively small diameter (1-1.5 inches) fiber plates, 
their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal 
losses may be assumed as 15 percent (per plate).   The packing 
efficiency, F&R&, of fiber plates did not receive much attention 
in the literature, probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally 
used, until rather recently. For circular fibers in a closely 
packed hexagonal array, the packing efficiency is given by: **f where 
**f, and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the 
circumscribed hexagon. For the small diameter fibers now technically 
feasible and required for about 100 **f resolution, **f. The cladding 
thickness is about 0.5~|m, hence, **f and **f.   Thus, 
the efficiency ~|t couplers is given by- **f or approximately 
50 percent each.   It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace 
a glass window and a (mica) membrane, in addition to an optical 
output lens system. The efficiency **f of an **f lens at the magnification 
**f is: **f Neglecting absorption, the end losses of the coupling 
membrane and the output window **f would be 6 percent and 8 percent. 
Thus, the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two 
fiber plates (with a combined efficiency of 0.25) is 0.043 or <about 
six times less than that of the two fiber plates>. _GAIN OF FIBER 
COUPLED IMAGE INTENSIFIERS_ Including the brightness gain **f due 
to the **f area demagnification, the overall gain of a fiber coupled double 
stage image intensifier is: **f It is obvious that the careful 
choice of photocathode which maximizes **f for a given input ~<E> 
(in the case of the second stage, for the first phosphor screen emission) 
is very important. The same consideration should govern the choice 
of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral 
sensitivity of the ultimate sensor (e&g&, photographic emulsion).

We have evaluated the "matching integrals" for two types 
of photocathodes (~S-11 and ~S-20) and three types of light input. 
The input light distributions considered are ~P-11 and ~P-20 
phosphor emission and the so-called "night light" (N&L&) 
as given by H&W& Babcock and J& J& Johnson. The integrals 
(in @ units) are listed in table 14-/1, below: 

#THEORETICAL 
DISCUSSION OF PARAXIAL DEVICE RESOLUTION#

_RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS 
IN A SINGLE STAGE_ The resolution limitations for a single stage are 
given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as 
well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing 
screen.   The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system 
depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations. 
It has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields 
a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity 
magnification.   Furthermore, the chromatic aberrations depend 
on the chosen high voltage. In general, a high anode voltage reduces 
chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution.

The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from Eq& 
(6) for the 16 possible combinations of ~S-11 and ~S-20 photocathodes 
and ~P-11 and ~P-20 phosphor screens, for night light 
and ~P-20 light input. (The ~P-20 input is of interest because 
it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray 
fluorescent screens). The following efficiencies obtained from ~JEDEC 
and ~RCA specifications were used: **f   The following 
table (14-/2,) lists the (luminous) gain values computed according 
to Eq& (6) with **f:   The possibility of a space charge 
blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has 
been pointed out. It is obvious that such an influence can only be 
expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output 
levels. Space charge influences will also decrease at increased 
voltages.   Electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have 
been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography. 
A resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible.

The inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor 
screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness (with increasing 
anode voltage), decreases with decreasing porosity (thus the advantage 
of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition) and might be impaired by the 
normally used aluminum mirror. Thus, in general, elementary light 
optical effects, light scatter, and electron scatter determine the obtainable 
resolution limit. It should be noted that photoluminescence, 
due to "Bremsstrahlung" generated within the viewing screen by electron 
impact, appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess 
of 30 ~KV are utilized. It has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent 
phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 **f 
at high voltage values of approximately 20 ~KV. For the further discussion, 
we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 **f 
and phosphor screen resolution of 60 **f. 
The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or, more simply, 
the policy. An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the 
best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product. 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem: 
_(1)_ The specification of the state of the process stream; _(2)_ 
The specification of the operating variables and the transformation 
they effect; _(3)_ The specification of the objective function 
of which the optimization is desired. For a chemical process 
the 
first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical 
species, and the temperature or pressure of the stream. For the 
second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling 
to be supplied; the way in which the transformation of state depends 
on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed 
in the next chapter. The objective function is some measure of 
the increase in value of the stream by processing; it is the subject 
of Chapter 4.   The essential characteristic of an optimal policy 
when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages 
with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman. He recognized that 
whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an ~<R>-stage 
process, the remaining stages must use an optimal **f-stage policy 
with respect to the state resulting from the first stage, if there 
is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process. Moreover, by 
systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and 
always using the optimal **f-stage policy for the remaining stages, 
we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all ~R stages. Proceeding 
in this way, from one to two and from two to three stages, we 
may gradually build up the policy for any number. At each step of the 
calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied.

To see how important this economy is, let us suppose that there 
are ~<m> operating variables at each stage and that the state 
is specified by ~<n> variables; then the search for the maximum 
at any one stage will require a number of operations of order **f (where 
~<a> is some number not unreasonably large). To proceed from 
one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated 
to allow of interpolation; this number will be of the order 
of **f. If, however, we are seeking the optimal ~<R>-stage policy 
for a given feed state, only one search for a maximum is required at 
the final step. Thus a number of operations of the order of **f are 
required. If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously, 
**f operations would be required to do the same job, and as ~<R> 
increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations 
required by the dynamic program. But even more important than 
this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all 
operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy, namely, that 
for the given feed state and ~<R> stages. In contrast, the dynamic 
program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for 
any smaller number of stages. If the problem is enlarged to require 
a complete coverage of feed states, **f operations are needed by the dynamic 
program and **f by the direct search. But **f is vastly larger 
than ~<R>. No optimism is more baseless than that which believes 
that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the 
crudest of methods in searching out a result. Suppose that **f, and 
that the average operation requires only **f sec&. Then the dynamic 
program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would 
take 
more than three millennia!   The principle of optimality thus 
brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of 
a multistage decision process. Bellman (1957) has annunciated in the 
following terms:   "An optimal policy has the property that 
whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions 
must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting 
from the first decision".   This is the principle which 
we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation. It appears 
in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital 
computer. At the same time, every device that can be employed to reduce 
the number of variables is of the greatest value, and it is one of 
the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for 
ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end. 

#2.2 
THE DISCRETE DETERMINISTIC PROCESS#

Consider the process illustrated 
in Fig& 2.1, consisting of ~<R> distinct stages. These 
will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process 
stream, so that stage ~<r> is the ~<r>th stage from the end. 
Let the state of the stream leaving stage ~<r> be denoted by a vector 
**f and the operating variables of stage ~<r> by **f. Thus 
**f denotes the state of the feed to the ~<R>-stage process, and 
**f the state of the product from the last stage. Each stage transforms 
the state **f of its feed to the state **f in a way that depends on 
the operating variables **f. We write this **f. This transformation 
is uniquely determined by **f and we therefore speak of the process 
as deterministic. In practical situations there will be restrictions 
on the admissible operating conditions, and we regard the vectors as belonging 
to a fixed and bounded set ~<S>. The set of vectors **f 
constitutes the operating policy or, more briefly, the policy, and a 
policy is admissible if all the **f belong to ~<S>. When the policy 
has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the 
state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation (1); 
thus **f. The objective function, which is to be maximized, is some 
function, usually piecewise continuous, of the product state. Let this 
be denoted by **f.   An optimal policy is an admissible policy 
**f which maximizes the objective function ~<P>. The policy may 
not be unique but the maximum value of ~<P> certainly is, and once 
the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by (2) and (3) 
as a function of the feed state **f. Let **f where the maximization 
is over all admissible policies **f. When it is necessary to be specific 
we say that the optimal policy is an optimal ~<R>-stage policy 
with respect to the feed state **f.   For any choice of admissible 
policy **f in the first stage, the state of the stream leaving 
this stage is given by **f. This is the feed state of the subsequent 
**f stages which, according to the principle of optimality, must use an 
optimal **f-stage policy with respect to this state. This will result 
in a value **f of the objective function, and when **f is chosen correctly 
this will give **f, the maximum of the objective function. Thus 
**f 
where the maximization is over all admissible policies **f, and **f 
is related to **f by (5). The sequence of equations (6) can be solved 
for **f when **f is known, and clearly **f, the maximization being 
over all admissible **f.   The set of equations (5), (6), and the 
starting equation (7) is of a recursive type well suited to programming 
on the digital computer. In finding the optimal ~<R>-stage policy 
from that of **f stages, only the function **f is needed. When 
**f has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of 
**f and the whole calculation repeated. We also see how the results 
may be presented, although if ~<n>, the number of state variables, 
is large any tabulation will become cumbersome. A table or set of tables 
may be set out as in Table 2.1.   To extract the optimal 
~<R>-stage policy with respect to the feed state **f, we enter section 
~<R> of this table at the state **f and find immediately 
from the last column the maximum value of the objective function. In 
the third column is given the optimal policy for stage ~<R>, and 
in the fourth, the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used. 
Since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an 
optimal **f-stage policy with respect to **f, we may enter section **f 
of the table at this state **f and read off the optimal policy for stage 
**f and the resulting state **f. Proceeding in this way up the table 
we extract the complete optimal policy and, if it is desired, we 
can check on **f by evaluating **f at the last stage.   It may be 
that the objective function depends not only on **f but also on **f, 
as when the cost of the operating policy is considered. A moment's 
reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally 
well in this case. A form of objective function that we shall often 
have occasion to consider is **f. Here ~<V>({p}) represents 
the 
value of the stream in state ~{p} and ~<C>({q}) the cost 
of operating the stage with conditions ~{q}. Hence ~<P> 
is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation, that 
is, the net profit. If **f denotes the net profit from stage ~<r> 
and **f then the principle of optimality gives **f This sequence 
of equations may be started with the remark that with no process **f there 
is no profit, i&e&, **f. 

#2.3 THE DISCRETE STOCHASTIC PROCESS# 

The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only 
statistically is also of interest, although for chemical reactor design 
it is not as important as the deterministic process. In this case 
the stage ~<r> operating with conditions **f transforms the state 
of the stream from **f to **f, but only the probability distribution of 
**f is known. This is specified by a distribution function **f such 
that the probability that **f lies in some region ~<D> of the stage 
space is **f.   We cannot now speak of maximizing the value 
of the objective function, since this function is now known only in a 
probabilistic sense. We can, however, maximize its expected value. For 
a single stage we may define **f where the maximization is by choice 
of **f. We thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected 
value of the objective function for a given **f. If we consider a process 
in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the 
next, then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent 
stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first. 
Then **f, the maximization being over all admissible **f and the integration 
over the whole of stage space.   The type of presentation 
of results used in the deterministic process may be used here, except 
that now the fourth column is redundant. The third column gives 
the optimal policy, but we must wait to see the outcome of stage ~<R> 
and enter the preceding section of the table at this state. The 
discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not 
known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter. 

#2.4 THE CONTINUOUS DETERMINISTIC PROCESS#

In many cases it is not 
possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages, 
since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner 
through the process. We replace ~<r>, the number of the stage 
from the end of the process, by ~<t>, a continuous variable which 
measures the "distance" of the point considered from the end of the 
process. The word <distance> is used here in a rather general sense; 
it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the 
process. If ~<T> is the total "length" of the process, its 
feed state may be denoted by a vector ~{p}(<T>) and the product 
state by ~{p}(O). ~{p}(<t>) denotes the state at 
any point ~<t> and ~{q}(<t>) the vector of operating variables 
there.

A gyro-stabilized platform system, using restrained gyros, is 
well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the 
gyro-platform-servo combination. The restrained gyro-stabilized platform 
with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate 
equation of motion, neglecting transient effects, as follows: 
**f where ~<U> is a torque applied about the output axis of the 
controlling gyro.   The platform angle ~|f is the angle about 
which the gyro is controlling. This is normally termed the gyro input 
axis, 90` away from the gyro output or ~|j axis. The gyro angular 
momentum is defined by ~<H>.   Thus if the gyro and platform-controller 
combination maintains the platform with zero angular 
deviation about the ~|f axis, the system can be rotated with an 
angular velocity **f if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis ~|j. 
It is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers 
so that a torque can be applied about their output axes. 
In the system shown in Fig& 7-1, the accelerometer output is amplified 
and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer. 
This torque causes the entire system to rotate about the ~|f 
axis, since the response to **f. If the polarities are correct, the 
platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output 
to zero. As the accelerometer output is decreasing, the torque applied 
to the gyro output axis decreases and, therefore, the rate decreases. 
Finally, when the accelerometer output is zero, the entire system 
remains stationary, and the platform is, by definition, leveled.

A mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in 
Fig& 7-2. The platform is initially off level by the angle ~|f. 
The angle generated by the platform servo ~|f multiplied by ~<g> 
is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer. **f 
is the scale factor of the accelerometer (**f). The voltage **f is amplified 
by **f and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor **f. 
Finally, the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented 
by **f The system as indicated in Fig& 7-2 is fundamental and simple 
because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the 
accelerometer have been neglected. With these factors included, an upper 
limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations. 
In this type of system, a high loop gain is desirable because it 
provides a fast response time.   When the frequency response characteristics 
of practical components are considered, their effect on 
stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop 
gain. The time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately 
inversely proportional to the servo loop gain. In addition, 
the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional 
to the servo loop gain; i&e&, high loop gain causes the 
system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations. This problem 
usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response 
time.   It must be noticed in Fig& 7-1 that the accelerometer 
responds to any input acceleration. The equation relating input 
acceleration to output platform angle is **f In practice, the preflight 
leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe. 
When the system is arranged for automatic leveling, the platform 
angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on 
the accelerometers. There are many such components of acceleration present 
due to the effect of wind gusts, engine noise, turbulence around 
the vehicle, etc&. One of the greatest problems associated with automatic 
leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level 
acceleration noise. One solution to the problem is to operate 
with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters. This technique 
causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components 
such as the platform tilt. Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering 
increases the response time, a practical compromise must be reached.

One of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the 
use of a non-linear amplifier for **f. The amplifier is designed so 
that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold 
level. Below this level, the amplifier gain **f is proportional 
and is of small value, in order to provide adequate noise filtering. The 
effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at 
a rapid rate until it is nearly level, at which point the platform is 
controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response 
so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process.   When 
the system is on automatic leveling, the gyro drift is canceled by 
the output of the leveling system (amplifier **f). The platform actually 
tilts off level so that the accelerometer output, when amplified 
by **f, will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel 
the gyro drift. The amount of platform dip required depends upon the 
scale factors of the system. 

#7-3. PRACTICAL LEVELING 
CONSIDERATIONS.# 

The automatic leveling system described in this section is readily 
adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating 
gyros. The system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits. 
However, the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled 
remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform.

This leveling system will hold the platform on-level, automatically, 
as long as the system is actuated. A useful by-product of this 
system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases 
is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level.

The leveling process can be accomplished manually, and the results 
are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment. The 
process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs 
of both accelerometers are zero. The turning is accomplished by applying 
voltage to the gyro torquers described above. In brief, the human 
replaces amplifier **f in Figs& 7-1 and 7-2.   Manual leveling 
requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs. If 
high accuracy is required in preflight leveling, it is usually necessary 
to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs (this also 
minimizes the noise problem). With integration, the effect of a small 
acceleration (or small platform tilt angle) can be seen after a time. 
However, skill is required on the part of an operator to level a 
platform to any degree of accuracy. Also, it requires more time as 
compared to the automatic approach.   Manual leveling is inconvenient 
if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged 
period of time. The operator must continually supply the correct 
amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of 
gyro drift is canceled. This process is especially difficult since gyro 
drifting is typically random. 

#7-4. PLATFORM HEADING.#

Platform 
heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers 
parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator. In simpler 
terms, it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction.

For purely inertial navigators, two techniques are available 
to accomplish the platform heading: _1._ Use of external or 
surveying equipment to establish proper heading. _2._ Use of the 
characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true 
heading The choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy 
requirements, field conditions, and the time available to accomplish 
the heading. 

#7-5. EXTERNAL DETERMINATION OF HEADING- SURVEYING 
TECHNIQUE.#

With the gyro-stabilized platform leveled, it can be 
headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques. The platform 
accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure. Before 
the accelerometers are mounted on the platform, the direction of 
their sensitive axis must be accurately determined. A mirror is mounted 
on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular 
to the sensitive axis of the unit. _TRANSIT._ A precision transit 
is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north. This 
can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques. 
With the transit set up, a mirror on one of the accelerometers 
is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned.   The 
sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to 
project a beam of light, which is darkened by crossed hairs, on the accelerometer 
mirror. When the platform is aligned, the reflected image 
of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original 
crossed hairs. The images can easily be aligned with a high degree 
of accuracy. The platform is turned as required by supplying currents 
to the appropriate gyro torquers.   Although this technique is 
simple and satisfactory, one practical difficulty does exist: the direction 
of true north must be known for each launch point. However, 
this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying 
team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work.

In many installations, the inertial platform is raised off the ground 
a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight. 
With this situation, it is difficult to sight in on the platform with 
surveying equipment. 
If the platform is not too high off the ground, 
a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform. 
Obviously, the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since 
errors are introduced because of motion of the stand. _AUTOCOLLIMATOR._ 
The transit can be replaced by an autocollimator. This instrument 
provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations 
of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform 
on true heading. The electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified 
and supplied to the ~<Z>-gyro torquer. If the polarity is 
correct, the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero. 
Information is also available from this autocollimator system to set 
the drift bias for the ~<Z>-axis gyro. If the ~<Z> gyro 
is drifting, a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to 
the gyro torquer to cancel the drift. If the drift error is systematic, 
it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted 
to supply the required compensating current. _ELECTRICAL PICKOFFS._ 
It is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff, which 
will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction 
and the platform. Essentially, the stator or reference portion of 
the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction, 
and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the 
angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero. 

#7-6. GYROCOMPASS 
HEADING.#

Gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system 
which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true 
heading. For the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of 
three restrained gyros, a coordinate system is used where the sensitive 
axis of the ~<X> accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction 
at the base point, and the ~<Y> accelerometer sensitive 
axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point. The 
accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform. Thus, if one accelerometer 
is properly aligned, the other is also. The input axis of the 
appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers.

Figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro 
vectors arranged as described above. The platform is leveled and properly 
headed, so that the ~<X>-gyro input axis is parallel to the 
east-west direction and the ~<Y>-gyro input axis is parallel to 
the north-south direction.   The input axis of the ~<X> gyro, 
when pointing in the east-west direction, is always perpendicular to 
the spin axis of earth. If the platform is not properly headed, the 
~<X>-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation. 
The sensing of this rotation by the ~<X> gyro can be utilized 
to direct the platform into proper heading.   In Fig& 7-4, 
the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the 
earth. The point is at a latitude ~|l, and the platform is at 
an error in heading east. The earth is spinning at an angular velocity 
~\q equal to one revolution per 24 hr&. When the platform is 
level, ~|e is a rotation about the ~<Z> axis of the platform 
**f. Since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform 
is fixed with respect to a reference in space, an observer on 
the earth will see the platform rotating (with respect to the earth). 

#THIRTY-THREE#

SCOTTY did not go back to school. His parents 
talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist 
at the University Hospital- Mr& McKinley was entitled to a 
discount for members of his family- and it was decided it would be 
best for him to take the remainder of the term off, spend a lot of time 
in bed and, for the rest, do pretty much as he chose- provided, of 
course, he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating. His 
teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed 
that, if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home, there was 
little danger of his losing a term.   Scotty accepted the decision 
with indifference and did not enter the arguments.   He was 
discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his 
parents had what Mr& McKinley described as a "celebration lunch" 
at the cafeteria on the campus. Rachel wore a smart hat and, because 
she had been warned recently about smoking, puffed at her cigarettes 
through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick. Scotty's father 
sat sprawled in his chair, angular, alert as a cricket, looking about 
at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression 
of proprietorship.   Teachers- men who wore brown suits and 
had gray hair and pleasant smiles- came to their table to talk shop 
and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel. Rachel was polite, Scotty 
indifferent. They ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces 
and Scotty gazed without interest at his food, the teachers, the heroic 
baronial windows, and the bright ranks of college banners. His father 
tried to make the food a topic.   "The blueberry pie is good, 
Scotty. I recommend it". He looked at his son, his face worried. 
Scotty murmured, "No, thanks", so softly his father had to 
bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him. 
Scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment 
of interest. He said more loudly, "I'm full, old Pop". He 
had eaten almost nothing on the crested, three-sectioned plate and 
had drunk about half the milk in its paper container.   "He's 
all right, Craig", Rachel said. "I can fix him something later 
in the afternoon when we get home".   Since his seizure, Scotty 
had had little appetite; yet his changed appearance, surprisingly, 
was one of plumpness. His face was fuller; his lips and the usually 
sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking. He breathed now 
with his mouth open, showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth; 
he kept his eyes, with their puffed blurred lids, always lowered, 
though not, apparently, focusing. Even his neck seemed thicker and 
therefore shorter. His hands, which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering 
birds, were now neither active nor really relaxed. They lay 
on his lap, palms up, stiffly motionless, the tapered fingers a little 
thick at the joints. Altogether he had, since the seizure, the appearance 
of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise. He looked 
lazy, spoiled, a little querulous.   Rachel had little to say. 
She greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness, offering 
nothing. Mr& McKinley, for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity, 
was completely alert to his son, eyes always on the still 
face, jumping to anticipate Scotty's desires. It was a strained, silent 
lunch.   Rachel said, "I'd better get him to bed".

The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon 
in bed until he was stronger.   Since Mr& McKinley had to 
give a lecture, Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth. 
They did not speak much. Scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and 
said softly, "Look at those stupid kids". It was a Negro section 
of peeling row houses, store-front churches and ragged children. Rachel 
had to bend toward Scotty and ask him to repeat. He said, "Nothing". 
And then: "There are lots of kids around here".

Scotty looked at the children, his mouth slightly opened, his eyes 
dull. He felt tired and full and calm. 

#THIRTY-FOUR#

THE 
days seemed short, perhaps because his routine was, each day, almost 
the same. He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to 
have breakfast either alone or with Rachel. Virginia treated him with 
attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food: biscuits, 
cookies, candies- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen. 
She would hover over him and, looking like her brother, anxiously 
watch the progress of Scotty's fork or spoon.   "You don't 
eat enough, honey. Try to get that down".   Rachel, observing, 
would say, "He has to rediscover his own capacity. It'll 
take time".   Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly 
now, as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war 
atmosphere. Both watched Scotty constantly, Rachel without seeming 
to, Virginia openly, her eyes filled with concern. Scotty was neutral. 
He did not resent their supervision or Virginia's sometimes tiring 
sympathy. He ate what he felt like, slept as much or as little as 
he pleased, and moved about the draughty rooms of the house, when he 
was not in bed, with slow dubious steps, like an elderly tourist in a 
cathedral. His energy was gone. He was able, now, to sit for hours 
in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without 
moving. His hands lay loosely, yet stiffly- they were like wax hands: 
almost lifelike, not quite- folded in his lap; his mouth hung 
slightly open. When he was asked a question or addressed in such a way 
that some response was inescapable, he would answer; if, as often 
happened, he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly, he would 
repeat his words in the same way, without emphasis or impatience, only 
a little louder.   He had not mentioned Kate. He had not even 
thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his 
slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly, almost accidentally, encounter 
her. At these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest, but 
it was an objective pain, in no way different from others in intensity 
and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged wound on the back 
of his head which occasionally throbbed; it was merely another part 
of his weakness. He was calm, drugged, and lazy. He did not care.

Rachel mentioned Kate. She said, "I notice the girl from 
across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit".   Scotty 
said, "That's all right. Kate's all right". He thought 
about it briefly, then deliberately turned the talk to something else.

Once, sitting at the front window in his parents' room, he 
saw Kate come out of her house. She was with Elizabeth. They were 
far off and looked tiny. The heavy branches in his front yard would hide 
and then reveal them. They turned at the bottom of Kate's steps 
and moved off in the direction of the park. He thought he saw- it 
awakened and, for a moment, interested him- that Elizabeth held a 
leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash. 
Then they disappeared and Scotty got up and went into his own 
room and got into bed. By the time he was under the covers he had forgotten 
about seeing Kate.   The doctor, since Scotty was no longer 
allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him, came often 
and informally to the house. He would sit, slim-waisted and spare, 
on the edge of Scotty's bed, his legs crossed so elaborately that the 
crossed foot could tap the floor. Scotty did not mind the doctor's 
unsmiling teasing as he used to.   "Husky young man", he 
said with mock distaste. "I imagine you're always battling in school".

"I don't go to school any more".   "Pardon"? 
The doctor had to bend close to hear; his delicate hand, as 
veined as a moth's wing, rested absently on Scotty's chest. Scotty 
said the same words more loudly. "Oh. Well, we're taking a 
little vacation, that's all". He turned unsmilingly to Rachel. "I 
think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little. 
He could now but the weakness is very definite; it would exhaust 
him further and unnecessarily. He'll be stronger soon". His stethoscope 
was on the table by Scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged 
it at Scotty. He said fussily, "Just keep the cap on those 
strong emotions". The stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room. 
"I'll drop by again in a few days".   Rachel stayed 
on after the doctor had gone. She smoothed the covers on Scotty's 
bed and picked things up from the floor. She did not touch him. Scotty 
watched with disinterest. He did not speak. He had no desire to.

She said, "Do you think you'll miss school"?   He 
had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown. He did 
not care. He felt her irritability did not concern him, yet he knew 
he would not care even if it did. He shook his head.   "We've 
had any number of calls about you. You could win a popularity contest 
at that school without any trouble. Miss Estherson called twice. 
She wants to pay you a visit. She says the children miss you. Apparently 
you were the light of their lives".   Scotty shrugged 
slightly. Rachel came close to the bed, bent as if she would kiss him, 
then moved away. She was frowning. "That doctor annoys me". She 
seemed to speak to herself. "Do you suppose his self-consciousness 
is characteristic of the new Negro professionals or merely of doctors 
in general"?   She turned to him again. "Well, Mrs& 
Charles- Sally- has phoned too. She was very worried". Rachel's 
tone was dry. "She didn't really say"- She glanced 
away at the floor, then swooped gracefully and picked up one of Scotty's 
slippers. "I mean, do you feel like seeing Kate"?

Scotty said, "I don't know". It was true. He did not. There 
was the slight pain, but it was no different from the throbbing in 
his head.   "Well, there's time, in any case. We'll wait 
till you're stronger and then talk about it". She put the slipper 
neatly 
by its mate at the foot of the bed.   Scotty said, "Okay".

This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead. Scotty 
was pleased.   His father was a constant visitor. Scotty 
would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep 
slow voice; it floated up the stairs.   "How's Scotty"?

And Rachel's or Virginia's reply: "Better. He's 
getting plenty of rest".   "Is his appetite improved"? 
Or: "Does he get exercise"?   The exchange was almost 
invariable, and Scotty, in his bed, could hear every word of it. He 
never smiled. It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical 
about his father. His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously 
at the foot of the bed and look at his son. After a pause, 
during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there 
and could not study him too, Mr& McKinley would ask the same 
questions he had asked downstairs.   Scotty would reply softly and 
his father, apologetically, would ask him to repeat.   "I'm 
eating more", he would say. Or: "I walk around the house a 
lot".   "Perhaps you should get out a little".   "I'm 
not supposed to yet". He was not irritated. He did not mind 
the useless, kindly questions. He looked at the lined face with vague 
interest; he felt he was noting it, as if it were something he might 
think about when he grew stronger.   Mr& McKinley examined 
everything with critical care, seeking something material to blame for 
his son's illness.   "Have you got enough blankets"? And 
another time, without accusation: "You never wore that scarf 
I bought you". 
Where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves 
upward in angry motion, Papa-san sat glacier-like, his smooth solidity, 
his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him. "Our 
objective", the colonel had said that day of the briefing, "is Papa-san". 
There the objective sat, brooding over all. Gouge, burn, 
blast, insult it as they would, could anyone really take Papa-san?

Between the ponderous hulk and himself, in the valley over which 
Papa-san reigned, men had hidden high explosives, booby traps, and 
mines. The raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion. On 
the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed 
wire. At the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye 
range like a wild tangle of children's hoops, stopped simultaneously, 
weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to 
start them all rolling again. Closer still, regular barricades of barbed 
wire hung on timber supports. Was it all vain labor? Who would 
clean up the mess when the war was over? Smiling at his quixotic 
thoughts, Warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before 
sitting down. Tonight a group of men, tomorrow night he himself, 
would go out there somewhere and wait. If he were to go with White, 
he would be out there two days, not just listening in the dark at some 
point between here and Papa-san, but moving ever deeper into enemy 
land- behind Papa-san itself. Was this what he had expected? He 
hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think, so many 
lulls. Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told, that combat 
was an intermittent activity. Now he knew that the moment illuminated 
by the vision on the train would have to be approached. It could 
take place tomorrow night, or it might occur months from now. There 
was just too much time. Time to become afraid. White's suggestion 
flattered, but he did not like the identity. He did not spill over with 
hatred for the enemy. He hadn't even seen him yet **h   Pressing 
his cigarette out in the earth, Warren walked to the slit and 
scanned the jagged hills. He saw no life, but still stood there for 
a time peering at the unlovely hills, his gaze continually returning to 
Papa-san. He had come here in order to test himself. While most of 
his beliefs were still unsettled, he knew that he did not believe in 
killing. Yet, he was here. He had come because he could not live out 
his life feeling that he had been a coward. ##

There were ten men 
on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night. The 
beaming ~ROK was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun; another 
man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition. Warren and White each 
carried, in addition to their own weapons and ammo, a box of ammo for 
the ~ROK's machine gun. Others carried extra clips for the 
Browning Automatic Rifle, which was in the hands of a little Mexican 
named Martinez. Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon. 
"We just sit quiet and wait", Prevot had said. "Be sure the 
man nearest you is awake. If Joe doesn't show up, we'll all be 
back here at 0600 hours. Otherwise, we hold a reception. Then we pull 
out under our mortar and artillery cover, but nobody pulls out until 
I say so. Remember what I said about going out to get anybody left 
behind? That still holds. We bring back all dead and wounded".

At 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the 
point of departure. Then began the journey through their own mine fields. 
Mines. Ours were kinder than theirs, some said. They set bouncing 
betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully 
had them go off at the head. Mines. Big ones and little. The crude 
wooden boxes of the enemy, our nicely turned gray metal disks. But 
theirs defied the detectors. Mines. A foot misplaced, a leg missing. 
Mines. All sizes: big ones, some wired to set off a whole field, 
little ones, hand grenade size. Booby traps to fill the head with 
chunks of metal. Warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by 
looking at the sky. It was dark. Prevot had said that the searchlights 
would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours, "which gives us time 
to get settled in position".   Because they were new men and 
to be sure that they didn't get lost, Prevot had placed Warren 
and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out. His eyes now 
fixed on White's solid figure, Warren could hear behind him the tread 
of another. He could also hear the stream which he had seen from 
his position. They were going to follow it for part of their journey. 
"It's safe", Prevot had said, "and it provides cover for our 
noise".   Soon they were picking their way along the edge of 
the stream which glowed in the night. On their right rose the embankment 
covered with brush and trees. If a branch extended out too far, 
each man held it back for the next, and if they met a low overhang, each 
warned the other. Thus, stealthily they advanced upstream; then 
they turned to the right, climbed the embankment, and walked into the 
valley again. There was no cover here, only grass sighing against 
pant-legs. And with each sigh, like a whip in the hand of an expert, 
the grass stripped something from Warren. The gentle whir of each footstep 
left him more naked than before, until he felt his unprotected 
flesh tremble, chilled by each new sound. The shapes of the men ahead 
of him lacked solidity, as if the whip had stripped them of their very 
flesh. The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage, 
their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords. The warped, broken 
trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes. Clumps of brush that 
they passed were so many enchained demons straining 
in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones. Looming over all, Papa-san 
leered down at him, threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies. Off in 
the distance a searchlight flashed on, its beam slashing the sky. The 
sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud, then reflected to the earth in a 
softer, diffused radiance. Somewhere over there another patrol had need 
of light. Warren thought of all the men out that night who, like 
himself, had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their 
guts- picked their way into the area beyond. From the east to the west 
coast of the Korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled 
men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night, 
sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound, or shouting 
amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts. White's arm went 
up and Warren raised his own. The patrol was stopping.   Prevot 
came up "Take that spot over there", he whispered, pointing to 
a small clump of blackness. "Give me your machine gun ammo". Warren 
handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the 
line.   Lying in the grass behind the brush clump, Warren looked 
about. The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and 
the brush. Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun 
crew. Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes, setting 
up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the 
heads of the rest of the patrol.   Warren eased his rifle's 
safety off and gently, slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from 
one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with 
an ~X. This he placed within quick reach. The walk and his fears 
had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch 
of the night air. Although the armored vest fitted the upper part 
of his body snugly, he felt no security. Figures seemed to crouch in 
the surrounding dark; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed 
to advance and retreat even as he watched. Certain this menace was 
only imaginary, he yet stared in fascinated horror, his hand sticky against 
the stock of his weapon. He was aware of insistent inner beatings, 
as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body. 
Above, the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds, 
diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light. Then the figures 
which held his attention became a group of shattered trees, standing 
like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene. Even so, he could 
not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself 
seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax. Sensing the 
unseen presence of the other men in the patrol, he felt mutely united 
to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him. 
He sensed something precious in the perilous moment, something akin 
to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside, 
a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness.  - In France 
he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown 
up to the sky, and always as he wandered, he felt a stranger to their 
exultation. They were poems in a strange language, of which he could 
barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being ache with the desire 
for the fullness he sensed there. Brittany, that stone-gray mystery 
through which he traveled for thirty days, sleeping in the barns of 
farmers or alongside roads, had worked some subtle change in him, he 
knew, and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre.   Pierre 
had no hands; they had been severed at the wrists. With leather cups 
fitted in his handlebars, he steered his bicycle. He and Warren had 
traveled together for four days. They visited the shipyards at Brest 
and Pierre had to sign the register, vouching for the integrity of 
the visiting foreigner. He took the pen in his stumps and began to 
write.   "Wait! Wait"! cried the guard who ran from the 
hut to shout to other men standing about outside. They crowded the small 
room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless 
man write his name in the book.   "C'est formidable", 
they exclaimed.   "Mais, oui. C'est merveilleux". 
And then the questions came, eager, interested questions, and many compliments 
on his having overcome his infirmity.   "Doesn't it 
ever bother you", Warren had asked, "to have people always asking 
you about your hands"?   "Oh, the French are a very curious 
people", Pierre had laughed. "They are also honest seekers 
after truth. Now the English are painfully silent about my missing 
hands. They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there. The 
Americans, like yourself, take the fact for granted, try to be helpful, 
but don't ask questions. I'm used to all three, but I think 
the French have the healthiest attitude".   That was the day 
that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey of Solesmes. "You 
are looking tired and there you can rest. It will be good for you. 
I think, too", he said, his dark eyes mischievous, "that you will 
find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you 
have spoken".   Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell 
at the abbey gate. The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his 
worries about his reception: "I speak English", the old man 
said, "but I do not hear it very well". He smiled and stuck a large 
finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that 
might help. Smiling at Warren's protestations, the old monk took 
his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor. "Will 
you please wait in here. 
MICKIE SAT over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next 
to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue. Al's Little Cafe 
was small, dark, narrow, and filled with the mingled scent of beer, 
tobacco smoke, and Italian cooking. Hanging over the bar was an oil 
painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran 
Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke. The nude was small 
and black-haired and elfin, and was called "Eloise".   This 
was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without 
anyone noticing him, or at least coming up and hanging around and 
wanting to know all the low-down. The other patrons were taxi drivers 
and art students and small shopkeepers. The reporters had not yet 
discovered that this was his hideaway.   His friend Jane was with 
him. She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even 
if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint. She was the widow 
of a writer who had died in an airplane crash, and Mickie had found 
her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury. This 
meant sorting out press clippings and the like.   Jane sat receptive 
and interested. Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said, "You see, 
both of them, I mean the President and Jeff Lawrence, are romantics. 
A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and 
all he has to do is find the right key, and then divine justice and 
altruism will appear. It's like focusing a camera; the distant ship 
isn't there until you get the focus. You know what I'm talking 
about. I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live 
with them.   "But when it comes to war, the Colonel knows what 
it is and Jeff doesn't. Mr& Christiansen knows that a soldier 
will get the Distinguished Service Medal for conduct that would land 
him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian. He had 
a mean, unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit, and someone invented the 
name Trig for him. That's to say, he was trigger happy. He'd 
shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry. 
He was a wiry, inscrutable, silent country boy from the red clay of 
rural Alabama, and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally 
make fun of. But not in front of Trig. I heard of some that tried 
it back in the States, and he'd knock them clear across the room. 
There'd been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base. A New 
York kid, a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs, made fun of Trig's 
accent, and drew a knife. Before the fight was over, the Harlem 
boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly. They caught Trig 
stealing liquor from the officers' mess, and he got a couple of girls 
in trouble. The fear of punishment just didn't bother him. It wasn't 
there. It was left out of him at birth. This is why he made such 
a magnificent soldier. He wasn't troubled with the ordinary, rank-and-file 
fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers 
and whole companies under fire running in panic. It just didn't 
occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him. Do you get 
the picture of the kind of fellow he was"?   Jane nodded 
with a pleasant smile.   "All right. There was a sniper's nest 
in a mountain cave, and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy. 
The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out, and I suggested, 
'You ask for volunteers, and promise each man on the patrol a quart 
of whisky, ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao'. Trig was 
one of the five volunteers. The patrol snaked around in back of the cave, 
approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls. 
You could hear them from our outpost. There was a lot of shooting. 
We knew the enemy was subdued, because a flare was fired as the signal. 
So we hurried over. Two of our men were killed, a third was wounded. 
Trig and a very black colored boy from Detroit had killed or put 
out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting. When 
we got there, Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession 
of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded Filipino. The colored 
boy had it, and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said, 'Give 
that to me, you black bastard. We don't 'low nigras to walk on 
the same sidewalk with white men where I come from'.   "The 
Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound".   "What 
did the Colonel do about the men"? Jane asked in her placid, 
interested way.   Mickie laughed. "He recommended both of 
them for the ~DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple Heart, 
too, for a combat-inflicted wound. So you see Mr& Christiansen 
knows what it's all about. But not Jeff Lawrence. When he was in 
the war, he was in Law or Supplies or something like that, and an 
old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon 
and read the citations for medals- just like the one we sent in for 
Trig- and go away with a real glow. These were heroes nine feet 
tall to him". ##

Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small, perfectly 
appointed table by the window looking out over the river. He 
had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern 
of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with 
two heads. Open beside him was <Mrs& Dalloway>. He thought how 
this dainty, fragile older woman threading her way through the streets 
of Westminster on a day in June, enjoying the flowers in the shops, 
the greetings from old friends, but never really drawing a deep, passionate 
breath, was so like himself. He, and Mrs& Dalloway, too, 
had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the 
bone marrow of the spirit.   He had not because he was both poor 
and ambitious. Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious. 
They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars 
along a dark country lane. No, they must look the other way and climb 
one more painful step up the ladder. He made the decision with his 
eyes open, or so he thought. At any cost, he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania 
mining town where his father was a pharmacist. And so he 
had, so he had. At State College, he had no time to walk among the 
violets on the water's edge. From his room he could look out in springtime 
and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly, deliciously, 
across the campus, and he could smell the sweet vernal winds. He was 
not stone. He was not unmoved. He had to teach himself patiently that 
these traps were not for him. He must mentally pull the blinds and 
close the window, so that all that existed was in the books before him. 
At law school, the same. More of this stamping down of human emotion 
as a young lawyer in New York. By the time he was prosperous enough- 
his goals were high- he was bald and afraid of women. The only 
one who would have him was his cripple, the strange unhappy woman 
who became his wife. Perhaps it was right; perhaps it was just. He 
had dared to defy nature, to turn his back to the Lorelei, and he was 
punished. Like Mrs& Dalloway, with her regrets about Peter Walsh, 
he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent. If 
he had had a son, he would tell him, "Gather ye rosebuds while ye 
may **h This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying". 
But then his son could afford it.   Lawrence was waiting for Bill 
Boxell. The Vice President had called and asked if he could see 
the Secretary at his home. He said the matter was urgent. The Secretary 
was uneasy about the visit. He did not like Boxell. He suspected 
something underhanded and furtive about him. Lawrence could not 
put his finger on it precisely, and this worried him. When you disliked 
or distrusted a man, you should have a reason. Human nature was 
not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell. Lawrence stared 
a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic, hoping that a clue to his 
dislike of the Vice President would appear. It did not. Therefore, 
he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort 
to understand and sympathize with his point of view.   A half 
hour later the Vice President arrived. He looked very carefully at 
every piece of furnishing, as though hoping to store this information 
carefully in his mind. He observed the Florentine vase in the hall, 
the Renoir painting in the library, as well as the long shelves of well-bound 
volumes; the pattern of the Oriental rug, the delicate cut-glass 
chandelier.   He said to the Secretary, "I understand 
you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre. How did 
you find out about this"? He waved his arm around at the furnishings.

It was not a discourteous question, Lawrence decided. 
This young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious; 
he had to find out. The Secretary did not tell him at what cost, at 
what loneliness, he learned these things. He merely said, "Any good 
decorator these days can make you a tasteful home".   The Vice 
President said, "If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap 
in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's 
home, let me know. I can do business with that kind".   Again, 
Lawrence thought a little sadly, these were the fees of poverty and 
ambition. Boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously. He 
had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years.   They 
had brandy in the library. Boxell looked at Lawrence with a searching 
glance, the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial. 
What are your weaknesses? Where will you break? How best to 
destroy your peace?   The Vice President said with a slight 
bluster, "There isn't anyone who loves the President more than 
I do. Old Chris is my ideal. At the same time, you have to face facts 
and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his 
life doesn't understand much about politics. What does a monk know 
about sex"?   Lawrence listened with the practiced, deceptive 
calm of the lawyer, but his face was in the shadow.   "So, 
we have to protect the old man for his own good. You see what I mean. 
Congress is full of politicians, and if you want to get along with 
them, you have to be politic. This is why I say we just can't go ahead 
and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses. Let me tell 
you what happened to me today. A fellow came up to me, a Senator, 
I don't have to tell you his name, and he told me, 'I love the 
President like a brother, but God damn it, he's crucifying me. I've 
got a quarter of a million Germans in my state, and those krautheads 
tune in on Father Werther every night, and if he tells them to 
go out and piss in the public square, that's what they do. He's 
telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament 
of Germany'. And another one comes to me and he says, 'Look 
here, there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people 
making uniforms for the Navy. 
The Bishop looked at him coldly and said "Take it or leave it"!

Literally, there was nothing else to do. He was caught in 
a machine. But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite 
calmly: "Let's go and see what it's like".   Annisberg 
was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham, near the Georgia 
border and on the Tallahoosa River, a small and dirty stream. The 
city was a center of manufacture, especially in textiles, and also 
because of the beauty of some of its surroundings, a residence for many 
owners of the great industries in north Alabama. But it had, as was 
usual in southern cities of this sort, a Black Bottom, a low region 
near the river where the Negroes lived- servants and laborers huddled 
together in a region with no sewage save the river, where streets 
and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime.

Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city 
over; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief 
stores were. Beyond were industries and factories. Then they went down 
to Black Bottom. In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen 
African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was an old and dirty 
wooden structure, sadly in need of repair. But it was a landmark. It 
had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town, black and white, 
knew of it. It had just suffered a calamity, the final crisis in a 
long series of calamities. For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five 
years was dead, and the city mourned him.   He was a 
loud-voiced man, once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength 
and ability. He was stern and overbearing with his flock, but obsequious 
and conciliatory with the whites, especially the rich who partly 
supported the church. The Deacon Board, headed by a black man 
named Carlson, had practically taken over as the pastor grew old, and 
had its way with the support of the Amen corner. The characteristic 
thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious 
orgy. A knot of old worshippers, chiefly women, listened weekly to a 
sermon. It began invariably in low tones, almost conversational, and 
then gradually worked up to high, shrill appeals to God and man. And 
then the Amen corner took hold, re-enacting a form of group participation 
in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus, spreading 
down through the African forest, overseas to the West Indies, 
and then here in Alabama. With shout and slow dance, with tears and 
song, with scream and contortion, the corner group was beset by hysteria 
and shivering, wailing, shouting, possession of something that seemed 
like an alien and outside force. It spread to most of the audience 
and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief 
and afterward discussed Negro religion. It sometimes ended in 
death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and 
floor. To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent 
and beautiful experience, something for which they lived from week 
to week. It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday 
night prayer meeting.   Wilson, on his first Sunday, witnessed 
this with something like disgust. He had preached a short sermon, 
trying to talk man-to-man to the audience, to tell them who he was, what 
he had done in Macon and Birmingham, and what he proposed to do here. 
He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor. But then, 
at mention of that name, the Amen corner broke loose. He had no 
chance to say another word. At the very end, when the audience was silent 
and breathless, a collection was taken and then slowly everyone 
filed out. The audience did not think much of the new pastor, and what 
the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to 
say.   During the next weeks he looked over the situation. First 
of all there was the parsonage, an utterly impossible place for civilized 
people to live in, originally poorly conceived, apparently not 
repaired for years, with no plumbing or sewage, with rat-holes and rot. 
It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old 
members of the church, a woman named Catt who, as Wilson afterward found, 
was briefly referred to as The Cat because of her sharp tongue 
and fierce initiative.   Ann Catt was a lonely, devoted soul, 
never married, conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church, but 
a perpetual dissenter and born critic. She soared over the new pastor 
like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all 
the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository.   Then 
Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition. The salary 
of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears. 
Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500, 
but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing. The church 
itself must be repaired. It was dirty and neglected. It really 
ought to be rebuilt, and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks 
about this. Meanwhile, the city itself should be talked to. The 
streets in the colored section were dirty. There was typhoid and malaria. 
The children had nowhere to go and no place to play, not even sidewalks. 
The school was small, dark and ill-equipped. The teacher was 
a pliant fool. There were two liquor saloons not very far from the 
church, one white, that is conducted for white people with a side entrance 
for Negroes; the other exclusively Negro. Undoubtedly, there 
was a good deal of gambling in both.   On the other side of the 
church 
was a quiet, well-kept house with shutters and recently painted. Wilson 
inquired about it. It was called Kent House. The deacon of the 
church, Carlson, was its janitor. One of the leading members of the 
Amen corner was cook; there were two or three colored maids employed 
there. Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people, 
which seemed to him rather queer. Why should a white hotel be set 
down in the center of Black Bottom? But nevertheless it looked respectable. 
He was glad to have it there.   The rest of Black 
Bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect, disrepair 
and careful upkeep. Dives, carefully repaired huts, and nicely 
painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl 
with little distinction. The best could not escape from the worst and 
the worst nestled cosily beside the better. The yards, front and back, 
were narrow; some were trash dumps, some had flower gardens. Behind 
were privies, for there was no sewage system.   After looking 
about a bit, Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom, across the river 
and far removed from the white city, a considerable tract of land, 
and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might 
gradually be moved to this plot. He talked about it to the Presiding 
Elder. The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully. 
He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand. But there was one 
thing that he had to stress, and that was that the contribution to the 
general church expenses, the dollar money, had been seriously falling 
behind in this church, and that must be looked after immediately. In 
fact, he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had 
been sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar money.

Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was, they must have a 
better church, a more business-like conduct of the church organization, 
and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship 
into a modern church organization. He emphasized to the Presiding 
Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the 
river. The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible. 
But he told Wilson to "go ahead and try". And Wilson tried.

It did seem impossible. The bank which held the mortgage on the 
old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears, and 
the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was 
being held for an eventual development for white working people who 
were coming in, and that none would be sold to colored folk. When it 
was proposed to rebuild the church, Wilson found that the terms for 
a new mortgage were very high. He was sure that he could do better if 
he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed.   But when this proposal 
was made to his Deacon Board, he met unanimous opposition. The 
church certainly would not be removed. The very proposition was sacrilege. 
It had been here fifty years. It was going to stay forever. 
It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject. As for 
rebuilding, well, that might be looked into, but there was no hurry, no 
hurry at all.   Wilson again went downtown to a different banker, 
an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic, but 
he shook his head.   "Reverend", he said, "I think you don't 
quite understand the situation here. Don't you see the amount 
of money that has been invested by whites around that church? Tenements, 
stores, saloons, some gambling, I hope not too much. The colored 
people are getting employment at Kent House and other places, and 
they are near their places of employment. When a city has arranged 
things like this you cannot easily change them. Now, if I were you I 
would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or 
ten years. By that time, perhaps something better can be done".

Then Wilson asked, "What about this Kent House which you 
mention? I don't understand why a white hotel should be down here".

The young banker looked at him with a certain surprise, and 
then he said flatly: "I'm afraid I can't tell you anything 
in particular about Kent House. You'll have to find out about it 
on your own. Hope to see you again". And he dismissed the colored 
pastor.   It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside 
him and took his hand. She said, "My dear, do you know what Kent 
House is"?   "No", said Wilson, "I don't. I was 
just asking about it. What is it"?   "It's a house of prostitution 
for white men with white girls as inmates. They hire 
a good deal of local labor, including two members of our Trustee Board. 
They buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized 
by some of the best white gentlemen in town".  Wilson stared 
at her. "My dear, you must be mistaken".   "Talk to 
Mrs& Catt", she said.   And after Wilson had talked to Mrs& 
Catt and to others, he was absolutely amazed. This, of course, was 
the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities- putting 
white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods 
and carrying them on openly. But it had largely disappeared on 
account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the 
part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages.

But this situation of Kent House was more subtle. The wages 
involved were larger and more regular. The inmates were white and 
from out of town, avoiding local friction. The backing from the white 
town was greater and there was little publicity. Good wages, patronage 
and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes. 
And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go. And 
for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean 
practically the end of his career in the Methodist church, if not 
in all churches. 
Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold. 
There was a fog, which increased the darkness of the night. Two gas 
lamps were no more than a misleading glow. He might have been anywhere 
or nowhere.   The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription 
from Dr& Verdi. Secretary of State Seward was a sick man. 
The idea had come from Herold, who had once been a chemist's clerk. 
The sick were always receiving medicines. No one would question 
such an errand. The bottle was filled up with flour.   Before Payne 
loomed the Old Clubhouse, Seward's home, where Key had once 
been killed. Now it would have another death. From the outside it 
was an ordinary enough house of the gentry. He clomped heavily up the 
stoop and rang the bell. Like the bell at Mass, the doorbell was pitched 
too high. It was still Good Friday, after all.   A nigger 
boy opened the door. Payne did not notice him. He was thinking chiefly 
of Cap. If their schedules were to synchronize, there was no point 
in wasting time. He pushed his way inside.   For a moment 
the hall confused him. This was the largest house he had ever been in, 
almost the largest building, except for a hotel. He had no idea where 
Seward's room would be. In the half darkness the banisters gleamed, 
and the hall seemed enormous. Above him somewhere were the bedrooms. 
Seward would be up there.   He explained his errand, but without 
bothering much to make it plausible, for he felt something well 
up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army. He did not 
really want to kill, but as in the sexual act, there was a moment when 
the impulse took over and could not be downed, even while you watched 
yourself giving way to it. He was no longer worried. Everything would 
be all right. He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped.

Still, the sensation always surprised him. It was a thrill he 
felt no part in. He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while 
his body did these quick, appalling, and efficient things.   He 
brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs. They 
were carpeted, but made for pumps and congress gaiters, not the great 
clodhoppers he wore. The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled 
drum.   At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there 
angrily in a dressing gown. He stopped and whispered his errand. 
Young Frederick Seward held out his hand. Panting a little, Payne 
shook his head. Dr& Verdi had told him to deliver his package in 
person.   Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping, and then 
went through a pantomime at his father's door, to prove the statement.

"Very well", Payne said. "I will go". He smiled, 
but now that he knew where the elder Seward was, he did not intend 
to go. He pulled out his pistol and fired it. It made no sound. It 
had misfired. Reversing it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick 
Seward's head, over and over again.   It was the first blow 
that was always difficult. After that, violence was exultantly easy. 
He got caught up into it and became a different person. Only afterwards 
did an act like that become meaningless, so that he would puzzle over 
it for days, whereas at the time it had seemed quite real. 
The nigger boy fled down the stairs, screaming, "Murder". 
It was not murder at all. Payne was more methodical than that. He 
was merely clearing a way to what he had to do.   He ran for the 
sick room, found his pistol was broken, and threw it away. A knife would 
do. From childhood he had known all about knives. Someone blocked 
the door from inside. He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness. 
He saw only dimly moving figures, but when he slashed them they yelled 
and fled. He went for the bed, jumped on it, and struck where he could, 
repeatedly. It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares 
to punish one's dreams.   Two men pulled him off. Nobody 
said anything. Payne hacked at their arms. There was a lady there, in 
a nightdress. He would not have wanted to hurt a lady. Another man 
approached, this one fully dressed. When the knife went into his chest, 
he went down at once.   "I'm mad", shouted Payne, as 
he ran out into the hall. "I'm mad", and only wished he had been. 
That would have made things so much easier. But he was not mad. He 
was only dreaming.   He clattered down the stairs and out of 
the door. Somewhere in the fog, the nigger boy was still yelling murder. 
One always wakes up, even from one's own dreams. The clammy air 
revived him. Herold, he saw, had fled.   Well, one did not expect 
much of people like Herold.   He unhitched his horse, walked 
it away, mounted, and spurred it on. The nigger boy was close 
behind him. Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone. He rode 
on and on. He had no idea where he was. After some time he came to 
an open field. An open field was better than a building, that was for 
sure, so he dismounted, turned off the horse, and plunged through the 
grass.   He felt curiously sleepy, the world seemed far away; 
he knew he should get to Cap, but he didn't know how. He was sure, 
for he had done as he was told, hadn't he? Cap would find him 
and take care of him. So choosing a good tree, he clambered up into it, 
found a comfortable notch, and curled up in it to sleep, like the tousled 
bear he was, with his hands across his chest, as though surfeited 
with honey.   Violence always made him tired, but he was not 
frightened. ##

In Boston, Edwin Booth was winding up a performance 
of <A New Way to Pay Old Debts>. It was a part so familiar 
to him that he did not bother to think about it any more. Acting soothed 
him. On a stage he always knew what to do, and tonight, to judge 
by the applause, he must be doing it better than usual.   As 
Sir Giles Overreach (how often had he had to play that part, who did 
not believe a word of it), he raised his arm and declaimed: "Where 
is my honour now"?   That was one of the high spots of the 
play. The audience, as usual, loved it. He was delighted to see them 
so happy. If he had any worries, it was only the small ones, about 
Mother in New York, and his daughter Edwina and what she might be 
doing at this hour, with her Aunt Asia, in Philadelphia.   Everyone 
is ambivalent about his profession, if he has practised it long 
enough, but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all 
those unseen people out there, who might cheer you or boo you, but that 
was largely, though not entirely, up to you.   They made the 
world seem friendly somehow, though he knew it was not. #/7,#

Wilkes 
was quite right about one thing. Laura Keene had been in the 
green room. The commotion had brought her into the wings. Since she 
could not act, one part suited her as well as any other, and so she was 
the first person to offer Mr& Lincoln a glass of water, holding 
it 
up to the box, high above her head, to Miss Harris, who had asked for 
it.   She had been one of the first to collect her wits.

It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience, as that 
they had been stunned already. Most of them had seen <Our American 
Cousin> before, and unless Miss Keene was on stage, there was not 
much to it. The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom.

The stage had been empty, except for Harry Hawk, doing his star 
monologue. The audience was fond of Harry Hawk, he was a dear, 
in or out of character, but he was not particularly funny. At the end 
of the monologue the audience would applaud. Meanwhile it looked at 
the scenery.   "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside 
out, you sockdologizing old mantrap"! said Trenchard, otherwise 
Hawk. There was always a pause here, before the next line. 
That was when the gun went off. Yet even that explosion did not mean 
much. Guns were going off all over Washington City these days, because 
of the celebrations, and the theatre was not soundproof.   Then 
the audience saw a small, dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential 
box. "<Sic semper tyrannis>", it said mildly. Booth 
had delivered his line. Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud 
of smoke.   They strained forward. They had not heard what had 
been said. They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily. 
The figure leapt from the box, almost lost its balance, the flag 
draped there tore in the air, the figure landed on its left leg, fell 
on its hands, and pressed itself up.   Harry Hawk still had his 
arm raised towards the wings. His speech faltered. He did not lower 
his arm.   The figure was so theatrically dressed, that it was 
as though 
a character from some other play had blundered into this one. The 
play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of <The Octoroon>. 
This figure looked like the slave dealer from that. But it 
also looked like a toad, hopping away from the light. There was something 
maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.   Then 
it disappeared into the wings.   Harry Hawk had not shifted 
position, but he at last lowered his arm.   Mrs& Lincoln screamed. 
There was no mistaking that scream. It was what anyone who had ever 
seen her had always expected her to do. Yet this scream had a different 
note in it. That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them 
awake like a pail of water.   Clara Harris, one of the guests 
in the box, stood up and demanded water. Her action was involuntary. 
When something unexpected happened, one always asked for water if 
one were a woman, brandy if one were a man.   Mrs& lincoln screamed 
again.   In the Presidential box someone leaned over the 
balustrade and yelled: "He has shot the President"!   That 
got everybody up. On the stage, Harry Hawk began to weep. Laura 
Keene 
brushed by him with the glass of water. The crowd began to move. 
In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of plots, and one death 
might attract another. It was not exactly panic they gave way to, 
but they could not just sit there. The beehive voices, for no one could 
bear silence, drowned out the sound of Mrs& Lincoln's weeping.

At the rear of the auditorium, upstairs, some men tried to 
push open the door to the box corridor. It would not give.   A 
Dr& Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to 
hoist him up to the box. In the audience a man named Ferguson lost 
his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob, on the same principle 
which had led Miss Harris to demand water.   Someone 
opened the corridor door from the inside, and called for a doctor. Somehow 
Dr& Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out 
into the dingy corridor. He went straight to the Presidential box.

As usual, Mrs& Lincoln had lost her head, but nobody blamed 
her for doing so now. There was a little blood on the hem of her dress, 
for the assassin had slashed Miss Harris's companion, Major 
Rathbone, with a knife. Rathbone said he was bleeding to death. By 
the look of him he wasn't that far gone. 
With a sneer, the man spread his legs and, a third time, confronted them.

Once more, Katie reared, and whinnied in fear. For a moment, 
boy and mount hung in midair. Stevie twisted and, frantically, 
commanded the mare to leap straight ahead. But the stranger was nimbler 
still. With a bold arm, he dared once more to obstruct them. Katie 
reared a third time, then, trembling, descended.   The stranger 
leered. Seizing the bridle, he tugged with all his might and forced 
Katie to her knees. It was absurd. Stevie could feel himself toppling. 
He saw the ground coming up- and the stranger's head. With 
incredible ferocity, he brought his fists together and struck. The blow 
encountered silky hair and hard bone. The man uttered a weird cry, 
spun about, and collapsed in the sand.   Katie scrambled to her 
feet, Stevie agilely retaining his seat. Again Katie reared, and now, 
wickedly, he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again 
upon the sprawled figure of the stranger. He could feel his own feet, 
iron-shod, striking repeatedly until the body was limp. He gloated, 
and his lips slavered. He heard himself chortling.   They rode 
around and around to trample the figure into the sand. Only the top 
of the head, with a spot bare and white as a clamshell, remained visible. 
Stevie was shouting triumphantly.   A train hooted. Instantly, 
he chilled. They were pursuing him. He was frightened; his fists 
clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt. Then Katie stumbled, 
and again he was falling, falling!   "Stevie! Stevie"!

His mother was nudging him, but he was still falling. His head hung 
over the boards of Katie's stall; before it was sprawled the 
mangled corpse of the bearded stranger.   "Stevie, wake up now! 
We're nearly there".   He had been dreaming. He was safe 
in his Mama's arms.   The train had slowed. Houses winked 
as the cars rolled beside a little depot. "Po' Chavis"! the 
trainman 
called. He came by and repeated, "Po' Chavis"! 

#CHAPTER 
6#

<Bong! Bong!> startled him awake. The room vibrated as 
if a giant hand had rocked it. <Bong!> a dull boom and a throbbing 
echo. The walls bulged, the floor trembled, the windowpanes rattled. 
He stared at the far morning, expecting a pendulum to swing across the 
horizon. <Bong!> He raced to the window and yanked at the sash. 
<Bong!> the wood was old, the paint alligatored. <Bong!> A 
fresh breeze saluted him. <Six> o'clock!   He put his his 
head out. There was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the 
red brick walls like a green-scaled monster. The clock which had struck 
presented an innocent face.   In the kitchen Mama was wiping 
the cupboards.   "There's a tower and a steeple on the church 
a million feet high. And the loudest clock in the whole world"!

"I know, Stephen", she smiled. "They say that our 
steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high. The clock you heard strike- 
it's really the town clock- was installed last April by 
Mrs& Shorter, on her birthday".   He dressed, and sped outdoors. 
He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square. The steeple leaned 
backward, while the church advanced like a headless creature in a 
long, shapeless coat. The spire seemed to hold up the sky.   Port 
Jervis, basking in the foothills, was the city of God. The Dutch 
Reformed Church, with two steeples and its own school was on Main 
Street; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street; 
the Catholic Saint Mary's Church, with an even taller steeple 
and a cross on top, stood on Ball Street. The Catholics had the 
largest cemetery, near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south; 
Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds.   God 
was everywhere, in the belfry, in the steeple, in the clouds, in the 
trees, and in the mountains hulking on the horizon. Somewhere, beyond, 
where shadows lurked, must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached 
and the dreadful Lake of Fire.   So, walking in awe, he became 
familiar with God, who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church 
with its high steeple and clock. There was no church like Drew Church, 
no preacher like Papa, who was intimate with Him, and could consign 
sinners to hellfire. To know God he must follow in Papa's 
footsteps. He was fortunate, and proud.   The veterans, idling 
on their benches in the Square, beneath the soldiers' monument, got 
to 
their feet when Papa approached: "Morning, Reverend"! His 
being and His will- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa- 
illumined every parish face, turned the choir into a band of angels, 
and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven.   "We have nine 
hundred and eleven members in our charge", Mama announced, "and three 
hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars".   When Papa 
went out to do God's work, Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy, 
which was drawn by Violet, the new black mare. Although they journeyed 
westerly as far as Germantown, beyond the Erie roundhouse and 
the machine shop, and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and northward 
to Brooklyn, below Point Peter, he could see the church spire 
wherever he looked back. Sometimes they went south and rolled past 
the tollhouse- "Afternoon, Reverend"!- and crossed the suspension 
bridge to Matamoras; that was Pennsylvania.   In the 
Delaware River, three long islands were overgrown with greening trees 
and underbrush. South of Laurel Grove Cemetery, and below the 
junction of the Neversink and the Delaware, was the Tri-State Rock, 
from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well 
as New York, simply by spinning around on his heel.   On these 
excursions, Papa instructed him on man's chief end, which was his 
duty to God and his own salvation. However, a boy's lively eyes might 
rove. Where Cuddleback Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent 
swimming hole. Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing 
youth: "Idle recreation"! Stevie saw no idols; it troubled 
him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw. He was torn between 
the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging 
northward on the Monticello Branch.   "Where you been 
today"? Ludie inquired every evening, pretending that he did not 
care. "He'll make a preacher out of you"!   "No, he 
won't"! Stevie flared. "Not me"!   "Somebody's 
got to be a preacher in the family. He made a will and last testament 
before we left Paterson. I heard them! Uncle and Aunt Howe were 
the witnesses".   "Will he die"?   "Everybody 
does".   Ludie could be hateful. To speak of Papa dying was 
a sin. It could never happen as long as God was alert and the Drew 
steeple stood guard with its peaked lance.   Stevie was constantly 
slipping into the church. He pulled with all his strength at the 
heavy, brass-bound door, and shuffled along the wainscoted wall. The 
cold, mysterious presence of God was all around him. At the end of a 
shaft of light, the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon. 
Far away, standing before a curtained window in the study room, was 
his father, hands tucked under his coattails, and staring into the dark 
church. The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence.

The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles 
and gray hair. Would Papa really die? The mouth was thin-lipped 
and wide, the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide. When Papa's 
slender fingers removed the spectacles, there were red indentations 
on the bridge of the strong nose.   "It's time you began 
to think on God, Stephen. Perhaps one day He will choose you as 
He chose me, long ago. Therefore, give Him your affection and store 
up His love for you. Open your heart to Him and pray, Stephen, pray! 
For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal 
punishment in the Lake of Fire".   Stevie had heard these 
words many times, yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble. 
For he feared the Lake of Fire. He strove to think of God and His 
eternal wrath; he must pray to be spared.   Papa was disappointed 
that none of the brothers had heard the Call. Not George, Townley, 
or Ted, certainly not Ludie. Burt was at Hackettstown and 
Will at Albany Law School, where they surely could not hear it. Someday 
God would choose <him>. He would hear the Call and would run 
to tell Papa. The stern face would relax, the black-clad arms would 
embrace him, "My son"! Yet how might he know the Call when 
it came? Probably, as in Scriptures, a still, small voice would whisper. 
It would summon him once; if he missed it, never again. What 
if it came when he was playing, or was asleep and dreaming?

He must not fail to hear it. He was Papa's chosen; therefore, 
nothing but good could happen to him, even in God's wrathful storms. 
When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley, he 
was unafraid. Aggie might fly into a closet, shut the door and bury her 
head in the clothes; he dared to wait for the lightning.   Lightning 
could strike you blind if you were a sinner! But he was good. 
He clenched his fists and faced the terror. Thunder crashed; 
barrels tumbled down the mountainsides, and bounced and bounced till their 
own fury split them open. Lightning might strike the steeples of 
the other churches; not of Drew Church. A flash illumined the trees 
as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions. Violet whinnied 
from the stable.   He ran out into the downpour, sped across the 
yard and into the buggy room. "Don't be afraid, Violet"! he 
shouted, and was aghast at the echoes. "Don't you be afraid"! 
He would save her. If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama 
first and Violet next. Drenched and shaking, he stood near the sweet-smelling 
stall and dared to pat her muzzle. "Don't you be afraid, 
Violet"!   After the storm, the sky cleared blue and cool, 
and fragrant air swept the hills. When the sun came out, Stevie 
strode proudly into Orange Square, smiling like a landlord on industrious 
tenants. The fountain had brimmed over, the cannon were wet, the 
soldiers' monument glistened. Even before the benches had dried, 
the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places. The great 
spire shone as if the lightning had polished it. He jumped. The 
pointed shadow had nearly touched him.   He trailed Ludie to the 
baseball game in the lot on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed.

"Go on home"! Ludie screeched at him. "Someone'll 
tell Papa"!   No one told on Ludie, not even when he 
slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box. Ludie did as he pleased.

Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot 
at 
crows. Ludie chewed roofer's tar. Ludie had a cigar box full of 
marbles and shooters, and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July. 
Ludie hopped rides on freight cars, and was chased by Mr& Yankton, 
the railroad guard. He came home overheated, ran straight to the ice-chest, 
and gulped shivery cold water.   Stevie envied him. That 
Ludie! He, too, cocked his cap at a jaunty angle, jingled marbles 
in his pocket, and swaggered down Main Street. On the Christophers' 
lawn, little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at 
a tea party. A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his 
size. Stevie yearned for a dog. He wondered whether God had a dog in 
the sky.   He meandered down Pike Street, past the First National 
Bank with its green window shades. He crossed the tracks to 
Delaware House, where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters 
and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah. A tall lady, with a ruffled 
collar very low on her bosom, turned insolent green eyes upon him. She 
was taller than Aggie. She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth 
and haughty air that she had to be wicked. Fiddles screeched; a piano 
tinkled.   "P& J&"- as Ludie called the town- was 
crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the 
heat in the big cities. They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses, or 
at private homes. Rich people went to Delaware House, Opera House, 
American House or Fowler House. 
<If the crummy bastard could write!> That's how it should be. 
<It's those two fucken niggers! Krist, I wish they could write!> 
Nigger pussy. He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy. <Oh, 
sweet 
land of heaven, haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy!> 
He thought of her, the first one. He had caught her coming out of the 
shack. She was a juicy one. <Oh how they bounced!> Fresh, warm, 
sweet and juicy, sweet lovin sixteen, she was. <Man how I love 
nigger pussy!> The snow came a little faster now, he noted. He thought 
of Joe Harris, the nigger who had gone after his sister. He chuckled, 
the memory vivid. <Jee- sus, We Fixed him! Yooee, we 
fixed him!> The snow again. <If only the fucken weather wasn't 
so lousy! Goddamn niggers, Lord. What I have to put up with! 
Sonuvabitch, I can't figure out what in hell for they went and put 
niggers in my squad for. Only one worth a shit, and that's Brandon. 
He ain't so bad> **h   His thoughts turned to other things 
**h The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those 
others done for. <Kaboom for>.   He had been pretty scared 
himself, wondering what the hell was coming off. But he soon saw which 
way the ball was bouncing. Soon came back to his senses. "I soon 
came back to my senses", he said, aloud, to the young blizzard, proudly, 
drawing himself up, as if making a report to some important superior 
**h <I was the first to get my squad on the ball, and anybody 
thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb. Look at thum. That goddamn 
redheader was the worst. He kept sayin, not me, not me, I don't wanta 
wind up like em. But I told him, goddammit>. "I told him", 
he said aloud **h <They'll get the guys that done it. That'll 
put the place back to normal>. Normal, <by God. Maybe it's a good 
thing it happened. Maybe they'll stop it now, once for all. Clean 
the place up. They're doin it now. I hear the whole bunch is croakin 
out in the snow>. They'll get the guys that done it **h There 
was something troubling him though: as yet <they hadn't> **h 
Five days **h <Keerist> **h Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through 
him. His eyes blinked hard, snapping on and squashing some bad things 
that were 
trying to push their way into him. A tune began to whirl 
inside his head. One of his favorites: "Guitar Boogie". It 
always came on, faithfully, just like a radio or juke box, whenever he 
started to worry too much about something, when the bad things tried 
to push their way into him. The music drove them off, or away, and he 
was free to walk on air in a very few moments, humming and jiving within, 
beating the rhythm within. He glowed with anticipation about what 
would happen to the culprits when they caught them **h <Turn the 
bastards over to me- to me and my boys- no nigger ever got what would 
be comin to them>- reactionary bastards **h. He had never heard 
the word reactionary before his life as a ~POW began. It was 
a word he was proud of, a word that meant much to him, and he used it 
with great pleasure, almost as if it were an exclusive possession, and 
more: he sensed himself to be very highly educated, four cuts above 
any of the folks back home **h "<Four cuts at least>", he chuckled 
to himself, "<and I owe it all to them>". The word also 
made him feel hate, sincere hate, for those so labeled. He used it very 
effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball. It came up 
again and again in the discussion sessions **h <Lousy Reactionary 
bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months. Months. Hired, 
hard lackeys of the Warmongering Capitalists. Not captured, sent 
here. To fuck up the Program. You guys remember that. Remember that> 
**h He heard himself haranguing them. He saw himself before them 
delivering the speech. He laughed, suddenly, feeling a surge of power 
telling him of his hold over them, seeing himself before them, receiving 
utmost respect and attention. One day, Ching had told him (smiling, 
patting him on the back) as they walked to the weekly conference 
of squad leaders, "Keep it up, your squad is good, one of the best, 
keep it up, keep up the good work". He would! That was really 
something, coming from Ching **h "Really something", he said, aloud 
**h <Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and 
bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards>. "They'll 
get them by God and let them bring them down here to me, just let them, 
God I'll slice their balls right off **h" His arm moved swiftly, 
violently, once, twice. He felt intense satisfaction. He was 
tingling within. Before him, mutilated, bleeding to death, they lay. 
It was as if it had been done. "Bastards", he said aloud, spitting 
on them. He halted, and looked around. Rivers of cold sweat were 
suddenly unleashed within him. The thought came back, the one nagging 
at him these past four days. He tried to stifle it. But the words were 
forming. He knew he couldn't. He braced himself **h <Somebody'll 
hafta start thinkin> **h He fought it, seeking to kill the last 
few words, but on they came **h <bout takin>- <his> **h He was 
trembling, a strange feeling upon him, fully expecting some catastrophe 
to strike him dead on the spot. But it didn't. And he took heart; 
the final word came forth **h <place> **h Now he heard it, fully: 
"**h <bout takin his place> **h" He listened, waited, nothing 
happened. He felt good. His old self. The music arrived, taking 
him **h its rhythm stroked him, snaked all through him, the lyrics 
lifted him, took him from one magic isle to another, stopping briefly 
at each **h <Brandon. He is good. Damn good. But a nigger. Johnson. 
Jesus, the guy says he is trying. But he isn't with it, not 
at all with it. When I talked to Ching about it, he said, Everyone 
can learn, if he is not a Reactionary or lazy. No one is stupid. That's 
what he said. He oughta know. It is plain as hell Johnson is 
no Reactionary. So you're not tryin, Johnson, you bastard you> 
**h He looked over at him, lying there, asleep, and he felt a wave of 
revulsion. How he loathed him. Sleepy-eyed, soft-spoken Johnson **h 
<Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad> **h He was 
the guy what always goofed at Question Time **h <Why couldn't they 
have dumped him off on someone else? Why me? Why didn't the 
damn Reactionaries bump him off? Why Slater?> **h Like a particle 
drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard 
in his mind. The music surged up, but it failed to check it. <Who 
is the man to take His place? The guy with most on the Ball>. Most 
on the Ball. <Handle men. Thoroughly Wised Up. Knows the score> 
**h With a supreme effort, he broke it off. He turned to the 
window again. A gnawing and gnashing within him. The snow was tumbling 
down furiously now. Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground, piling higher 
and higher. He stared at it, amazed, alarmed **h <The whole fucken 
sky's cavin in! Keeeerist! Lookit it! Cover the whole 
building, bury us all, by nightfall. Jesus! **h Somebody, got to be 
somebody **h If I don't put my two cents in soon, somebody else 
will **h I know they're waitin only for one thing: for the bastards 
what done it to be nailed. Maybe they already got them>. He was 
again tingling with pleasure, seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes. 
<Top dog, sleeping and eating right there with the Staff. Ching, 
Tien, all of them **h Top dog **h Poor ol Slater **h Jesus, imagine, 
the crummy bastards, they'll get em, they'll get what's 
comin to em> **h He whirled about suddenly. It was nothing, though 
his heart was thumping wildly. Somebody was up. That was all. 
"Boy, you're stirrin early", a sleepy voice said.   "Yehhh", 
said Coughlin, testily, eyeing him up and down.   "Lookit 
that come down, willya", said the man, scratching himself, yawning.

"Yehhh", said Coughlin, practically spitting on him.

The man moved away.   <That's the way. They'll toe 
the line. Goddamn it. Keep the chatter to a minimum, short answers, 
one word, if possible. Less bull the more you can do with um. That's 
Brown's trouble. All he does is to bullshit with his squad, 
and they are the stupidest bastards around. Just about to get their asses 
kicked into hut Seven. Plenty of room there now. All those dumb 
8-Balls croaked. You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you 
know how. Anything. They'd cut their mothers' belly open. Give 
um the works. See,> he's <already snapping it up, the dumb jerk> 
**h Coughlin grinned, feeling supremely on top of things **h He watched 
the snow once again. It infuriated him. It made no sense to him 
**h He whirled around, suddenly hot all over, finding the man who had 
been standing before him a few moments back, nailing him to the spot 
on which he now stood, open-mouthed-   "You- Listen!- 
name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism. 
Quick- Quick- NOW"!   The man shrank before 
the hot fury, searching frantically for the answer **h   Finnegan 
woke up. There was a hell of a noise this time of morning. He stared 
out the window. <For Christ's sake! The whole fucken sky's 
caved in!> He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened 
him **h It was that prick Coughlin. What the hell was he up 
to now? Why didn't he drop dead? How did they miss him when they 
got Slater? <How?> **h Then he was asking himself the usual 
early morning questions: <What the Hell am I doin here? Is 
this a nut-house? Am I nuts? Is this for real? Am I dreamin?> 
**h   From somewhere in the hut came Coughlin's voice.

"How long did you study? How long, buddy"?   "For 
Christ's sake"! a voice pleaded.   "Don't Christsake 
me, buddy! Just answer. C'mon- <c'mon!>" 
**h <I'm no hero. Did I start the damn war? **h Automatically, 
Finnegan started going over today's lesson **h Capitalism rots from 
the core. Did I start the damn war? Who did? That's a good 
one. I thought I knew. Why don't Uncle Sam mind his own fucken 
business? I'll bet both together did. I bet. So fuck them both. 
Goddamn. Goddammit. Just let me go home to Jersey, back to the 
shore, oh, Jesus, the shore. The waves breakin in on you and your girl 
at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight even Jesus sweet 
Mary. If I hafta do this to stay alive by God I'll do it. I 
hated the goddamn army from the first day I got in anyhow. All pricks 
like Coughlin run it anyway, one way or another. Fuck them> **h He 
rolled over and tried to shut out the noise, now much louder. He snuggled 
into the blanket **h ##

Brandon dreamed. <He was sitting 
on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water. A 
river, wide as the Missouri, where it ran by his place. The log was 
spinning. But he was not>. So what? Why should I be spinning just 
because the goddamn log is spinning? (he asked this out loud, but 
no one heard it over the other noise in the hut). <Over on the bank, 
the west bank, a man stood, calling to him. He couldn't make out 
what he was saying. No doubt it had to do with the log. Why should 
he be concerned>?

Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that 
he should burn his books, too. But while the two men are riding into 
the country, where they are going to dinner, they are attacked in 
the dark of the forest by a band of thieves, who strip them of everything, 
including most of their clothes.   "You must be a very learned 
man", says Voltaire to one of the bandits.   "A learned 
man"? the bandit laughs in his face.   But Voltaire perseveres. 
He goes to the chief himself. "At what university did you 
study"? he asks. He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never 
attended a higher institution. "To have become so corrupt", he 
says, "surely you must have studied many arts and sciences".

The chief, annoyed by these questions, knocks Voltaire down and shouts 
at him that he not only never went to any school, but never even 
learned how to read.   When finally the two bedraggled men reach 
their friend's home, Voltaire's fears are once again aroused. 
For it is such a distinguished place, with such fine works of art and 
such a big library, that there can be little doubt but that the owner 
has become depraved by all this culture.   To Voltaire's surprise, 
however, their host gives them fresh clothes to put on, opens his 
purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner.

Immediately after dinner, however, Rousseau asks for still another 
favor. Could he have pen and paper, please? He is in a hurry 
to write another essay against culture.   Such was the impromptu 
that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans Souci and that was 
soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe, 
to be printed sometime later, but with the name of Timon of Athens, 
the famous misanthrope, substituted for that of Rousseau. 
How cruel!   But at the same time how understandable. How could 
the rich, for whom life was made so simple, ever understand the subterfuges, 
the lies, the frauds, the errors, sins and even crimes to 
which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages 
the rich had in the race of life?   How, for example, 
could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau 
would find himself when, soon after the furor of his first <Discourse,> 
he acquired still another title to fame?   This time 
as a musician. As a composer.   Ever since he had first begun 
to study music and to teach it, Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through 
to fame as the result of a successful opera. But his facility in 
this genre was not great. And his efforts to get a performance for his 
<Gallant Muses> invariably failed. And for good reasons. His 
operatic music had little merit.   But then one day, while on a 
week's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler, Rousseau 
amused the company with a few little melodies he had written, to which 
he attached no great importance. He was really amazed to discover 
the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs.

"Put a few such songs together", they urged him. "String them 
onto some sort of little plot, and you'll have a delightful operetta".

He didn't believe them. "Nonsense", he said. "This 
is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away"!   "Heaven 
forbid"! cried the ladies, enchanted by his music. "You 
must make an opera out of this material".   And they wouldn't 
leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised.   Oh, 
the irony and the bitterness of it! That after all his years of effort 
to become a composer, he should now, now when he was still stoutly 
replying to the critics of his <Discourse on the Arts and Sciences,> 
be so close to a success in music and have to reject it. 
Or at least appear to reject it!   But what else could he do? 
You couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time 
practice them, could you? Well, yes, perhaps in literature, since 
you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against 
literature and so were involved in spite of yourself. But now music 
too? No. That would be too much!   And the fault, of 
course, was Rameau's. The fault was Rameau's and that of the whole 
culture of this Parisian age. For it was Rameau's type of music 
that he had been trying to write, and that he couldn't write. These 
little songs, however, were sweet nothings from the heart, tender 
memories of his childhood, little melodies that anyone could hum and 
that would make one want to weep.   But no. He couldn't appear 
as a composer now. That glory, craved for so long, was now forbidden 
to him. Still, just for the ladies, and just for this once, for this 
one weekend in the country, he would make a little piece out of his 
melodies.   The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded. 
And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.

But then, after the little operetta had been given its feeble 
amateur rendering, everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost 
forever, and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript 
in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited.

Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite, standing 
there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance. 
The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him. 
A contradiction? Bah, what was a contradiction in one's life? 
Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes, 
and saying yes when she meant no.   Rousseau had to admit that 
though he couldn't agree to a public performance, he would indeed, 
just for his own private satisfaction, dearly love to know how his work 
would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices.

"I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people 
seem to think", he said.   Duclos, the historian, pointed 
out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible. The musicians of the 
Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound. 
Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.   Rousseau agreed. 
But he recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance 
of his opera <Armide,> behind closed doors, just for himself alone.

Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau: that the writer 
of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the 
writer of an amusing little operetta. That would certainly be paradoxical. 
But Duclos thought he saw a way out.   "Let me do the 
submitting to the Royal Academy", he suggested. "Your name will 
never appear. No one will even suspect that it is your work".

To that Rousseau could agree.   But now what crazy twists 
and turns of his emotions!   Afraid at one and the same time 
that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride 
even though no one knew he was the author- and that the work would 
be accepted, and then that his violent feelings in the matter would 
certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself. And 
how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! And thus torn 
between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera 
and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity, 
Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks.   All these 
emotions were screwed up to new heights when, after acceptance and 
the first rehearsals, there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian 
music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to 
inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King's 
amusements, and that he was now demanding that the work be offered 
first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau. Imagine the honor 
of it!   "What was your answer"? Jean Jacques asked, 
striving to appear unimpressed.   "I refused", Duclos said. 
"What else could I do? Monsieur de Cury was incensed, of course. 
But I said I would first have to get the author's permission. 
And I was certain he would refuse".   How infuriating all 
this was! Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged 
into his <Discourse,> and before he had committed himself to a life 
of austerity and denial? Now, when everything was opening up to 
him- even the court of Louis /15,!- he had to play a role of 
self-effacement.   Back and forth Duclos had to go, between M& 
de Cury and Jean Jacques and between the Duke d'Aumont and Jean 
Jacques again, as his little operetta, <The Village Soothsayer,> 
though still unperformed, took on ever more importance.   And 
of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get 
around among his closest friends. But they, naturally, kept his secret 
well, and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical 
and court circles.   How titillating it was to go among people 
who did not know him as the composer, but who talked in the most 
glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first 
rehearsals. The furor was such that people who could not possibly have 
squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were 
intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational. And 
listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of 
chocolate in a cafe, Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration, 
trembling lest his authorship become known, and at the same time dreaming 
of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself 
suddenly as the composer.   He felt himself now, as he himself 
says in his <Confessions,> at a crucial point of his life. And that 
was why, on the day of the performance, when a carriage from the royal 
stables called to take him to the palace, he did not bother to shave. 
On the contrary, he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of 
several days.   Seeing him in that condition, and about to enter 
the hall where the King, the Queen, the whole royal family and all 
the members of the highest aristocracy would be present, Grimm and the 
Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him.   "You can't 
go in that way"! they cried.   "Why not"? Jean Jacques 
asked. "Who is going to stop me"?   "You haven't dressed 
for the occasion"! they pointed out to him.   "I'm 
dressed as I always am", Rousseau said. "Neither better nor worse".

"At home, yes", they argued. "But here you are 
in the palace. There's the King. And Madame de Pompadour".

"If they are here, then surely I have the right to be here", 
Rousseau said. "And even more right. Since I am the composer"!

"But in such a slovenly condition".   "What 
is slovenly about me"? Rousseau asked. "Is it because of my slovenliness 
that hair grows on my face? Surely it would grow there 
whether 
I washed myself or not. A hundred years ago I would have worn 
a beard with pride. And those without beards would have stood out as 
not dressed for the occasion. Now times have changed, and I must pretend 
that hair doesn't grow on my face. That's the fashion. And 
fashion is the real king here. Not Louis /15,, since even he obeys. 
Now, if you don't mind, I should like to hear my own piece performed".

But of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold 
at all. He trembled lest his piece should fail. And this in addition 
to his usual fear of being among people of high society. His fear 
of making some inane or inappropriate remark. And even deeper than 
that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to 
relieve himself. Could he walk out in the midst of his piece? Here, 
before the court? Before the King? 
It was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began. 
##

The rider from Concord was as good as his word. He came spurring 
and whooping down the road, his horse kicking up clouds of dust, 
shouting:   "They're a-coming! By God, they're a-coming, 
they are"!   We heard him before he ever showed, and we 
heard him yelling after he was out of sight. Solomon Chandler hadn't 
misjudged the strength of his lungs, not at all. I think you could 
have heard him a mile away, and he was bursting at every seam with 
importance. I have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole 
character of a man, and when a very small man is up on a saddle, he'd 
like as not prefer to eat his meals there. That's understandable, 
and I appreciate the sentiment. As for this rider, I never saw 
him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted, so whether he stood 
tall or short in his shoes, I can't say; but I do know that 
he gave the day tone and distinction. The last thing in the world that 
resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics 
perched on top of a stone wall, and this dashing rider made us feel 
a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation.   We came 
down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us, and we crouched behind 
it. I have heard people talk with contempt about the British regulars, 
but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of 
which they are deplorably ignorant. Whatever we felt about the redcoats, 
we respected them in terms of their trade, which was killing; and 
I know that I, myself, was nauseated with apprehension and fear and 
that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun. I wanted to wipe 
my flint, but I didn't dare to, the state my hands were in, just 
as I didn't dare to do anything about the priming. The gun would 
fire or not, just as chance willed. I put a lot more trust in my two 
legs than in the gun, because the most important thing I had learned 
about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it.

The gunfire, which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the 
road now, stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that 
brief 
interval, a redcoat officer came tearing down the road, whipping 
his horse fit to kill. I don't know whether he was after our rider, 
who had gone by a minute before, or whether he was simply scouting conditions; 
but when he passed us by, a musket roared, and he reared his 
horse, swung it around, and began to whip it back in the direction 
from which he had come. He was a fine and showy rider, but his skill 
was wasted on us. From above me and somewhere behind me, a rifle cracked. 
The redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster, and the 
horse reared and threw him from the saddle, except that one booted foot 
caught in the stirrup. Half crazed by the weight dragging, the dust, 
and the heat, the horse leaped our wall, dashing out the rider's brains 
against it, and leaving him lying there among us- while the horse 
crashed away through the brush.   It was my initiation to war 
and the insane symphony war plays; for what had happened on the common 
was only terror and flight; but this grinning, broken head, not 
ten feet away from me, was the sharp definition of what my reality had 
become.   And now the redcoats were coming, and the gunfire was 
a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us. I must state 
that the faster things happened, the slower they happened; the passage 
and rhythm of time changed, and when I remember back to what happened 
then, each event is a separate and frozen incident. In my recollection, 
there was a long interval between the death of the officer and 
the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats, and in that interval 
the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely. Yet 
it could not have been more than a matter of seconds, and then the front 
of the British army came into view.   It was only hours since 
I had last seen them, but they had changed and I had changed. In 
the very front rank, two men were wounded and staggered along, trailing 
blood behind them. No drummers here, no pipers, and the red coats 
were covered with a fine film of dust. They marched with bayonets fixed, 
and as fixed on their faces was anger, fear, and torment. Rank after 
rank of them came down the road, and the faces were all the same, 
and they walked in a sea of dust.   "Committeemen, hold your fire! 
Hold your fire"! a voice called, and what made it even more 
terrible 
and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant, 
only some of them glancing toward the stone wall, from behind which 
the voice came.   The front of their column had already passed 
us, when another officer came riding down the side of the road, not 
five paces from where we were. My Cousin Simmons carried a musket, 
but he had loaded it with bird shot, and as the officer came opposite 
him, he rose up behind the wall and fired. One moment there was a man 
in the saddle; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through 
the redcoat ranks, and during the next second or two, we all of 
us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers. One moment, 
the road was filled with disciplined troops, marching four by four 
with a purpose as implacable as death; the next, a cloud of gun smoke 
covered a screaming fury of sound, out of which the redcoat soldiers 
emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury.   In the course 
of this, they had fired on us; but I have no memory of that. I 
had squeezed the trigger of my own gun, and to my amazement, it had 
fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule; 
and then I was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound, hurling 
more vile language than I ever thought I knew, sobbing and shouting, 
and aware that if I had passed water before, it was not enough, 
for my pants were soaking wet.   I would have stood there and died 
there if left to myself, but Cousin Simmons grabbed my arm in his 
viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there; and then I came 
to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that I 
outdistanced Cousin Simmons by far. Everyone else was running. Later 
we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall. 
Their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching. 
##

We tumbled to a stop in Deacon Gordon's cow hole, a low-lying 
bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle. A dozen 
cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane, as perhaps 
we were at that moment, with the crazy excitement of our first encounter, 
the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road, and the 
thirst of some of the men, which was so great that they waded into the 
muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it. Isaac Pitt, one of the 
men from Lincoln, had taken a musket ball in his belly; and though 
he had found the strength to run with us, now he collapsed and lay on 
the ground, dying, the Reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow. 
It may appear that we were cruel and callous, but no one had time 
to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac- except the Reverend. I know 
that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn 
open by a British musket ball, as Isaac had been, yet I also felt 
relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself. I was drunk 
with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from 
the road, and the fact that I was not afraid now, but only waiting 
to know what to do next.   Meanwhile, I reloaded my gun, as the 
other men were doing. We were less than a quarter of a mile from the 
road, and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and 
dust that hung over it. Wherever you looked, you saw Committeemen 
running across the meadows, some away from the road, some toward it, some 
parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least 
fifty militia were making their way in our direction.   Cousin 
Joshua and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington 
and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving British column, but 
another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this 
section of road. I didn't offer any advice, but I certainly did not 
want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out. 
Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it, 
the British would be gone; but Cousin Simmons said he had watched 
them marching west early in the morning, and moving at a much brisker 
pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass, what with 
the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts.

While this was being discussed, we saw the militia to the west 
of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three 
men as they approached the road. It was the opinion of some of us that 
these must be part of the Committeemen who had been in the Battle 
of the North Bridge, which entitled them to a sort of veteran status, 
and we felt that if they employed this tactic, it was likely enough 
the best one. Mattathias Dover said:   "It makes sense. If 
we cluster together, the redcoats can make an advantage out of it, 
but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of 
us except chase us, and we can outrun them".   That settled it, 
and we broke into parties of two and three. Cousin Joshua Dover 
decided 
to remain with the Reverend and poor Isaac Pitt until life passed away- 
and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world. 
I went off with Cousin Simmons, who maintained that if he didn't 
see to me, he didn't know who would.   "Good heavens, Adam", 
he said, "I thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning 
is when to get out of a place".   "I learned that now", 
I said. ##

We ran east for about half a mile before we turned back 
to the road, panting from the effort and soaked with sweat. There 
was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road, 
and the shouting and gunfire never slackened.   Under the trees, 
there was a dead redcoat, a young boy with a pasty white skin and 
a face full of pimples, who had taken a rifle ball directly between the 
eyes. Three men were around him. They had stripped him of his musket 
and equipment, and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off. 
Cousin Simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away.

"God's name, what are you to rob the dead with the fight 
going on"! Cousin Simmons roared.   They tried to outface 
him, but Joseph Simmons was as wide as two average men, and it would 
have taken braver men than these were to outface him.

That summer the gambling houses were closed, despite the threats 
of Pierre Ameaux, a gaming-card manufacturer. Dancing was no longer 
permitted in the streets. The Bordel and other places of prostitution 
were emptied. The slit breeches had to go. Drunkenness was no 
longer tolerated. In defiance, a chinless reprobate, Jake Camaret, 
marched down the aisle in St& Peter's one Sunday morning, followed 
by one of the women from the Bordel, whose dress and walk plainly 
showed the lack of any shame. Plunking themselves down on the front 
bench, they turned to smirk at those around them.   John's first 
impulse was to denounce their blasphemy. But the thought occurred 
that God would want this opportunity used to tell them about Him. Calmly 
he opened the Bible and read of the woman at the well. He finished 
the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor 
God and man.   The next morning, as the clock struck nine, 
he appeared at the Council meeting in the Town Hall and insisted 
that the couple would have to be punished if the Church was to be respected.

"I have told you before, and I tell you again", Monsieur 
Favre said rudely. "Stick to the preaching of the Gospel"!

John stiffened in anger. "That is the answer the ungodly 
will always make when the Church points its fingers at their sins. 
I say to you that the Church will ever decry evil"!   John's 
reply was like a declaration of war. Monsieur Favre sat down 
in his high-backed stall, lips compressed, eyes glinting. Ablard Corne, 
a short man with a rotunda of stomach, rose. Every eye was on him 
as he began to speak.   "What Master Calvin says is true. 
How can we have a good city unless we respect morality"?   Abel 
Poupin, a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes, got to 
his feet. "We all know that Jake Camaret and the woman are brazenly 
living together. It would be well to show the populace how we deal 
with adulterers".   Philibert Berthelier, the son of the famous 
patriot, disagreed. "Do not listen to that Frenchman. He is throttling 
the liberty my father gave his life to win"!   John 
was quietly insistent. "There can be no compromise when souls are 
in jeopardy".   A week later the sentence of the Council was 
carried out: Jake Camaret and the woman were marched naked through 
the streets past a mocking populace. Before them stalked the beadle, 
proclaiming as he went, "Thus the Council deals with those who break 
its laws- adulterers, thieves, murderers, and lewd persons. Let 
evildoers contemplate their ways, and let every man beware"! ## 

John's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter 
he had just received from his sister Mary. Charles had died two 
weeks before, in early November, without being reconciled to the Church. 
The canons, in a body, had tried to force him on his deathbed to 
let them give him the last rites of the Church, but he had died still 
proclaiming salvation by faith. Burial had taken place at night in 
the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet, so that his enemies 
could not find his body and have it dug up and burned. The Abbot 
of St& Eloi, Claude de Mommor, had been a good friend, but not 
even he thought Charles deserved burial in hallowed ground.   John 
closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's 
bedroom, where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin of her needs. 
The blue-draped Virgin was still there, but no one knelt before her 
now. Not even Varnessa; she, too, prayed only to God. For an 
instant John longed for the sound of the bells of Noyon-la-Sainte, 
the touch of his mother's hand, the lilt of Charles's voice in the 
square raftered rooms, his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons, 
and the sight of the beloved bishop. But he had to follow the light. 
Unless God expected a man to believe the Holy Scriptures, why 
had He given them to him? ##

The white-clad trees stood like 
specters in the February night. Snow buried the streets and covered 
the slanting rooftops, as John trudged toward St& Peter's. A carriage 
crunched by, its dim lights filtering through the gloom. The 
sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated 
the holes of his shoes, his only ones, now patched with folded parchment. 
The city had recently given him a small salary, but it was not 
enough to supply even necessities.   As he neared the square, a 
round figure muffled in a long, black cape whisked by. John recognized 
Ablard Corne and called out a greeting. How grateful he was to such 
men! There were several on the Council who tried to live like Christians. 
Despite their efforts, the problems seemed to grow graver 
all the time. Quickening his steps, John entered the vast church and 
climbed the tower steps to the bells. Underneath the big one, in the 
silent moonlight, lay a dead pigeon, and on the smaller bell, the <Clemence>, 
two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold 
winter air.   John leaned upon the stone balustrade. He brushed 
back his black hair, shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it 
from blowing in his eyes. Below the moon-splashed world rolled away 
to insurmountable white peaks; above him the deep blue sky glittered 
with stars. He stood very still, his arms at his sides, staring up 
at the heavens, then down at the blinking lights below.   "How 
long, my Lord? How long? I have never asked for an easy task, 
but I am weary of the strife".   Sleep was difficult these days. 
Indigestion plagued him. Severe headaches were frequent. Loneliness 
tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of Peter 
Robert, Nerien, Nicholas Cop, Martin Bucer, and even the compromising 
Louis du Tillet. An occasional traveler from Italy brought 
news of Peter Robert, who was now distributing his Bible among the 
Waldensian peasants. Letters came regularly from Nerien, Nicholas, 
and Martin. He had Anthony and William to confide in and consult. 
But William continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and 
tearing down symbols sacred to the Old Church. John found it difficult, 
but he held him in check. And Anthony was busy most of the time 
courting this girl and that. His easy good looks made him a favorite 
with the ladies.   Geneva, instead of becoming the City of God, 
as John had dreamed, had in the two years since he had been there, 
continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished. 
Refugees poured in, signing the Confession and rules in order to remain, 
and then disregarding them. Dice rolled, prostitutes plied their 
trade, thieves stole, murderers stabbed, and the ungodly blasphemed. 
Catholics who were truly Christians longed for the simple penance of 
days gone by. Libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded: 
"Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope, Master Calvin, 
to curtail our liberty? **h Why, oh why, doesn't he stick to preaching 
the Gospel, instead of meddling in civic affairs, politics, 
economics, and social issues that are no concern of the Church"? 
And John's reply was always the same: "Anything that affects 
souls is the concern of the Church! We will have righteousness"!

Tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight. 
Unless the confusion cleared, he would not be coming here much 
longer. Monsieur Favre's threat would become a reality, for he continued 
to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of "that Frenchman".

The slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming 
up to the tower interrupted his reverie. Faint at first, the tapping 
grew until it sounded loud against the wind. Eli Corault! John 
thought. What is he doing here at this hour? He started down the 
steps to meet the near-blind preacher, who had been one of the early Gospelers 
in Paris.   "John? Is that you? I came to warn 
you of a plot"!   John stood above him, his face ashen. What 
now? Slowly, like a man grown old, he took Eli's hand and led 
him below to the tower study, guiding him to a chair beside the little 
hearth where a fire still burned.   "Plot"? John asked 
tiredly.   "Monsieur Favre just paid me a visit. I went to 
your rooms, and Anthony told me you were here. Two Anabaptists, Caroli 
and Benoit, are to challenge you and William to a debate before 
the Council. It is to be a trap. You know the law: if you lose the 
debate after accepting a challenge, you will be banished"!

"What will be the subject"?   "You are to be accused 
of Arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal".   Anger 
and fear fused in John. Ever since the fourth century a controversy 
had raged over the person of Christ. Those who refused to believe 
that He was the eternal Son of God were termed Arianists. Peter 
Caroli had come to Geneva, saying that he had been a bishop of the 
Church of Rome and had been persecuted in Paris for his Reformed faith. 
He asked to be appointed a preacher. But Michael Sept had unmasked 
him, revealing he had never been a bishop, but was an Anabaptist, 
afraid to state his faith, because he knew John Calvin had written 
a book against their belief that the soul slept after death. So John 
had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher, and now Caroli 
sought revenge.   John sighed. "If William agrees, we should 
insist on a public debate", he said at length.   "There 
is more to the conspiracy. Bern demands that the Lord's Supper be 
administered here as it used to be, with unleavened bread. Furthermore, 
Bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council, 
preach only the word of God and stop meddling in politics"!

"It was always the spirit with Christ; matters such as leavened 
or unleavened bread are inconsequential. Geneva must remain a sovereign 
state. We will not yield to the demands of Bern"!   The 
firelight played over Eli's flowing white locks and rugged features. 
"Monsieur Favre indicated that if I would co-operate, after you 
and William are banished, following the debate, I will be given a 
place of influence".   "What was your reply to that"?

"That I would rather be banished with two such Christians than 
be made the Chief Syndic"! ##

The following morning, as 
John entered the Place Molard on his way to visit a sick refugee, 
he had a premonition of danger. Then suddenly a group of men and dogs 
circled him. He wanted to run, but he knew that if he did, he would 
be lost. He stood very still, his heart thumping wildly. On the outskirts 
of the rabble the Camaret brothers and Gaspard Favre shook their 
fists.   "Are you going to comply with the demands of Bern"? 
the chinless Jake called.   "Arianist"! a rowdy with 
a big blob of a nose roared. "Heretic"!   John lifted 
his hand for silence. "Know this: the ministers will not yield to 
the demands of Bern". His voice shook a little.   Somebody 
heaved a stone. For an instant John was stunned.   When he felt 
the side of his head, his fingers came away covered with blood. Before 
he could duck, another stone struck him. And another.   "Let 
him be now"! Pierre Ameaux, the gaming-card manufacturer said, 
his little pig eyes glaring. "We have taught him a lesson".

The crowd moved back and John started dizzily down the hill. Fists 
pummeled him as he staggered forward. Then he slipped and went 
down on his hands and knees in the melting snow. At once a bevy of dogs 
was snapping and snarling around him. One, more horrible than the 
rest, lunged, growling deep in his throat, his hair bristling. With great 
difficulty John clambered to his feet and started to run, sweat 
pouring down his face. 
Standing in the shelter of the tent- a rejected hospital tent 
on which the rain now dripped, no longer drumming- Adam watched his 
own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid 
across two beef barrels. There was, of course, no real need to rearrange 
everything. A quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake, or 
the toffee, or the barley sugar, or the sardines, or the bitters, or 
the condensed milk, or the stationery, or the needles- what could it 
mean? Adam watched his own hands make the caressing, anxious movement 
that, when rain falls and nobody comes, and ruin draws close like 
a cat rubbing against the ankles, has been the ritual of stall 
vendors, forever.   He recognized the gesture. He knew its meaning. 
He had seen a dry, old, yellowing hand reach out, with that painful 
solicitude, to touch, to rearrange, to shift aimlessly, some object 
worth a pfennig. Back in Bavaria he had seen that gesture, and at 
that sight his heart had always died within him. On such occasions he 
had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand, whatever 
face it might be.   Now the face was his own. He wondered what 
expression, as he made that gesture, was on his face. He wondered if 
it wore the old anxiety, or the old, taut stoicism. But there was no 
need, he remembered, for his hand to reach out, for his face to show 
concern or stoicism. It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came. 
Then why was he assuming the role- the gesture and the suffering? 
What was he expiating? Or was he now taking the role- the gesture 
and the suffering- because it was the only way to affirm his 
history and identity in the torpid, befogged loneliness of this land.

This was Virginia.   He looked out of the tent at the 
company street. The rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street. 
Beyond that misty gray of the rain, he saw the stretching hutment, 
low diminutive log cabins, chinked with mud, with doorways a man would 
have to crouch to get through, with roofs of tenting laid over boughs 
or boards from hardtack boxes, or fence rails, with cranky chimneys 
of sticks and dried mud. The chimney of the hut across from him was 
surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out. In this heavy air, 
however, that device did not seem to help. The smoke from that chimney 
rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other, and hung as sadly in the 
drizzle, creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof.

Over the door was a board with large, inept lettering: HOME 
SWEET HOME. This was the hut of Simms Purdew, the hero. 
The men were huddled in those lairs. Adam knew the names of some. He 
knew the faces of all, hairy or shaven, old or young, fat or thin, suffering 
or hardened, sad or gay, good or bad. When they stood about 
his tent, chaffing each other, exchanging their obscenities, cursing command 
or weather, he had studied their faces. He had had the need to 
understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh, behind the oath, 
the banter, the sadness. Once covertly looking at Simms Purdew, the 
only man in the world whom he hated, he had seen the heavy, slack, 
bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel, obscene banter, and had 
seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment, and suddenly 
he was not seeing the face of that vile creature. He was seeing, 
somehow, the face of a young boy, the boy Simms Purdew must once 
have been, a boy with sorrel hair, and blue eyes dancing with gaiety, 
and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles.   In that 
moment of vision Adam heard the voice within himself saying: <I 
must not hate him, I must not hate him or I shall die>.   His 
heart suddenly opened to joy.   He thought that if once, only 
once, he could talk with Simms Purdew, something about his own life, 
and all life, would be clear and simple. If Simms Purdew would turn 
to him and say: "Adam, you know when I was a boy, it was a funny 
thing happened. Lemme tell you now"-   If only Simms 
Purdew could do that, whatever the thing he remembered and told. It 
would be a sign for the untellable, and he, Adam, would understand.

Now, Adam, in the gray light of afternoon, stared across at the 
hut opposite his tent, and thought of Simms Purdew lying in there 
in the gloom, snoring on his bunk, with the fumes of whisky choking the 
air. He saw the sign above the door of the hut: HOME SWEET HOME. 
He saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street, 
with an armful of wood.   It was Pullen James, the campmate 
of Simms Purdew. He carried the wood, carried the water, did the 
cooking, cleaning and mending, and occasionally got a kick in the butt 
for his pains. Adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho. It 
gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam, like metal. Pullen James humbly 
lowered his head, pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut, 
and was gone from sight.   Adam stared at the door and remembered 
that Simms Purdew had been awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry 
at Antietam.   The street was again empty. The drizzle was 
slacking off now, but the light was grayer. With enormous interest, 
Adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the 
board directly before him. Into the emptiness of the street, and his 
spirit, moved a form.   The form was swathed in an army blanket, 
much patched, fastened at the neck with a cord. From under the shapeless 
huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud. The feet wore army 
shoes, in obvious disrepair. The head was wrapped in a turban and on 
top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of poncho 
had been flung. The gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle. 
Moisture ran down the cheeks, gathered at the tip of the nose, and at 
the chin. The figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching 
to dislodge the drop clinging there. The figure stopped and one 
hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose. Then 
the figure moved on.   This was one of the Irish women who had 
built their own huts down near the river. They did washing. Adam recognized 
this one. He recognized her because she was the one who, in 
a winter twilight, on the edge of camp, had once stopped him and reached 
down her hand to touch his fly. "Slice o' mutton, bhoy"? 
she had queried in her soft guttural. "Slice o' mutton"?

Her name was Mollie. They called her Mollie the Mutton, and laughed. 
Looking down the street after her, Adam saw that she had again 
stopped and again removed one hand from the basket. He could not make 
out, but he knew that again she was scratching her nose. Mollie the 
Mutton was scratching her nose.   The words ran crazily in his 
head: <Mollie the Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain>.

Then the words fell into a pattern: "<Mollie the Mutton 
is scratching her nose, Scratching her nose in the rain. Mollie the 
Mutton is scratching her nose in the rain>".

The pattern would not stop. It came 
again and again. He felt trapped in that pattern, in the repetition.

Suddenly he thought he might weep. "What's the matter with 
me"? he demanded out loud. He looked wildly around, at the now 
empty street, at the mud, at the rain. "Oh, what's the matter with 
me"? he demanded. ##

When he had stored his stock in the great 
oak chest, locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain, 
tied the fly of the tent, and picked up the cash box, he moved up 
the darkening street. He would consign the cash box into the hands of 
Jed Hawksworth, then stand by while his employer checked the contents 
and the list of items sold. Then he-   Then what? He did 
not know. His mind closed on that prospect, as though fog had descended 
to blot out a valley.   Far off, in the dusk, he heard voices 
singing, muffled but strong. In one of the huts a group of men were 
huddled together, singing. He stopped. He strained to hear. He heard 
the words: "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me 
hide myself in Thee! Let the water and the blood From Thy riven 
side **h"   He thought: <I am a Jew from 
Bavaria>.   He was standing there, he thought, in Virginia, 
in the thickening dusk, in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to another 
Jew. That other Jew, a young man too, had left that greatcoat 
behind, in a rich house, and marched away. He had crossed the river which 
now, beyond the woods yonder, was sliding darkly under the mist. 
He had plunged into the dark woods beyond. He had died there. 
What had that man, that other young Jew, felt as he stood in the twilight 
and heard other men, far away, singing together?.   Adam 
thought of the hutments, regiment after regiment, row after row, the 
thousands of huts, stretching away into the night. He thought of the 
men, the nameless thousands, huddling in them. He thought of Simms 
Purdew snoring on his bunk while Pullen James crouched by the hearth, 
skirmishing an undershirt for lice, and a wet log sizzled. He thought 
of Simms Purdew, who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield, 
a 
maniacal scream on his lips, and swung a clubbed musket like a flail 
to beat down the swirl of Rebel bayonets about him.   He thought 
of Simms Purdew rising up, fearless in glory. He felt the sweetness 
of pity flood through him, veining his very flesh. Those men, lying 
in the huts, they did not know. They did not know who they were or 
know their own worth. In the pity for them his loneliness was gone.

Then he thought of Aaron Blaustein standing in his rich house 
saying: "God is tired of taking the blame. He is going to let 
History take the blame for a while".   He thought of the old 
man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier.   He thought: 
<Only in my heart can I make the world hang together>. ## 

Adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut. He saw Mose 
squatting by the hearth, breaking up hardtack into a pan. A pot was 
boiling on the coals. "Done give Ole Buckra all his money"? 
Mose asked softly.   Adam nodded.   "Yeah", Mose murmured, 
"yeah. And look what he done give us".   Adam looked 
at the pot. "What is it"? he asked.   "Chicken", Mose 
said, and theatrically licked his lips. "Gre't big fat chicken, 
yeah". He licked his lips again.   Then: "Yeah. A chicken 
with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew. And hit squealed for 
slop". Mose giggled. "Fooled you, huh? It is the same ole same, 
tell me hit's name. It is sowbelly with tits on. It is salt po'k. 
It is salt po'k and skippers. That po'k, it was so full of 
skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say, 'Hoo-pig'. 
Had to put my foot on it to hole it down while I cut it up fer 
the lob-scuse".   He dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into 
the boiling pot of lobscouse. "Good ole lob-scuse", he mumbled, 
and stirred the pot. He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder. 
"Know what Ole Buckra et tonight"? he demanded. "Know what 
I had to fix fer Ole Him"?   Adam shook his head.

"Chicken", Mose said. 
She was a child too much a part of her environment, too eager to grow 
and learn and experience. Once, they were at Easthampton for the summer 
(again, Fritzie said, a good place, even though they were being 
robbed). 
One soft evening- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the 
sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts 
everything- Amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk. 
Fritzie was on the couch reading; Laura was sitting in an easy chair 
about eight feet away. The infant, in white terry-cloth bathrobe, 
her face intense and purposeful, had essayed a few wobbly steps toward 
her father. "Y'all wanna walk- walk", he said. Then, gently, 
he shoved her behind toward Laura. Amy walked- making it halfway 
across the cottage floor. She lost not a second, picking herself up 
and continuing her pilgrimage to Laura. Then Laura took her gently 
and shoved her off again, toward Fritzie: Amy did not laugh- this 
was work, concentration, achievement. In a few minutes she was making 
the ten-foot hike unaided; soon she was parading around the house, 
flaunting her new skill.   Some liar's logic, a wisp of optimism 
as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the 
window (a euphoria perhaps engendered by the pill Fritzie had given 
her), consoled her for a moment. Amy <had> to be safe, <had> to 
come back to them- if only to reap that share of life's experiences 
that were her due, if only to give her parents another chance to do 
better by her. Through the swathings of terror, she jabbed deceit's 
sharp point- Amy would be reborn, a new child, with new parents, 
living under new circumstances. The comfort was short-lived, yet she 
found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced 
images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion. 
Gazing at her husband's drugged 
body, his chest rising and falling in mindless 
rhythms, she saw the grandeur of his fictional world, that lush 
garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs. She envied him. She 
admired him.   In the darkness, she saw him stirring. He seemed 
to be muttering, his voice surprisingly clear. "Y'all should 
have 
let me take that money out", Andrus said. "'Nother minute 
I'd have been fine. Y'all 
should have let me do it".   Laura touched 
his hand. "Yes, I know, Fritzie. I should have". 

#TUESDAY# 

The heat intensified on Tuesday. Southern California gasped 
and blinked under an autumn hot spell, drier, more enervating, more 
laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer 
past. It could continue this way, hitting 106 and more in the Valley, 
Joe McFeeley knew, into October. He and Irvin Moll were sipping 
coffee at the breakfast bar. Both had been up since 7:00- 
Irv 
on the early-morning watch, McFeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour 
relief. The night before, they had telephoned the Andrus maid, 
Selena Masters, and she had arrived early, bursting her vigorous 
presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley 
and confounded Moll. The latter, thanking her for the coffee, had 
winked and muttered, "Sure 'nuff, honey". Selena was the wrong 
woman for these crudities. With a hard eye, she informed Moll: "Don't 
<sure 'nuff> me, officer. I'm <honey> only to my husband, 
understand"? Sergeant Moll understood. The maid was very 
black and very energetic, trim in a yellow pique uniform. Her speech 
was barren of southernisms; she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized 
minorities, adopting the rolling ~<R's> and constricted 
vowels of Los Angeles. Not seeing her dark intelligent face, one 
would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood Village matron, ten 
years out of Iowa. After she had served the detectives coffee and 
toast (they politely declined eggs, uncomfortable about their tenancy), 
she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock 
market quotations. While she was thus engaged, McFeeley questioned 
her about her whereabouts the previous day, any recollections she 
had of people hanging around, of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen, 
of strange cars cruising the neighborhood. She answered him precisely, 
missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports. Selena 
Masters, Joe realized, was her own woman. She was the only kind 
of Negro Laura Andrus would want around: independent, unservile, 
probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework- and 
doubly efficient.   When the parents emerged from the bedroom 
a few minutes later, the maid greeted them quietly. "I'm awful sorry 
about what's happened", Selena said. "Maybe today'll be 
a good-news day". She charged off to the bedrooms.   Moll 
took his coffee 
into the nursery. During the night, a phone company technician 
had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones. Someone 
would have to remain in the office continually. McFeeley greeted 
the parents, then studied his notebook. He wanted to take the mother 
to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file.   "Sleep 
well"? he asked.   Andrus did not answer him. His face was 
bloated with drugging, redder than normal. The woman had the glassy 
look of an invalid, as if she had not slept at all. "Oh- we managed", 
she said. "I'm a little groggy. Did anything happen during 
the night"?   "Few crank calls", McFeeley said. "A 
couple of tips we're running down- nothing promising. We can 
expect more of the same. Too bad your number is in the directory".

"Didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had 
it listed", Andrus muttered. He settled on the sofa with his coffee, 
warming his hands on the cup, although the room was heavy with heat.

The three had little to say to each other. The previous night's 
horror- the absolute failure, overcast with the intrusions of 
the press, had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness, of play-acting. 
Sipping their coffee, discussing the weather, the day's shopping, 
Fritzie's commitments at the network (all of which he would 
cancel), they avoided the radio, the morning ~TV news show, even 
the front page of the <Santa Luisa Register>, resting on the kitchen 
bar. KIDNAPER SPURNS RANSOM; AMY STILL MISSING. Once, 
Andrus walked by it, hastily scanned the bold black headline and 
the five-column lead of the article (by Duane Bosch, staff correspondent- 
age not given), and muttered: "We a buncha national celebrities".

McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to 
police headquarters in a half hour. Before that, he wanted to talk to 
the neighbors. He did not want to bring the Andruses to the station 
house too early- Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference, and he 
didn't want them subjected to the reporters again. He could think 
of nothing else to tell them: no assurances, no hopeful hints at great 
discoveries that day. When the detective left, Andrus phoned his 
secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute 
director for his current project. Mrs& Andrus was talking to 
the 
maid, arranging for her to come in every day, instead of the four days 
she now worked.   Outside, only a handful of reporters remained. 
The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference. 
In contrast to the caravan of the previous night, there were only 
four cars parked across the street. Two men he did not recognize were 
sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls. He did not see Sparling, or 
DeGroot, or Ringel, or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed 
him twelve hours ago. However, the litter remained, augmented by 
several dozen lunchroom suppers. The street cleaner had not yet been 
around.   One of the reporters called to him: "Anything new, 
Lieutenant"? And he ignored him, skirting the parked cars and 
walking up the path to the Skopas house. When McFeeley was halfway 
to the door, the proprietor emerged- a mountainous, dark man, his 
head thick with resiny black hair, his eyes like two of the black olives 
he imported in boatloads. McFeeley identified himself. The master 
of the house, his nourished face unrevealing, consented to postpone 
his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective.   Inside, 
as soon as Mr& Skopas had disclosed- in a hoarse whisper- the 
detective's errand, his family gathered in a huddle, forming a mass 
of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of 
a baroque fireplace. Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps, they 
seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait.   It was amazing how 
they had herded together for protection: an enormous matriarch in 
a quilted silk wrapper, rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy 
in his teens, shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands; 
a girl in her twenties, fat and sullen, descending the marble 
staircase; 
then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor.

They answered him in monosyllables, nods, occasionally muttering 
in Greek to one another, awaiting the word from Papa, who restlessly 
cracked his knuckles, anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac 
and burst off to the freeway. No, they hadn't seen anyone around; 
no, they didn't know the Andrus family; yes, they had read 
about the case; yes, they had let some reporters use their phone, 
but they would no longer. They offered no opinions, volunteered nothing, 
betrayed no emotions. Studying them, McFeeley could not help make 
comparison with the Andrus couple. The Skopas people seemed to him 
of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy. 
He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined 
(if they were, they were never penalized), whose children had no 
unhappy romances, whose names never knew scandal. The equation was 
simple: 
wealth brought them happiness, and their united front to the world 
was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had, let 
no one in on the secrets. By comparison, Fritzie and Laura Andrus 
were quivering fledglings. They possessed no outer fortifications, no 
hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from 
day to day, let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them. Skopas 
expressed no curiosity over the case, offered no expression of sympathy, 
made no move to escort McFeeley to the door. All four remained 
impacted on the sofa until he had left.   He had spoken to Mrs& 
Emerson the previous day. There remained a family named Kahler, 
owners of a two-story Tudor-style house on the south side of the Andrus 
home. Their names had not come up in any discussions with Laura, 
and he had no idea what they would be like. McFeeley noted the immaculate 
lawn and gardens: each blade of grass cropped, bright and firm; 
each shrub glazed with good health.   The door was answered 
by a slender man in his sixties- straight-backed, somewhat clerical 
in manner, wearing rimless glasses. When Joe identified himself, he 
nodded, unsmiling, and ushered him into a sedate living room. Mrs& 
Kahler joined them. She had a dried-out quality- a gray, lean woman, 
not unattractive. Both were dressed rather formally. The man wore 
a vest and a tie, the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands 
of pearls.   "Funny thing", Mr& Kahler said, when they 
were seated, "when I heard you ringing, I figured it was that guy 
down the block, Hausman". McFeeley looked puzzled. Kahler continued: 
"I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he's sore, 
so I expected him to come barging in". Mr& Kahler went on to explain 
how Hausman's fox terrier had been "making" in his flower 
beds. The dog refused to be scared off, so Kahler had purchased some 
small firecrackers. He would lay in wait in the garage, and when the 
terrier came scratching around, he'd let fly with a cherry bomb. "Scared 
the hell out of him", Kahler grinned. "I hit him in the 
ass once". Both grinned at the detective. "Finally, all I needed 
was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker 
and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life". 
In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room, 
and then they went across the hall to the kitchen. She was intimidated 
by the stove. He found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners 
for her. The gas flamed up two inches high. They found the teakettle 
and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox. 
Several sections of a loaf of dark bread; butter; jam; a tiny 
cake of ice. In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast 
china but the wrong table silver, they opened every cupboard door 
in the kitchen and pantry. While she was settling the teacart, he went 
back across the hall to their bedroom, opened one of the suitcases, 
and took out powdered coffee and sugar. She appeared with the teacart 
and he opened the windows.   "Do you want to call Eugene"?

He didn't, but it was not really a question, and so he 
left the room, walked down the hall to the front of the apartment, hesitated, 
and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study. A sleepy 
voice answered.   "Le petit dejeuner", Harold said, in 
an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan, his high-school French teacher. 
At the same time, his voice betrayed uncertainty about their 
being here, and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable, peace-loving, 
and dependable in everybody.   Since ordinary breakfast-table 
conversation was impossible, it was at least something that they were 
able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it, and the 
plate of bread and butter, and that Eugene could return the pitcher 
of hot milk to them handle first. Eugene put a spoonful of powdered 
coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water. Stirring, he 
said: "I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with 
you today".   They assured him that they did not expect or 
need to be entertained.   Harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee 
in 
his cup and filled it with hot water, and then, stirring, he sat back 
in his chair. The chair creaked. Every time he moved or said something, 
the chair creaked again.   Eugene was not entirely silent, 
or openly rude- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and 
placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act 
of rudeness. It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight, 
and all it needed, Harold thought, was for somebody to fling himself 
back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it. 
Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street: cartwheels, 
a tired horse's plodding step, voices. Harold indicated the 
photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was 
in. Eugene told him and he promptly forgot. They passed the marmalade, 
the bread, the black-market butter, back and forth. Nothing was said 
about hotels or train journeys.   Eugene offered Harold his 
car, to use at any time he cared to, and when this offer was not accepted, 
the armchair creaked. They all three had another cup of coffee. 
Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown, and on his large feet he 
wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes.   "Ex-cuse 
me", he said in Berlitz English, and got up and left them, 
to bathe and dress.   The first shrill ring of the telephone brought 
Harold out into the hall. He realized that he had no idea where 
the telephone was. At that moment the bathroom door flew open and 
Eugene came out, with his face lathered for shaving, and strode down 
the hall, tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went. The telephone 
was in the study but the ringing came from the hall. Between the telephone 
and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord, and when the 
conversation came to an end, Eugene carried the instrument with him the 
whole length of the apartment, to his bathroom, where it rang three 
more times while he was shaving and in the tub. Before he left the apartment 
he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could 
do for them. Harold shook his head.   "Sabine called a few 
minutes ago", Eugene said. "She wants you and Barbara to have 
dinner with her tomorrow night".   He handed Harold a key to 
the front door, and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while 
they were out of the apartment.   When enough time had elapsed so 
that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had 
forgotten, Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one 
room after another. In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle, of 
mahogany, ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf. It was the 
most important-looking cradle he had ever seen. Then came their bathroom, 
and then a bedroom that, judging by the photographs on the walls, 
must belong to ~Mme Cestre. A young woman who looked like Alix, 
with her two children. Alix and Eugene on their wedding day. Matching 
photographs in oval frames of ~Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man 
who must be Alix's grandfather. ~Mme Vienot, considerably younger 
and very different. The schoolboy. And a gray-haired man whose 
glance- direct, lifelike, and mildly accusing- was contradicted by 
the gilt and black frame. It was the kind of frame that is only put 
around the photograph of a dead person. Professor Cestre, could it 
be?   With the metal shutters closed, the dining room was so dark 
that it seemed still night in there. One of the drawing-room shutters 
was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas, which 
seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet. The curtains 
were of the same material, and there were some big oil paintings- portraits 
in the style of Lancret and Boucher.   Though, taken 
individually, the big rooms were, or seemed to be, square, the apartment 
as a whole formed a triangle. The apex, the study where Eugene slept, 
was light and bright and airy and cheerful. The window looked out 
on the Place Redoute- it was the only window of the apartment that 
did. Looking around slowly, he saw a marble fireplace, a desk, a low 
bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass 
panes in the doors. The daybed Eugene had slept in, made up now with 
its dark-brown velours cover and pillows. The portable record player 
with a pile of classical records beside it. Beethoven's Fifth was 
the one on top. Da-da-da-dum **h Music could not be Eugene's passion. 
Besides, the records were dusty. He tried the doors of the bookcase. 
Locked. The titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed 
wires: works on theology, astral physics, history, biology, political 
science. No poetry. No novels. He moved over to the desk and 
stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything. The clock 
on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced 
at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room. #@# 

THE CONCIERGE CALLED OUT to them as they were passing through 
the foyer. 
Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building, and 
her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture- a big, round, 
oak dining table and chairs, a buffet, with a row of unclaimed letters 
inserted between the mirror and its frame. The suitcases had come 
while they were out, and had been put in their room, the concierge said.

He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said: 
"Now what do we do"?   "Call the Vouillemont, I 
guess".   "I guess".   Rather than sit around waiting 
for the suitcases to be delivered, they had gone sight-seeing. They 
went to the Flea Market, expecting to find the treasures of Europe, 
and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in 
Tours. Cheap clothing and junk of every sort, as far as the eye could 
see. They looked, even so. Looked at everything. Barbara bought 
some cotton aprons, and Harold bought shoestrings. They had lunch 
at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad, busy, 
unpicturesque streets, and coming home they got lost in the Metro; 
it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should 
have changed, in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute. 
It was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of 
his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole. When he opened the door, 
there stood Eugene, on his way out of the apartment. He was wearing 
sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt, and in his hand he carried 
a little black bag. He did not explain where he was going, and 
they did not ask. Instead, they went on down the hall to their room.

"Do you think he could be having an affair"? Barbara asked, 
as they heard the front door close.   "Oh no", Harold 
said, shocked.   "Well, this is France, after all". 
"I know, but there must be some other explanation. He's probably 
spending the evening with friends".   "And for that he needs 
a little bag"?   They went shopping in the neighborhood, 
and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given 
in Blois, and some cheese, and a dozen eggs, and a bag of oranges 
from a peddler in the Place Redoute- the first oranges they had 
seen since they landed. They had Vermouth, sitting in front of a cafe. 
When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment, 
and thought how, under different circumstances, they might have 
stayed on here, in these old-fashioned, high-ceilinged rooms that 
reminded him of the Irelands' apartment in the East Eighties. They 
could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days.   He 
went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom, to turn on the hot-water 
heater, and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming 
trunks. He felt them. They were damp. He reached out and felt the 
bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub. Damp also. He looked 
around the room and then called out: "Come here, quick"?

"What is it"? Barbara asked, standing in the doorway. "I've 
solved the mystery of the little bag. There it is **h and there 
is what was in it. But where do people go swimming in Paris? 
That boat in the river, maybe".   "What boat"?   "There's 
a big boat anchored near the Place de la Concorde, with 
a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice it? But if he has time 
to go swimming, he had time to be with us".   She looked at 
him in surprise.   "I know", he said, reading her mind.

"I don't know what I'm going to do with you".   "It's 
because we are in France", he said, "and know so few people. 
So something like this matters more than it would at home. Also, 
he was so nice when he <was> nice".   "All because I didn't 
feel like dancing".   "I don't think it was that, really".

"Then what was it"?   "I don't know. I 
wish I did. The tweed coat, maybe. The thing about Eugene is that 
he's very proud".   And the thing about hurt feelings, the 
wet bathing suit pointed out, is that the person who has them is not quite 
the innocent party he believes himself to be. For instance- what 
about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly, 
as if this were the one moment they would ever have together, their one 
chance of knowing each other?   Fortunately, the embarrassing 
questions raised by objects do not need to be answered, or we would 
all have to go sleep in the open fields. And in any case, answers may 
clarify but they do not change anything. 
**h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes, of about a hundred 
pounds' weight. They took Jesus's body, then, and wrapped it 
in winding-clothes with the spices; that is how the Jews prepare a 
body for burial.   Listed as present at the Descent were Mary, 
Mary's sister, Mary Magdalene, John, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus. 
Search as he might, he could find no place where the Bible 
spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus. Mostly 
the scene was crowded with mourners, such as the dramatic Dell'Arca 
Lamentation in Bologna, where the grief-stricken spectators had 
usurped Mary's last poignant moment.   In his concept there could 
be no one else present.   His first desire was to create a 
mother and son alone in the universe. When might Mary have had that 
moment to hold her child on her lap? Perhaps after the soldiers had 
laid him on the ground, while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's 
asking for Christ's body, Nicodemus was gathering his mixture 
of myrrh and aloes, and the others had gone home to mourn. Those 
who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses. 
They would feel what Mary was undergoing. There would be no 
halos, no angels. These would be two human beings, whom God had chosen.

He felt close to Mary, having spent so long concentrating 
on the beginning of her journey. Now she was intensely alive, anguished; 
her son was dead. Even though he would later be resurrected, 
he was at this moment dead indeed, the expression on his face reflecting 
what he had gone through on the cross. In his sculpture therefore 
it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt 
for his mother; only what Mary felt for her son. Jesus' inert 
body would be passive, his eyes closed. Mary would have to carry the 
human communication. This seemed right to him.   It was a relief 
to shift in his mind to technical problems. Since his Christ was 
to be life size, how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship 
seeming ungainly? His Mary would be slender of limb and 
delicate of proportion, yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely 
and convincingly as she would a child.   There was only one 
way to accomplish this: by design, by drawing diagrams and sketches 
in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas 
to carry his concept.   He started by making free sketches to loosen 
up his thinking so that images would appear on paper. Visually, 
these approximated what he was feeling within himself. At the same time 
he started walking the streets, peering at the people passing or shopping 
at the stalls, storing up fresh impressions of what they looked 
like, how they moved. In particular he sought the gentle, sweet-faced 
nuns, with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads, 
remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them 
down on paper.   Discovering that draperies could be designed 
to serve structural purposes, he began a study of the anatomy of folds. 
He improvised as he went along, completing a life-size clay figure, 
then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper, wet the 
lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento 
brought from the bank of the Tiber, to the consistency of thick 
mud. No fold could be accidental, each turn of the drapery had to serve 
organically, to cover the Madonna's slender legs and feet so that 
they would give substantive support to Christ's body, to intensify 
her inner turmoil. When the cloth dried and stiffened, he saw what 
adjustments had to be made.   "So that's sculpture", commented 
Argiento wryly, when he had sluiced down the floor for a week, "making 
mud pies".   Michelangelo grinned. "See, Argiento, 
if you control the way these folds are bunched, like this, or made to 
flow, you can enrich the body attitudes. They can have as much tactile 
appeal as flesh and bone".   He went into the Jewish quarter, 
wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding 
of how Christ might have looked. The Jewish section was 
in Trastevere, near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa. 
The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 
drove many Jews into Rome. Here, for the most part, they were well 
treated, as a "reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity"; 
many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican 
as physicians, musicians, bankers.   The men did not object to 
his sketching them while they went about their work, but no one could 
be persuaded to come to his studio to pose. He was told to ask for 
Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon. Michelangelo found 
the rabbi in the room of study, a gentle old man with a white beard 
and luminous grey eyes, robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on 
his head. He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his 
congregation. When Michelangelo explained why he had come, Rabbi 
Melzi replied gravely:   "The Bible forbids us to bow down 
to or to make graven images. That is why our creative people give their 
time to literature, not to painting or sculpture".   "But, 
Rabbi Melzi, you don't object to others creating works of art"?

"Not at all. Each religion has its own tenets".

"I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble. I wish to make 
Jesus an authentic Jew. I cannot accomplish this if you will not 
help me".   The rabbi said thoughtfully, "I would not want 
my people to get in trouble with the Church".   "I am working 
for the Cardinal of San Dionigi. I'm sure he would approve".

"What kind of models would you prefer"?   "Workmen. 
In their mid-thirties. Not bulky laborers, but sinewy men. With 
intelligence. And sensitivity".   Rabbi Melzi smiled at 
him with infinitely old but merry eyes.   "Leave me your address. 
I will send you the best the quarter has to offer". Michelangelo 
hurried to Sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches, 
asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the 
seated Madonna. Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle 
couch. Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber. Together he and Argiento 
built the stand, covering it with blankets.   His first 
model arrived at dusk. He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked 
him to disrobe, so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to 
wrap around his loins, led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes. 
He then draped him over the rough stand, explained that he was supposed 
to be recently dead, and was being held on his mother's lap. The 
model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy; only the instructions 
from his rabbi kept him from bolting. But at the end of the sitting, 
when Michelangelo showed him the quick, free drawings, with the 
mother roughed in, holding her son, the model grasped what Michelangelo 
was after, and promised to speak to his friends **h. He worked for 
two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi.   Mary presented 
quite a different problem. Though this sculpture must take place 
thirty-three 
years after her moment of decision, he could not conceive 
of her as a woman in her mid-fifties, old, wrinkled, broken in body and 
face by labor or worry. His image of the Virgin had always been that 
of a young woman, even as had his memory of his mother.   Jacopo 
Galli introduced him into several Roman homes. Here he sketched, 
sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk, young girls not yet 
twenty, some about to be married, some married a year or two. Since 
the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men, he had had no experience 
in the study of female anatomy; but he had sketched the women of 
Tuscany in their fields and homes. He was able to discern the body 
lines of the Roman women under their robes.   He spent concentrated 
weeks putting his two figures together: a Mary who would be young 
and sensitive, yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and 
a Jesus who, though lean, was strong even in death **h a look he remembered 
well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito. 
He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory, 
without need to consult his sketches.   Soon he was ready 
to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay. Here he would have free 
expression because the material could be moved to distort forms. When 
he wanted to emphasize, or get greater intensity, he added or subtracted 
clay. Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of 
wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence. He respected each 
of these approach techniques, and kept them in character: his quill 
drawings had a scratchiness, suggesting skin texture; the clay he used 
plastically to suggest soft moving flesh, as in an abdomen, in a reclining 
torso; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an 
elastic pull. Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his 
mind; they remained rough starting points. When carving he was charged 
with spontaneous energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay 
and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model.

The true surge had to be inside the marble itself. Drawing and 
models were his thinking. Carving was action.

The arrangement 
with Argiento was working well, except that sometimes Michelangelo 
could not figure who was master and who apprentice. Argiento had 
been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable 
to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors, whether 
they were dirty or not; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry 
every day, the pots scoured with river sand after each meal.

"Argiento, this is senseless", he complained, not liking to work 
on the wet floors, particularly in cold weather. "You're too clean. 
Scrub the studio once a week. That's enough".   "No", 
said Argiento stolidly. "Every day. Before dawn. I was taught".

"And God help anyone who tries to unteach you"! 
grumbled Michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble 
about, for Argiento made few demands on him. The boy was becoming acquainted 
with the <contadini> families that brought produce into Rome. 
On Sundays he would walk miles into the <campagna> to visit with 
them, and in particular to see their horses. The one thing he missed 
from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals; frequently he would 
take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing:   "Today 
I go see the horses".   It took a piece of bad luck to show 
Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him. He was crouched over his 
anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim, when a splinter 
of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil. He stumbled 
into the house, eyes burning like fire. Argiento made him lie 
down on the bed, brought a pan of hot water, dipped some clean white linen 
cloth and applied it to extract the splinter. Though the pain was 
considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned. He assumed he could 
blink the splinter out. But it would not come. Argiento never left 
his side, keeping the water boiled, applying hot compresses throughout 
the night.   By the second day Michelangelo began to worry; 
and by the second night he was in a state of panic: he could see nothing 
out of the afflicted eye. At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli. 
Galli arrived with his family surgeon, Maestro Lippi. The surgeon 
carried a cage of live pigeons. He told Argiento to take a bird 
out of the cage, cut a large vein under its wing, let the blood gush 
into Michelangelo's injured eye.   The surgeon came back at 
dusk, cut the vein of a second pigeon, again washed out the eye.

Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps. 
The thin legs twitched convulsively once, then Kate felt the little 
body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound. The scant 
flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands. The child was gone.

When Juanita awoke, Kate was still rocking the dead child, still 
crooning in disbelief, "No, no, oh, <no!>"   They put 
Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian 
minister. He sat beside Kate's bed with the others throughout the 
morning, talking, talking of God's will, while Kate lay staring angrily 
at him. When he told her God had called the child to Him, she 
rejected his words rebelliously.   Few of the neighbors came, but 
Mrs& Tussle came, called by tragedy. "It always comes in 
threes", she sighed heavily. "Trouble never comes but in threes".

They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads 
church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot. Kate moved 
through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment. 
She would not accept the death of such a little child. "God called 
her to Him", the minister had said. God would not <do> that, 
Kate thought stubbornly.   Jonathan's letter came, as she knew 
it would, and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment 
from God against both Kate and himself. In blind panic of grief 
she accepted Jonathan's dictum, and believed in her desperation that 
she had been cursed by God. She held Jonathan's letter, his words 
burning like a brand, and knew suddenly that the bonds between them 
were severed. She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his 
son. Joel came and sat mutely with her, sharing her pain and anguish, 
averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom.   Juanita and 
Mrs& Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried. When 
she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion 
save dedication to duty. She disciplined herself daily to do what 
must be done. She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs 
in the nurse's room off the empty nursery, although the girl tried 
to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of 
the baby's death.   Juanita drooped about the place, wearing 
a haunted, brooding look, which Kate attributed to the baby's death, 
until the day a letter came for her addressed to "Miss Juanita Fitzroy", 
bearing a Grafton postmark. Seeing the slanting hand, Kate 
knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel. The Federal 
forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving 
to take all the mountains. Kate tried to contain her curiosity 
and foreboding at what the letter portended, at what involvement existed 
for Juanita.   Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom 
lands with difficulty, for more of the slaves, including Annie, 
had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp. Joel worked like a field 
hand in the afternoons after school. He had been at lessons in the 
schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry. Kate felt she 
had deserted the boy in her own loss. She loved him and missed his company.

Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some 
secret business of his own. What it was Kate could not fathom. He 
claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play 
cards and drink with his cronies, but Kate had not smelled brandy 
on him since Mrs& Lattimer's funeral. Joel knew what he was about, 
however.   "You're gonna get caught", she heard Joel 
say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning.   "Not this old 
fox", chuckled Uncle Randolph. "Everybody knows I'm just 
a harmless, deaf old man who takes to drink. I aim to keep a little whisky 
still back in the ridge for my pleasure".   "Whisky still, 
my foot", said Joel. "You're back there riding with the 
guerrillas, the Moccasin Rangers".   "Hush", said Uncle 
Randolph, smiling, "or I'll give you another black eye". He 
patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at 
the crossroads some days back.   Kate had no idea what they were 
talking of, although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires 
burning and winking on the ridges at night, had heard horsemen on the 
River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn. Stranger, 
Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle, 
drunkenly singing "Old Dan Tucker" at the top of his voice. 
Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road, Kate would await 
him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house, cold 
sober. What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of 
another broadside proclamation by General McClellan, threatening 
reprisals against Rebel guerrillas. She was taken up in worry for the 
reckless old man.   Kate drew more and more on her affection for 
Joel through the hot days of summer work. She had taken him out of 
the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer, after she saw 
Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake 
loose in the schoolroom. Kate had walked past the school on her morning 
chores and had seen the whole incident, had seen Joel's burning 
humiliation before Miss Snow's cold, bespectacled wrath. He had 
the hardest pains of growing before him now, as he approached twelve. 
These would be his hardest years, she knew, and he missed his father 
desperately.   She tried to find some way to draw him out, to 
help him. Whenever she found time, she went blackberry picking with 
him, and they would come home together, mouths purple, arms and faces 
scratched, tired enough to forget grief for another day. He tended the 
new 
colts Beau had sired. He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower 
garden in the side yard, where they sometimes sat in the still evenings 
watching the last fat bees working against the summer's purple dusk.

No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph. 
They stayed in their own world on the bluff, waiting for letters 
and the peddler, bringing 
the news. Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction 
of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it; of their first 
engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade 
had destroyed all the rolling stock of the ~B+O Railroad. The men 
were restive, he wrote, ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson 
wished.   The peddler came bawling his wares and told them 
of the convention in Wheeling, Which had formed a new state government 
by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because 
they were traitors. Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them, he told 
of the Rebel losses in the mountains, at Cheat and Rich mountains 
both, and the Federal march on Beverly.   "Cleaned all them 
Rebs out'n the hills, they did! They won't never git over inter 
loyal western Virginia, them traitors! The Federals is making 
everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too", he crowed.

After he had gone, Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly, "Would 
you take their oath"?   And the old man had given a 
sly and wicked laugh and said, "Hell, yes! I think I've taken 
it about fifty times already"! winking at Joel's look of shock.

Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's 
baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South "And, dear 
Kate", she wrote, "poor Dr& Breckenridge's son Robert 
is now organizing a militia company to go South, to his good father's 
sorrow. Maj& Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers 
for the U&S& Army. In spite of the fact that the state 
legislature voted us neutral, John Hunt Morgan is openly flying 
the Confederate flag over his woolen factory"!   Rumor of a 
big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley. Accounts were garbled 
at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg 
for the news.   "All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas 
Junction and it were a <big> fight", the old man told them.

In the next few days they had cause to rejoice. It had been 
a big battle, and the Confederate forces had won. Jonathan and Ben 
were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing. Kate and 
Mrs& Tussle waited for letters anxiously. Joel went to the crest 
of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate. 
When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out, she 
saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few 
scattered fires of the faithful. They all prayed now that the North 
would realize that peace must come, for Virginia had defended her land 
victoriously.   The week after Manassas the sound of horses 
in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when 
she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window. They had already 
lost most of their corn, she thought. Were they to be insulted again 
because of the South's great victory? She remembered McClellan's 
last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs.

At the landing she saw Juanita, her face flushed pink with excitement, 
run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door. Juanita 
stopped just inside the open door, her hand to her mouth. As Kate 
came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed 
in the doorway, his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore. 
Kate greeted him gravely, uneasy with misgivings at his visit.

"What brings you here again, Colonel Marsh"? she asked, 
taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed 
against the afternoon sun.   "I stopped to say goodbye, Mrs& 
Lattimer, and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby. 
I wish our doctor could have saved her".   "It was a terrible 
loss to me", said Kate quietly, feeling the pain twist again 
at the mention, knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at 
Grafton. "Where will you go now that you're leaving Parkersburg"? 
she asked him, seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak.   "As 
you know, General McClellan has been occupying Beverly. He has 
notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the 
Army of the Potomac. I am to go to Washington to serve with him".

"When are you to leave"? Kate asked, watching them both 
now anxiously. Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions, she 
thought sadly.   "Tomorrow. Would you permit Juanita to walk 
about the grounds with me for a short spell, Mrs& Lattimer"?

"Stay here in the parlor where it's cool", she said, trying 
to be calm. It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and 
Mrs& Tussle not to see them.   Kate went back and reminded 
the kitchen women of the supper preparations. Then she took iced lemonade 
to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees 
around the flower garden. When Marsh called to his aide and the pair 
rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue, Juanita 
was shaken and trying not to cry. She sought Kate out upstairs, 
her lips trembling.   "He wants me to go with him tomorrow", 
she told Kate.   "What do you want to do"? Kate asked, 
uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma.   "I could go 
with him. He knows me as your niece, which, of course, I am. But I 
am a slave! You <own> me. It's your decision", said Juanita, 
holding her face very still, trying to contain the bitterness of her 
voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly.   "No, the 
decision is yours. I have held your papers of manumission since I 
married Mr& Lattimer".

The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky. The two in 
the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they 
have shared the same bed for many years, and they needed to say no 
more. The things left unsaid they both felt deeply, and with a sigh they 
fell back on the well-stuffed pillows. Anita put out the remaining 
candles with a long snuffer, and in the smell of scented candlewick, 
the comforting awareness of each other's bodies, the retained pattern 
of dancers and guests remembered, their minds grew numb and then empty 
of images. They slept- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched 
snoring, the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table. 
##

In the ballroom below, the dark had given way to moonlight 
coming in through the bank of French windows. It was a delayed moon, 
but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared 
the silver-gray sky. Martha Schuyler, old, slow, careful of foot, came 
down the great staircase, dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk, 
her jeweled shoe buckles held forward.   "Well, I'm here 
at last", she said, addressing the old portraits on the walls. "I 
don't hear the music. I am getting deaf, I must admit it".

She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that 
led down to it. "Where is everyone? I say, where is everyone? 
Peter, you lummox, you've forgot to order the musicians". 
She stood there, a large old woman, smiling at the things she would 
say to him in the morning, this big foolish baby of a son. There were 
times now, like this, when she lost control of the time count and moved 
freely back and forth into three generations. Was it a birthday ball? 
When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen? Or was it 
her own first ball as mistress of this big house, a Van Rensselaer bride 
from way upstate near Albany, from Rensselaerwyck. And this handsome 
booby, staring and sweating, was he her bridegroom?   Martha 
picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began 
to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom. ##

David Cortlandt 
was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh. He had ridden 
hard from Boston, and he was not used to horseback. Now, driving the 
horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler, he felt as if every 
bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve 
into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move.

The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees, 
and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls 
and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood 
memories. He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse 
and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole and came out with 
a jolt and went on. He would cross to Manhattan, to Harlem Heights, 
before morning. There a certain farmhouse was a station for the 
Sons of Liberty. He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches 
with their electrifying news. And he would sleep, sleep, and never 
think of roads and horses' sore haunches, of colonial wars. 
Strange how everything here fitted back into his life, even if he had 
been away so long. Mynheer, Sir Francis, the valley society, the very 
smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish 
weirs and rocks, and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road. A 
mist was walking on the water, white as cotton, but with a blending 
and merging grace.   Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement 
at a crossroads. David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags 
at his feet. He pulled out one of them and cocked it. A strange 
wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes. It was 
a grotesque hen, five or six feet tall. It had the features of a man 
bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers. It ran, this apocalyptic beast, 
on two thin legs, and its wings- were they feathered arms?- 
flapped as it ran. Its groin was bloody. Black strips of skin hung 
from it.   The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its 
nostrils. David took a firm hand with it. The creature in feathers 
looked around and David saw the mad eyes, glazed with an insane fear. 
The ungainly bird thing ran away, and to David its croaking sounded 
like the crowing of a tormented rooster. Then it was gone. He drove 
on, wary and shaken. The Sons were out tonight. 

#CHAPTER 10#

New 
York lay bleaching in the summer sun, and the morning fish hawk, flying 
in the heated air, saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan 
Island. It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens 
and laid out into pig-infested streets, mostly around the Battery, going 
bravely north to Wall Street, but giving up and becoming fields 
and farms in the region of Harlem Heights. From there it looked across 
at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses, 
estates, and big farms of the original (non-Indian) landowners 
began.   On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent 
hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long 
Island Sound. On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn 
Heights. It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor. 
A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights, and 
behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields. Husbandry 
was bounded by snake-rail fences, and there were grazing cattle. On 
the shores north and south, the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- 
lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier 
of sand, Fire Island.   The morning hawk, hungry for any eatable, 
killable, digestible item, kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships 
that lay off the shores in the bay, sheltered by the Jersey inlets. 
They often threw tidbits overboard. The larger ships were near Paulus 
Hook, already being called, by a few, Jersey City. These were 
the ships of His Majesty's Navy, herding the hulks of the East 
Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists. The 
news of battle on Breed's Hill had already seeped through, and New 
York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress. 
The fish hawk, his wings not moving, circled and glided lower. 
The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him, the sides 
of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black, the bronze 
cannon at the ports. The captain's gig of H&M&S& <Mercury> 
was being rowed to H&M&S& <Neptune>. ##

On shore 
"the freed slaves to despotism"- the town dwellers- watched 
the ships and waited. The <chevaux de frise>, those sharp stakes 
and barriers around the fort at the Battery, pointed to a conflict between 
the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came 
in. Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber; their 
rock paths led down to the Hudson. Below in the open bay facing Manhattan 
was Staten Island, gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind 
which nested farms, cattle barns, and berry thickets. Along Wappinger 
Creek in Dutchess County, past the white church at Fishkill, 
past Verplanck's Point on the east bank of the Hudson, to the white 
salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching 
and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen. 
Today, tomorrow, six months, even perhaps a year **h   The fish 
hawk flew on and was lost from sight. The British ships rolled at 
anchor, sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London. Waited 
for more ships, more lobster-backed infantry, and asked <what> 
was to be done with a war of rebellion? ##

David Cortlandt, having 
slept away a day and a night, came awake in a plank farmhouse on 
the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil. He looked out through windowpanes 
turned a faint violet by sun and weather, looked out at King's 
Bridge toward Westchester. The road seemed animated with a few more 
wagons than usual; a carriage raising up the choking June dust, 
and beyond, in a meadow, a local militia company drilling with muskets, 
Kentuck' rifles, every kind of horse pistol, old sword, or cutlass.

The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David's 
mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his 
kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston. Pensive, introspective, 
he ached. He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper 
people and had slept. Now there was more to do. Orders not written down 
had to be transmitted to the local provincial government. He scratched 
his mosquito-plagued neck.   From the saddlebags, hung on 
a Hitchcock chair, David took out a good English razor, a present from 
John Hunter. He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of 
soap, and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his 
broad leather belt, its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost **h. 
He hoped he was free of self-deception.   Here he was, suddenly 
caught up in the delirium of a war, in the spite and calumny of Whigs 
and Tories. There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon, 
but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war. 
David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion 
was not wholly what it appeared on the surface. He knew that many were 
using it for their own ends. But it did not matter. He stropped the 
razor slowly; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was 
being born. That some men did not want it he could understand. The 
moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers. 
Yet some, like Morris Manderscheid, would bankrupt themselves for 
the new ideas. Unique circumstances would test us all, he decided. Injury 
and ingratitude would occur. No doubt John Hancock would do well 
now; war was a smugglers' heaven. And what of that poor tarred 
and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler's? 
Things like that would increase rather than be done away 
with. One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss 
of nothing. He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability 
of man was a dream. Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows. David 
began to shave with great sweeping strokes.   Time plays an 
essential part in our mortality, and suddenly for no reason he could imagine 
(or admit) the image of Peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable, 
so lusty, so full of nuances of pleasure and joy. He drove sensual 
patterns off, carefully shaving his long upper lip. It is harder, 
he muttered, to meditate on man (or woman) than on God.   David 
finished shaving, washed his face clean of lather, and combed and 
retied his hair. He was proud that he had never worn a wig. More and 
more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder. 
He felt cheerful again, refreshed; presentable in his wide-cut brown 
suit, the well-made riding boots.   It is so easy to falsify 
sentiment **h. In the meadow below, militia officers shouted at their 
men and on King's Bridge two boys sat fishing. The future would 
happen; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much. A man could 
be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days. 
He began to pack the saddlebags. <And all this too shall pass 
away:> it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church 
service when he was a boy- yes, in a white church with a thin spur 
steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley, where a feeling of plenitude 
was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires. 
Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on 
in a primitive way, almost unchanged from feudal times. Peasants puzzled 
Andrei. He wondered how they could go on in poverty, superstition, 
ignorance, with a complete lack of desire to make either their land 
or their lives flourish.   Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting 
long ago. Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine 
and, before the national leadership, exalted the miracles of drying 
up swamps and irrigating the desert. A fund-raising drive to buy tractors 
and machinery was launched. Andrei remembered that his own reaction 
had been one of indifference.   Had he found the meaning too 
late? It aggravated him. The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich, 
but no one seemed to care. In the unfertile land in Palestine humans 
broke their backs pushing will power to the brink.   He had 
sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists. 
All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified 
ideologies, and each berated the other and beat his breast for 
his own approaches. When Alexander Brandel rose to speak, the hall 
became silent.   "I do not care if your beliefs take you along 
a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism. We are 
here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest, 
seeking human dignity. Beyond the forest all our paths merge into 
a single great highway which ends in the barren, eroded hills of Judea. 
This is our singular goal. How we travel through the forest is for 
each man's conscience. Where we end our journey is always the same. 
We all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this 
long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses 
which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over 
Zion". This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism. 
It had sounded good to Andrei, but he did not believe it. In his 
heart he had no desire to go to Palestine. He loathed the idea of 
drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright.

Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex, "I 
only want to be a Pole. Warsaw is my city, not Tel Aviv".

And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered 
if he was not being punished for his lack of belief. Warsaw! He 
saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief, Roman, and all the 
Romans and 
the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him. They had let 
this black hole of death in Warsaw's heart exist without a cry of 
protest.   Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys 
bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they flirted from behind their 
fans.   Warsaw! Warsaw!   "Miss Rak. I am a 
Jew".   Day by day, week by week, month by month, the betrayal 
gnawed at Andrei's heart. He ground his teeth together. I hate 
Warsaw, he said to himself. I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers' 
sons of them. All of Poland is a coffin.   The terrible 
vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind. What matters now? 
What is beyond this fog? Only Palestine, and I will never live to 
see Palestine because I did not believe.   By late afternoon 
the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin, 
which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war 
to the Russian front.   At a siding, another train which was a 
familiar sight these days. Deportees. Jews. Andrei's skilled eye 
sized them up. They were not Poles. He guessed by their appearance 
that they were Rumanians.   He walked toward the center of the 
city to keep his rendezvous with Styka. Of all the places in Poland, 
Andrei hated Lublin the most. The Bathyrans were all gone. Few 
of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto.

From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point. 
He and Ana watched it carefully. Lublin generally was the forerunner 
of what would happen elsewhere. Early in 1939, Odilo Globocnik, 
the Gauleiter of Vienna, established ~SS headquarters for all 
of Poland. The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to 
conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian 
administrators.   Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps. 
Lublin was the seed of action for the "final solution" of the Jewish 
problem. As the messages from Himmler, Heydrich, and Eichmann 
came in through Alfred Funk, Lublin's fountainhead spouted.

A bevy of interlacing lagers, work camps, concentration camps erupted 
in the area. Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared 
into Lublin's web. Plans went in and out of Lublin, indicating 
German confusion. A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to 
hold several million Jews **h A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to 
the island of Madagascar **h Stories of the depravity of the guards 
at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention 
of their names. Lipowa 7, Sobibor, Chelmno, Poltawa, Belzec, Krzywy-Rog, 
Budzyn, Krasnik. Ice baths, electric shocks, lashings, wild 
dogs, testicle crushers.   The Death's-Head Corps took in 
Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries, and the <Einsatzkommandos> waded 
knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken, dope-ridden maniacs. 
Lublin was their heart.   In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard 
began in Lublin. The ghetto, a miniature of Warsaw's, was emptied 
into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek. 
As the camp emptied, it was refilled by a draining of the camps and 
towns around Lublin, then by deportees from outside Poland. In and 
in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek, but they never 
left, and Majdanek was not growing any larger.   What was happening 
in Majdanek? Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the 
daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw? Was there 
another Majdanek in the Warsaw area, as they suspected?   Andrei 
stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary 
of civil buildings. His watch told him he was still early. Down 
the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall. He found an 
empty bench, opened a newspaper, and stretched his legs before him. 
Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty 
brownish ones of their Auxiliaries.   "Captain 
Androfski"!

Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the 
mustached, homely face of Sergeant Styka. Styka sat beside him and 
pumped his hand excitedly. "I have been waiting across the street 
at the post office since dawn. I thought you might get in on a morning 
train".   "It's good to see you again, Styka".

Styka studied his captain. He almost broke into tears. To him, Andrei 
Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer. 
His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn 
and shabby.   "Remember to call me Jan", Andrei said.

Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously. "When 
that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy 
since before the war".   "I'm lucky that you were still 
living in Lublin".   Styka grumbled about fate. "For a time 
I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces, but one thing 
led to another. I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married. 
Not a bad girl. So we have three children and responsibilities. I 
work at the granary. Nothing like the old days in the army, but I 
get by. Who complains? Many times I tried to reach you, but I never 
knew how. I came to Warsaw twice, but there was that damned ghetto 
wall **h"   "I understand".   Styka blew his nose 
again.   "Were you able to make the arrangements"? Andrei 
asked.   "There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in 
charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek. I did exactly as instructed. 
I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek 
so you can make a report to the government in exile in London".

"His answer"?   "Ten thousand zlotys".

"Can he be trusted"?   "He is aware he will not live 
for twenty-four hours if he betrays you".   "Good man, Styka".

"Captain **h Jan **h must you go inside Majdanek? 
The stories **h Everyone really knows what is happening there".

"Not everyone, Styka".   "What good will it really 
do"?   "I don't know. Perhaps **h perhaps **h there 
is a shred of conscience left in the human race. Perhaps if they know 
the story there will be a massive cry of indignation".   "Do 
you really believe that, Jan"?   "I have to believe it".

Styka shook his head slowly. "I am only a simple soldier. 
I cannot think things out too well. Until I was transferred into 
the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about 
Jews. I hated you when I first came in. But **h my captain might 
have been a Jew, but he wasn't a Jew. What I mean is, he was a 
Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys. Hell, sir. The men of 
our company had a dozen fights defending your name. You never knew about 
it, but by God, we taught them respect for Captain Androfski".

Andrei smiled.   "Since the war I have seen the way 
the Germans have behaved and I think, Holy Mother, we have behaved 
like this for hundreds of years. Why"?   "How can you 
tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see"?   "But 
we are neither blind nor insane. The men of your company would not 
allow your name dishonored. Why do we let the Germans do this"?

"I have sat many hours with this, Styka. All I ever wanted 
was to be a free man in my own country. I've lost faith, Styka. 
I used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our 
battle for equality. But now I think I hate it very much". 
"And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care 
any more than we do"?   The question frightened Andrei.

"Please don't go inside Majdanek".   "I'm still 
a soldier in a very small way, Styka".   It was an answer that 
Styka understood.   Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge 
over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center. Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated 
undershirt, cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy 
stillness before sundown. He was a square brick of a man with a 
moon-round face and sunken Polish features. Flies swarmed around the 
bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread. Half of it dripped 
down his chin. He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated 
belch.   "Well"? Andrei demanded.   Grabski 
looked at the pair of them. He grunted a sort of "yes" answer. "My 
cousin works at the Labor Bureau. He can make you work papers. 
It will take a few days. I will get you inside the guard camp as a 
member of my crew. I don't know if I can get you into the inner camp. 
Maybe yes, maybe no, but you can observe everything from the roof 
of a barrack we are building".   Grabski slurped his way to the 
bottom of the soup bowl. "Can't understand why the hell anyone 
wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place".   "Orders from 
the Home Army".   "Why? Nothing there but Jews".

Andrei shrugged. "We get strange orders".   "Well- 
what about the money"?   Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty 
notes. Grabski had never seen so much money. His broad flat 
fingers, petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying, snatched 
the bills clumsily. "This ain't enough".   "You 
get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek".   "I ain't 
taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business".   Andrei 
and Styka were silent.

She was getting real dramatic. I'd have been more impressed 
if I hadn't remembered that she'd played Hedda Gabler in her 
highschool dramatics course. I didn't want her back on that broken 
record.   "Nothing's free in the whole goddam world", was 
all I could think of to say. When I'd delivered myself of that 
gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink.   "I 
am", she said.   I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky 
Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending. 
It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in 
the old days, and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my 
hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was 
so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch. Drunk 
or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me. I was 
crazy about her all over again. It was the call of the wild all right.

That evening turned out to be hell like all the others. We 
moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill. It was the same old routine. 
Eileen got to dancing, just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed 
tune that you could hardly notice, and trying to pick up strange 
men, but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd 
pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet 
husky voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together 
and there I was back on the hook.   I did have the decency to 
call up Thelma and tell her I'd met old friends and would be home 
late.   "I could scratch her eyes out", Eileen cried and stamped 
her foot when I came back from the phone booth. "You know I 
don't like my men to have other women. I hate it. I hate it".

She got so drunk I had to take her home. It was a walk up on 
Hudson Street. She just about made me carry her upstairs and then 
she clung to me and wouldn't let me go.   There was a man's 
jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table. The place smelt of 
some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use. "What about 
Ballestre"? I had to shake her to make her listen. "Precious. 
What about him"?   Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic. 
"Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom. We are 
above being jealous. He's used to me bringing home strange men. I'll 
just tell him you're my husband. He can't object to that".

"Well I object. If he pokes his nose in here I'll slug 
him".   "That really would be funny".   She began 
to laugh. She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling 
her on the bed. After all I'm made of flesh and blood. I'm 
not a plaster saint.   Waking up was horrible. Never in my life 
have I felt so remorseful about anything I've done as I did about 
spending that night with my own wife.   We both had hangovers. 
Eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow. She 
lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling 
me where to look for the coffeepot. I was stumbling in my undershirt 
trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that 
sickish sweet hairtonic smell. There was somebody else in the apartment.

I stiffened. Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the 
back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight. I 
turned around with the percolator in my hand. My eyes were so bleary 
I could barely see him but there he was, a little smooth olivefaced 
guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora. Brown eyes, 
eyebrow mustache. Oval face without an expression in the world.

We didn't have time to speak before Eileen's voice was screeching 
at us from the bed. "Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier 
Bowman. Exboyfriend meet exhusband". She gave the nastiest laugh 
I ever heard. "And don't either of you forget that I'm not 
any man's property. If you want to fight, go down on the sidewalk". 
She was enjoying the situation. Imagine that.   Eileen 
was a psychologist all right. Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard 
I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him. Maybe he felt the 
same way. I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life. First thing 
I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was 
handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a 
queen among her courtiers.   I couldn't face Thelma after that 
night. I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone. 
I wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved 
too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express. Of 
course I had to give her Eileen's address, but she never came near 
us. All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was 
beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and 
it was goodbye forever. She never said a word about the fifty dollars. 
She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking. I 
must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times.

Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone 
and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband 
away. That finished me with Thelma. Trust Eileen to squeeze all the 
drama out of a situation.   And there I was shacked up with Eileen 
in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street. I use the 
phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about 
our relationship. I felt it and it ate on me all the time, but I 
didn't know how right I was till later.   What I did know was 
that Precious was always around. He slept in the hall bedroom at the 
head of the stairs. "Who do you think pays the rent? You wouldn't 
have me throw the poor boy out on the street", Eileen said when 
I needled her about it. I said sure that was what I wanted her 
to do but she paid no attention. Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening 
to things she didn't want to hear. Still I didn't think 
she was twotiming me with Precious right then. To be on the safe side 
I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night.   Precious 
had me worried. I couldn't make out what his racket was. I'd 
thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be. He was smooth 
and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under 
his selfeffacing manner. Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet. 
Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious 
who did the work.   I never could find out what his business was. 
He always seemed to have money in his pocket. The phone had been 
disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger. 
Now and then he would disappear for several days. "Connections" 
was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading 
questions. "Oh he's just an international spy", Eileen would 
shout with her screechy laugh.   Poor devil he can't have been 
too happy either. He got no relief from drink because, though sometimes 
Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the 
evening, he'd leave it on the table untouched.   When I was in 
liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess. Occasionally if I pushed 
him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel 
bony skull would show through that smooth face of his. "Some day", 
I told Eileen, "that guy will kill us both". She just wouldn't 
listen.   Getting drunk every night was the only way I 
could handle the situation. Eileen seemed to feel the same way. We still 
had that much in common. The trouble was drinking cost money. The 
way Eileen and I were hitting it up, we needed ten or fifteen dollars 
an evening. Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious. 
I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from 
my respectable uptown life, but when that was gone I didn't have a 
cent. I don't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't 
come to town.   Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim. 
He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have 
Jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm. He was a big 
thick beefy violent man. Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly, 
but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little 
sister. Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them 
stick 
together in spite of politics and everything.   Pat took Eileen 
and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears 
in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again. "Whom God 
hath joined" etcetera. The O'Dwyers were real religious people 
except for Kate. Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl 
out of mischief. Pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost 
her job on that fashion magazine. It had gone big with the Hollywood 
girls when he told them his sister was an editor of <Art and Apparel>. 
How about me trying to help her get her job back?   All 
evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready 
for her first communion. It just about blew us both out of the water 
when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with. "But brother 
I can't take a job right now", she said with her eyes on her 
ice cream, "I'm going to have a baby, Francis Xavier's baby, 
my own husband's baby".   My first thought was how had it 
happened so soon, but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd 
been living together six weeks. Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with 
sentiment. Greatest thing that ever happened. Now Eileen really 
would have to settle down to love honor and obey, and she'd have to 
quit drinking. He'd come East for the christening, by God he would. 
When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill 
into Eileen's hand to help towards a layette.   Before he left 
town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job. Pat had contacts 
all over the labor movement. A friend of Pat's named Frank Sposato 
had just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union.   The portwatchers 
were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats 
and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves. Most of them were 
elderly men. It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because 
the thieving is awful in the port of New York. They weren't as 
well paid as they should have been. One reason the portwatchers let 
Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen.

Sposato needed a front, some labor stiff with a clean record to 
act as business agent of the Redhook local. There I was a retired 
wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow 
worker in my thirty years in the movement. For once radicalism was 
a recommendation.   Sposato couldn't wait to get me hired. 
With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked 
the honest working stiff. The things a man will do for a woman. 
There was one fact which Rector could not overlook, one truth which 
he could not deny. As long as there were two human beings working together 
on the same project, there would be competition and you could no 
more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave. No matter 
how devoted a man was, no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord, 
he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition 
as an individual. All of the jobs in the mission might be equal 
in the eyes of the Lord, but they were certainly not equal in the 
eyes of the Lord's servants. It was only natural that Fletcher would 
strive for a position in which he could make the decisions.

Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he 
knew it, not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church- 
his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career- 
but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel. He 
was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church 
and how much was his own ego, demanding to be satisfied, for the two 
were intertwined and could not be separated. He wanted desperately 
to see Kayabashi defeated, the Communists in the village rooted out, 
the mission standing triumphant, for in the triumph of the Lord he 
himself would be triumphant, too. But perhaps this was a part of the 
eternal plan, that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving, 
indefatigable force for good in the world.   He sighed. 
How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith 
would suffice. He would have to work without questioning the motives 
which made him work and content himself with the thought that the 
eventual victory, however it was brought about, would be sweet indeed.

His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days. 
His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough 
of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or 
whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print 
shop, using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse. In any event Rector 
sent him to the local hospital to have it checked, telling him to 
keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find 
out what Kayabashi was planning.   Hino was elated at the prospect. 
He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital 
and he was given some extra money to go to the <pachinko> parlor- 
an excellent place to make contact with the enemy. He left with all 
the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday, nodding attentively 
as Rector gave him his final instructions. He was to get involved in 
no 
arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen 
and report back what he heard.   It was a ridiculous situation 
and Rector knew it, for Hino, frankly partisan, openly gregarious, 
would make a poor espionage agent. If he wanted to know anything, he 
would end up asking about it point-blank, but in this guileless manner 
he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to 
get them by indirection. In all of his experience in the mission field 
Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino. From the moment 
that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job, any job- 
his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise 
hand- he had been ready to become a Christian. He had already been 
studying the Bible; he knew the fundamentals, and after studying 
with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector, announced that he wanted 
to be baptized and that was that.   Rector had never been able 
to find out much about Hino's past. Hino talked very little about 
himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration 
in connection with another subject. Putting the pieces of 
this mosaic together, Rector had the vague outlines of a biography. Hino 
was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast, in 
Chiba, and divided his life between the land and the sea, supplementing 
the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment 
on a fishing boat. Without exception Hino's brothers turned 
to either one or both of their father's occupations, but Hino showed 
a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach 
where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller. 
He had gone into the Japanese navy, had been trained as an officer, 
had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail 
regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five, 
quite as a bolt out of the blue, he had walked into the mission as if 
he belonged here and had become a Christian. Rector was often curious; 
often tempted to ask questions but he never did. If and when Hino 
decided to tell him about his experiences, he would do so unasked.

Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village 
bursting with information, ready to impart it with his customary gusto, 
liberally embellished with his active imagnation. When the telephone 
rang on the day after Hino went down to the village, Rector had 
a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important 
to wait until his return, for there were few telephones in the village 
and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important. 
He was surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other 
end of the line. He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi 
wanted. The <oyabun> was entertaining a group of dignitaries, the 
secretary said, businessmen from Tokyo for the most part, and Kayabashi 
wished to show them the mission. They had never seen one before 
and had expressed a curiosity about it.   "Oh"? Rector 
said. "I guess it will be all right. When would the <oyabun> like 
to bring his guests up here"?   "This afternoon", the 
secretary said. "At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to 
you at that time".   "All right", Rector said. "I will 
be expecting them".   He was about to hang up the phone, but 
a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation 
open. He had something more to say. "I beg to inquire if the back 
is now safe for travelers", he said.   Rector laughed despite 
himself. "Unless the <oyabun> has been working on it", he said, 
then checked himself and added: "You can tell Kayabashi-<san> 
that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for 
his party to use".   "<Arigato gosaimasu>". The secretary 
sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector's 
hand.   Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission. 
For the <oyabun> to make such a trip was either a sign of great 
weakness or an indication of equally great confidence, and from all 
the available information it was probably the latter. Kayabashi must 
feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this, 
a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the 
village. 
At the same time, it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend 
a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity. No, Kayabashi 
was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector 
would not be able to fathom it until they arrived.   When he had 
given the call a few moments thought, he went into the kitchen to ask 
Mrs& Yamata to prepare tea and <sushi> for the visitors, using 
the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been 
donated to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the grounds. Fujimoto 
had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn. Rector asked 
him to move it for the time being; he wanted the mission compound 
to be effortlessly spotless. A good initial impression would be important 
now. He went into the print shop, where Fletcher had just finished 
cleaning the press.   "How many pamphlets do we have in stock"? 
Rector said.   "I should say about a hundred thousand", 
Fletcher said. "Why"?   "I would like to enact 
a little tableau this afternoon", Rector said, He explained about 
the visit and the effect he wished to create, the picture of a very busy 
mission. He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly, just to display 
the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner. Fletcher 
nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange 
the things Rector requested.   Rector's next stop was at 
the schoolroom, where Mavis was monitoring a test. He beckoned to her 
from the door and she slipped quietly outside. He told her of the visitors 
and then of his plans. "How many children do you have present 
today"? he said.   She looked back toward the schoolroom. 
"Fifteen", she said. "No, only fourteen. The little Ito girl 
had to go home. She has a pretty bad cold".   "I would 
like them to appear very busy today, not busy exactly, but joyous, exuberant, 
full of life. I want to create the impression of a compound 
full of children. Do you think you can manage it"?   Mavis 
smiled. "I'll try".   As Rector was walking back toward 
the residential hall, Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up 
to him. The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen 
his spirits, but he was still a little wary around Rector for they 
had not yet discussed the incident. "I think I've fixed the pump 
so we won't have to worry about it for a long time", he said. "I've 
adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water 
gets too low".   "Fine", Rector said. He looked out over 
the expanse of the compound. It was going to take a lot of activity 
to fill it. "Have you ever operated a transit"? he said.

"No, sir", Johnson said.   "You are about to become a 
first-class surveyor", Rector said. "When Konishi gets back with 
the jeep, I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys. Konishi 
can help you. You'll find an old transit in the basement. The 
glass is out of it, but that won't matter. It looks pretty efficient 
and that's the important thing". He went on to explain what he 
had in mind. Johnson nodded. He said he could do it.   Rector 
was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential 
hall. It was rather a childish game, all in all, but everybody 
seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not 
remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much. He was 
not sure what effect it would have, but that was really beside the point 
when you got right down to it. He was not going to lose the mission 
by default, and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little 
sight-seeing group to the mission, he was going to be in for a surprise.

He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make 
sure everything was in order in the residential hall, and then to take 
charge of the office while the party was here. When everything had been 
done, Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly 
report until three o'clock.   At two thirty he sent Fujimoto 
to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to 
keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed 
the approach of Kayabashi's party. Then Rector, attired in his best 
blue serge suit, sat in a chair out on the lawn, in the shade of a 
tree, smoking a cigarette and waiting. The air was cooler here, and the 
lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass, an effect 
which he found pleasant.

She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one 
be inconvenient.   The fish took the bait. He replied that he 
could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with 
a stranger, but- joy of joys, he would be at home at the hour mentioned.

But when she called he had thought better of the matter 
and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement. She was told 
by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged 
on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed. 
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff 
daunt her purpose. She wrote again and now, abandoning for the moment 
the theme of love, she asked for help in the matter of her career. 
She could act and she could write. His lordship was concerned in the 
management of Drury Lane but, if there were no opportunities there, 
would he read and criticize her novel?   At last he consented 
to meet her, and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a 
yet more remarkable proposal:   Have you any objection to the 
following plan? On Thursday evening we may go out of town together 
by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles. There 
we shall be free and unknown; we can return the following morning 
**h   She concluded by asking for a brief interview- "to settle 
with you <where>"- and she threw in a tribute to his "gentle 
manners" and "the wild originality of your countenance".

She opened his reply with trembling fingers **h he agreed! And 
he would see her that evening. Victory at last!   At their 
meeting he told her not to bother about "where"- he would attend 
to that. There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and, as 
Claire 
rose to go, he asked her to sing him one song before she left. 
She sang him Scott's charming ballad "Rosabelle", which was the 
vogue of the moment. She had never sung better.   "Your voice 
is delightful", he approved with a warm smile. "Tomorrow will 
be a new experience- I have never before made love to a nightingale 
**h. There have been cooing doves, chattering magpies, thieving jackdaws, 
a proud peacock, a silly goose, and a harpy eagle- whom I was 
silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals".

And so they went, he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham 
Abbey, scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire 
Club. He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed 
by the cassocked bloods, which he had had at firsthand from old 
Bud Dodington, one of the leaders of the so-called "Order". Each 
wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this, it seems, was not 
employed for self-flagellation **h. Naked girls danced in the chancel 
of the Abbey, the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen 
to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities.   The jaded 
amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish. Alas, 
all that belonged to the age of "Devil Dashwood" and "Wicked 
Wilkes", abbot and beadsman of the Order! The casual seduction 
of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison.

They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate. A scant half mile 
away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace, 
the air about them scented with stock, and listening to the nightingale 
who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden. Charming 
and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure? 
Alone with the fabulous Byron! How many women had longed 
for the privilege that was hers.   How was she to behave, Claire 
wondered. To be passive, to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd. 
She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem. 
And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience, satiety might 
well be an equal handicap. No, she would not pretend modesty, but 
neither must she be crudely bold. Mystery- that was the thing. In 
the bedroom she would insist on darkness. With his club foot he might 
well be grateful.   At the inn, which was situated close to a 
broad weir, Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference 
and addressed as "milord". The place was evidently a familiar 
haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated 
in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown.   The fire 
in the sitting room was lighted.   "What about the bedroom"? 
Byron inquired. "Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed 
out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell".

"We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney, milord, but 
I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again".

So, not only had he been here before, but it seemed he might well 
come again. Claire felt suddenly small and cheap, heroine of a trivial 
episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan.   A cold supper 
was ordered and a bottle of port. When Napoleon's ship had borne 
him to Elba, French wines had started to cross the Channel, the first 
shipments in a dozen war-ridden years, but the supplies had not yet 
reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula 
still ruled.   As they waited for supper they sat by the 
fire, glasses in hand, while Byron philosophized as much for his own 
entertainment as hers.   "Sex is overpriced", he said. "The 
great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate, not 
man against man for the prize of a woman's body. So don't see yourself 
as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major 
importance".   "The gods seemed to think sex pretty important", 
she rebutted. "Mars and Venus, Bacchus and Ariadne, Jupiter 
and Io, Byron and the nymph of the owl's nest. That would be 
Minerva, I suppose. Wasn't the owl her symbol"?   Byron 
laughed. "So you know something of the classics, do you"?

"Tell me about Minerva, how she behaved, what she did to please 
you".   "I'll tell you nothing. I don't ask you who 'tis 
you're being unfaithful to, husband or lover. Frankly, I don't 
care".   For a moment she thought of answering with the truth 
but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity, who demanded 
some 
degree of education in body as well as mind.   "Very well", 
she said, "I'll not catechize you. What matter the others so long 
as I have my place in history".   She was striking the right 
note. No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed, with 
one so favored, flattery could hardly seem overdone. Brains and beauty, 
high position in both the social and intellectual worlds, athlete, 
fabled lover- if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his.

The light supper over, Claire went to him and, slipping an arm 
about his shoulder, sat on his knee. He drew her close and, hand on 
cheek, turned her face to his. Her lips, moist and parted, spoke his 
name.   "Byron"!   His hand went to her shoulder and 
pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown; 
then, to better purpose, he took hold of the knot and with dextrous 
fingers, untied it. The bodice beneath was buttoned and, withdrawing 
his lips from hers, he set her upright on his knee and started to 
undo it, unhurriedly as if she were a child.   But, kindled by 
his kiss, his caressing hand, her desire was aflame. She sprang up and 
went swiftly to the bedroom. Lord Byron poured himself another glass 
of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color. 
He drank slowly with due appreciation. It was an excellent vintage.

He rose and went to the bedroom. Pausing in the doorway he said: 
"The form of the human female, unlike her mind and her spirit, 
is the most challenging loveliness in all nature". ##

When Claire 
returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become 
Byron's mistress. By odd coincidence, on the evening of her return 
Shelley chose to read <Parisina>, which was the latest of the titled 
poet's successes. As he declaimed the sonorous measures, it was 
as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with 
her dramatic tidings.   "Although it is not the best of which 
he is capable", said Shelley as he closed the book, "it is still 
poetry of a high order".   "If he would only leave the East", 
said Mary. "I am tired of sultans and scimitars". 
"The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte", said Claire, 
with slightly overdone carelessness.   "How do you know that"? 
demanded Mary.   "I was told it on good authority", 
Claire answered darkly. "I mustn't tell, I mustn't tell", 
she repeated to herself. "I promised him I wouldn't". 

#CHAPTER 
9#

WINTER CAME, and with it Mary's baby- a boy as she 
had wished. William, he was called, in honor of the man who was at once 
Shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor. With a pardonable 
irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his 
daughter:   "Fanny and Mrs& Godwin will probably be glad 
to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement, 
and that her child is well".   At the same time another 
child- this one of Shelley's brain- was given to the world: 
<Alastor>, a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze 
into the still depths of a fine mind's musings. <Alastor> was published 
only to be savagely attacked, contemptuously ignored. Shelley 
sent a copy to Southey, a former friend, and another to Godwin. Neither 
acknowledged the gift.   Only Mary's praise sustained him 
in his disappointment. She understood completely. Not a thought nor 
a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation.   "You 
have made the labor worth while", he said to her, smiling. "And in 
the future, since I write for a public of one, I can save the poor 
publishers from wasting their money".   "A public of one", 
Mary echoed reprovingly. "how can you say such a thing? There 
will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of <Alastor>. There 
are some even now. What about that dear, clever Mr& Thynne? 
I am sure he is in raptures".   "Poor Mr& Thynne, he 
always has to be trotted out for my encouragement".   "There 
are other Mr& Thynnes. Not everyone is bewitched by Byron's 
caliphs and harem beauties".   Mary's supercritical attitude 
toward Byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute. She was resentful 
of his easy success as compared with Shelley's failure. The 
same 
month that <Alastor> was published, Murray sold twenty thousand 
copies of <The Siege of Corinth>, a slovenly bit of Byronism that 
even Shelley's generosity rebelled at. ##

The lordly poet was 
at low-water mark. The careless writing was in keeping with his mood 
of savage discontent. On all sides doors were being slammed in his 
face. The previous scandals, gaily diverting as they were, had only 
served to increase his popularity. Now, under the impact of his wife's 
disclosures, he was brought suddenly to the realization that there 
was a limit to tolerance, however brilliant, however far-famed the offender 
might be. He tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion 
to his half sister, but he soon saw, as did she, that this course if persisted 
in would involve them in a common ruin. For the moment there 
was no woman in his life, and it was this vacuum that had given Claire 
her opportunity.   But the liaison successfully started in the 
last days of autumn was now languishing. Byron, since the separation 
from his wife had been living in a smallish house in Piccadilly Terrace. 
He refused to bring Claire to it even as an occasional visitor, 
claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the Milbankes.

Beckworth handed the pass to the colonel. He had thought that 
the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction 
of serving his own order, but the slip of paper was folded and absently 
thrust into the colonel's belt. Despite his yearning, the colonel 
would not go down to see the men come through the lines. He would 
remain in the tent, waiting impatiently, occupied by some trivial 
task.   -Beckworth.   -Sir?   -Fetch me the 
copies of everything ~B and ~C companies have requisitioned in the 
last 
six months.   -The last <six> months, sir?   -You 
heard me. There's a lot of waste going on here. It's got to stop. 
I want to take a look. This is no damned holiday, Beckworth. Get 
busy.   -Yes, sir.   Beckworth left the tent. Below 
he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank. He glanced back. 
The colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs, methodically 
tearing at his thumbnail. #@ 9 @#

THE BOMBPROOF was 
a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth. It 
stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank. From the outside, it 
seemed no more than a low drumlin, a lump on the dark earth. A crude 
ladder ran down to a wooden floor. Two slits enabled observers to watch 
across the river. The place smelled strongly of rank, fertile earth, 
rotting wood and urine. The plank floor was slimed beneath Watson's 
boots. At least the Union officer had been decent enough to provide 
a candle. There was no place to sit, but Watson walked slowly 
from the ladder to the window slits and back, stooping slightly to avoid 
striking his head on the heavy beams. In the corner was the soldier 
with the white flag. He stood stiffly erect, clutching the staff, his 
body half hidden by the limp cloth. Watson hardly looked at him. The 
man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last 
instant, brandishing the flag of truce. Someone had hauled him over 
the side, and he had remained silent while they crossed.   An officer 
with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank. The men in the 
boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer, two 
of them calling him Billy. When the boat had touched, the weaker ones 
and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the 
soldiers. Watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof. 
The officer had told him that both lists must be checked. Watson 
had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass. The officer, surprised, 
said he would have to see. Watson had nodded absently and muttered 
that he would check the lists himself later. He had peered through 
the darkness at the rampart. The men he would take back across 
the river stood there, but he turned away from them. He wanted no part 
of the emotions of the exchange, no memory of the joy and gratitude 
that other men felt. He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof, but the 
soldier had followed him. Though Watson carefully ignored the man, 
he could not deny his presence. Perhaps it would be better to speak 
to him, since silence could not exorcise his form. Watson glanced briefly 
at him, seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner.

-We won't be too long. If my pass is approved, I may 
be a half hour.   The soldier answered in a curious, muffled voice, 
his lips barely moving. Watson turned away and did not see the man's 
knees buckle and his body sag.   -Yes, sir.   He 
had acknowledged the man. It was easier to think now, Watson decided. 
The stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts. He 
paced slowly, stooping, staring at the damp, slippery floor. He tried 
to order the words of the three Union officers, seeking to create some 
coherent portrait of the dead boy. But he groped blindly. His lack 
of success steadily eroded his interest. He stopped pacing, leaned 
against the dank, timbered wall and let his mind drift. A feeling of 
futility, an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known, 
seeped through him. What in the name of God was he doing, crouched 
in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river? Why had he crossed 
the dark water, to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or 
to skulk in a foul-smelling hole?   He grew annoyed and at the 
same time surprised at that emotion. He was conscious of a growing sense 
of absurdity. Hillman had written it all out, hadn't he? Wasn't 
the report official enough? What did he hope to accomplish here? 
Hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank. Prompted by 
a guilty urge, he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected. For 
what? To tell John something he would find out for himself.

The figure in the corner belched loudly, a deep, liquid eruption. Watson 
snorted and then laughed aloud. Exactly!   The soldier's 
voice was muffled again, stricken with chagrin. He clutched the 
staff, 
and his dark eyes blinked apologetically.   -'Scuse me, 
sir.   -Let's get out of here.   Watson ran up the ladder 
and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud 
and river weeds. To his left, the two skiffs dented their sharp bows 
into the soft bank. The flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull 
of the current. A soldier held the end of a frayed rope.   Three 
Union guards appeared, carrying their rifles at ready. Watson stared 
at them 
curiously. They were stocky men, well fed and clean-shaven, with 
neat uniforms and sturdy boots. Behind them shambled a long column of 
weak, tattered men. The thin gray figures raised a hoarse, cawing cry 
like the call of a bird flock. They moved toward the skiffs with shocking 
eagerness, elbowing and shoving. Four men were knocked down, but 
did not attempt to rise. They crept down the muddy slope toward the 
waiting boats. The Union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy, 
indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs. 
The crawling men tried to rise and fell again. No one moved to them. 
Watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened 
to their voices beg shrilly. In a confused, soaked and stumbling 
shift of bodies and lifting arms, the two men were dragged into the 
same skiff. The third crawling man forced himself erect. He swayed 
like a drunkard, his arms milling in slow circles. He paced forward unsteadily, 
leaning too far back, his head tilted oddly. His steps were 
short and stiff, and, with his head thrown back, his progress was a 
supercilious strut. He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose 
at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom. He 
stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed 
barge, his weight nearly swamping the craft. Watson looked for 
the fourth man. He had reached the three passive guards; he crept 
in an incertain manner, patting the ground before him. The guards did 
not look at him. The figure on the earth halted, seemingly bewildered. 
He sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound. Then he began 
to crawl again. Watson watched the creeping figure. He felt a spectator 
interest. Would the man make it or not? If only there was a 
clock for him to crawl against. If he failed to reach the riverbank 
in five minutes, say, then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping 
in the mud. Say three minutes to make it sporting. Still the guards 
did not move, but stood inert, aloof from the slow-scrambling man. 
The figure halted, and Watson gasped. The man began to creep in 
the wrong direction, deceived by a slight rise in the ground! He turned 
slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart. Watson 
raced for him, his boots slamming the soft earth.   The guards 
came to life with astonishing menace. They spun and flung their rifles 
up. Watson gesticulated wildly. One man dropped to his knee for 
better aim.   -Let me help him, for the love of God!

The guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at Watson 
with sullen, puzzled faces. Watson pounded to the crawling man and 
stopped, panting heavily. He reached down and closed his fingers on 
the man's upper arm. Beneath his clutch, a flat strip of muscle surged 
on the bone. Watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet. 
Watson stared into a cadaverous face. Two clotted balls the color 
of mucus rolled between fiery lids. Light sticks of fingers, the tips 
gummy with dark earth, patted at Watson's throat. The man's voice 
was a sweet, patient whisper.   -Henry said that he'd take 
my arm and get me right there. But you ain't Henry.   -No.

-It don't matter. Is it far?   How far could 
it be, Watson thought bleakly, how far can a blind man crawl? Another 
body length or all the rest of his nighted life?   -Not 
far.   -You talk deep. Not like us fellas. It raises the voice, 
bein in camp. You Secesh?   -Yes. Come on, now. Can 
you walk?   -Why, course I can. I can walk real good.

Watson stumbled down the bank. The man leaned his frail body 
against Watson's shoulder. He was no heavier than a child. Watson 
paused for breath. The man wheezed weakly, his fetid breath beating 
softly against Watson's neck. His sweet whisper came after great effort.

-Oh, Christ **h. I wish you was Henry **h. He promised 
to take me.   -Hush. We're almost there.   Watson 
supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure 
over the bow of the nearest skiff. The man swayed on a thwart, turning 
his ruined eyes from side to side. Watson turned away, sickened for 
the first time in many months. He heard the patient voice calling.

-Henry? Where are you, Henry?   -Make him lie 
down!   Watson snatched a deep breath. He had not meant to shout. 
He stood with his back to the skiff. The men mewed and scratched, 
begging to be taken away. Watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night 
flecked with pine-knot torches.   -<Goddamn you! What 
do you do to them?>   Intelligence jabbed at him accusingly. 
He was angry, sickened. He had not felt that during the afternoon. 
No, nor later. All his emotions had been inward, self-conscious. In 
war, on a night like this, it was only the outward emotions that mattered, 
what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others. Yes. 
That was it. He was sure of it.   John's type of man allowed 
this sort of thing to happen. What a fool he had been to think of 
his brother! So Charles was dead. What did it matter? His name 
had been crossed off a list. Already his cool body lay in the ground. 
What words had any meaning? What had he thought of, to go to John, 
grovel and beg understanding? To confess with a canvas chair as 
a <prie-dieu>, gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade 
him rise and go? Men were slaughtered every day, tumbled into eternity 
like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute. What made 
him think John had a right to witness his brother's humiliation? 
What right had John to any special consideration? Was John better, 
more deserving? To hell with John. Let him chafe with impatience 
to see Charles, rip open the note with trembling hands and read 
the formal report in Hillman's beautiful, schoolmaster's hand. John 
would curse. He believed that brave boys didn't cry.   Watson 
spat on the ground. He was grimly satisfied. He had stupidly thought 
himself compelled to ease his brother's pain. Now he knew perfectly 
that he had but longed to increase his own suffering.

I WOULD not want to be one of those writers who begin each 
morning 
by exclaiming, "O Gogol, O Chekhov, O Thackeray and Dickens, 
what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four 
plaster-of-Paris ducks, 
a birdbath, and three composition gnomes with 
long beards and red mobcaps"? As I say, I wouldn't want to 
begin a day like this, but I often wonder what the dead would have done. 
But the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and 
horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge. I can see it from this 
window where I write. It was built by the Pasterns, and stands on 
the acre of ground that adjoins our property. It bulks under a veil of 
thin, new grass, like some embarrassing fact of physicalness, and I 
think Mrs& Pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning. It 
would have been like her. She was a pale woman. Sitting on her terrace, 
sitting in her parlor, sitting anywhere, she ground an axe of self-esteem. 
Offer her a cup of tea and she would say, "Why, these cups 
look just like a set I gave to the Salvation Army last year". 
Show her the new swimming pool and she would say, slapping her ankle, 
"I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes". 
Hand her a chair and she would say, "Why, it's a nice imitation 
of those Queen Anne chairs I inherited from Grandmother Delancy". 
These trumps were more touching than they were anything else, 
and seemed to imply that the nights were long, her children ungrateful, 
and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare. Twenty years ago, she would 
have been known as a golf widow, and the sum of her manner was perhaps 
one of bereavement. She usually wore weeds, and a stranger watching 
her board a train might have guessed that Mr& Pastern was dead, 
but Mr& Pastern was far from dead. He was marching up and down 
the locker room of the Grassy Brae Golf Club shouting, "Bomb Cuba! 
Bomb Berlin! Let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them 
and show them who's boss". He was brigadier of the club's locker-room 
light infantry, and at one time or another declared war on Russia, 
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and China.   It all began 
on an autumn afternoon- and who, after all these centuries, can describe 
the fineness of an autumn day? One might pretend never to have 
seen one before, or, to more purpose, that there would never be another 
like it. The clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like 
a climax of the year's lights. Leaves were burning somewhere and 
the smoke smelled, for all its ammoniac acidity, of beginnings. The 
boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum. 
Leaving her house one late afternoon, Mrs& Pastern stopped to 
admire the October light. It was the day to canvass for infectious 
hepatitis. Mrs& Pastern had been given sixteen names, a bundle of 
literature, and a printed book of receipts. It was her work to go among 
her neighbors and collect their checks. Her house stood on a rise 
of ground, and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below. 
Charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal, and almost every 
roof she saw signified charity. Mrs& Balcolm worked for the brain. 
Mrs& Ten Eyke did mental health. Mrs& Trenchard worked for 
the blind. Mrs& Horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose 
and throat. Mrs& Trempler was tuberculosis, Mrs& Surcliffe was 
Mothers' March of Dimes, Mrs& Craven was cancer, and Mrs& 
Gilkson did the kidney. Mrs& Hewlitt led the birthcontrol league, 
Mrs& 
Ryerson was arthritis, and way in the distance could be seen the slate 
roof of Ethel Littleton's house, a roof that signified gout.

Mrs& Pastern undertook the work of going from house to house 
with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer. 
It was her destiny; it was her life. Her mother had done it before 
her, and even her old grandmother, who had collected money for smallpox 
and unwed mothers. Mrs& Pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors 
in advance, and most of them were ready for her. She experienced 
none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias. Here 
and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry. The contributions 
were ahead of what she had got the previous year, and while 
the money, of course, was not hers, it excited her to stuff her kit 
with big checks. She stopped at the Surcliffes' after dusk, and had 
a Scotch-and-soda. She stayed too late, and when she left, it was 
dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband. "I got a 
hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund", she said excitedly 
when he walked in. "I did everybody on my list but the Blevins 
and the Flannagans. I want to get my kit in tomorrow morning- would 
you mind doing them while I cook the dinner"?   "But I 
don't know the Flannagans", Charlie Pastern said.   "Nobody 
does, but they gave me ten last year".   He was tired, he 
had his business worries, and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops 
in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day. He 
was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the 
Blevins', thinking that they might give him a drink. But the Blevins 
were away; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and 
shut the door. Turning in at the Flannagans' driveway, he tried 
to remember if he had ever met them. The name encouraged him, because 
he always felt that he could <handle> the Irish. There was a glass 
pane in the front door, and through this he could see into a hallway 
where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers.   "Infectious 
hepatitis", he shouted heartily.   She took a good look 
at herself in the mirror before she turned and, walking with very 
small steps, started toward the door. "Oh, please come in", she said. 
The girlish voice was nearly a whisper. She was not a girl, he 
could see. Her hair was dyed, and her bloom was fading, and she must 
have been crowding forty, but she seemed to be one of those women who 
cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight. "Your wife 
just called", she said, separating one word from another, exactly 
like a child. "And I am not sure that I have any cash- any <money>, 
that is- but if you will wait just a minute I will write you 
out a check if I can find my checkbook. Won't you step into the 
living room, where it's cozier"?   A fire had just been lighted, 
he saw, and things had been set out for drinks, and, like any 
stray, his response to these comforts was instantaneous. Where was <Mr>& 
Flannagan, he wondered. Travelling home on a late train? 
Changing his clothes upstairs? Taking a shower? At the end of the 
room there was a desk heaped with papers, and she began to riffle these, 
making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation. "I am terribly 
sorry to keep you waiting", she said, "but won't you make 
yourself a little drink while you wait? Everything's on the table".

"What train does Mr& Flannagan come out on"?

"Mr& Flannagan is away", she said. Her voice dropped. 
"Mr& Flannagan has been away for six weeks **h".   "I'll 
have a drink, then, if you'll have one with me".   "If 
you will promise to make it weak".   "Sit down", he said, 
"and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later. The only 
way to find things is to relax".   All in all, they had six drinks. 
She described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly. Mr& 
Flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors. He travelled 
all over the world. She didn't like to travel. Planes made her feel 
faint, and in Tokyo, where she had gone that summer, she had been given 
raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home. She and 
her husband had formerly lived in New York, where she had many friends, 
but Mr& Flannagan thought the country would be safer in case 
of war. She would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom. 
She had no children; she had made no friends. "I've seen 
you, though, before", she said with enormous coyness, patting his 
knee. "I've seen you walking your dogs on Sunday and driving by 
in the convertible **h".   The thought of this lonely woman sitting 
at her window touched him, although he was even more touched by 
her plumpness. Sheer plumpness, he knew, is not a vital part of the 
body and has no procreative functions. It serves merely as an excess 
cushion for the rest of the carcass. And knowing its humble place in 
the scale of things, why did he, at this time of life, seem almost ready 
to sell his soul for plumpness? The remarks she made about the sufferings 
of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't 
know what to make of them, but after the sixth drink he put his arm around 
her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook 
there.   "I've never done this before", she said later, 
when he was arranging himself to leave. Her voice shook with feeling, 
and he thought it lovely. He didn't doubt her truthfulness, although 
he had heard the words a hundred times. "I've never done this 
before", they always said, shaking their dresses down over their white 
shoulders. "I've never done this before", they always said, 
waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor. "I've never done 
this before", they always said, pouring another whiskey. "I've 
never done this before", they always said, putting on their stockings. 
On ships at sea, on railroad trains, in summer hotels with mountain views, 
they always said, "I've never done this before". ##

"Where 
have you been"? Mrs& Pastern asked sadly, when he came 
in. "It's after eleven".   "I had a drink with the Flannagans".

"She told me he was in Germany".   "He 
came home unexpectedly".   Charlie ate some supper in the 
kitchen and went into the ~TV room to hear the news. "Bomb them"! 
he shouted. "Throw a little nuclear hardware at them! Show 
them who's boss"! But in bed he had trouble sleeping. He thought 
first of his son and daughter, away at college. He loved them. 
It was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known. Then he 
played nine imaginary holes of golf, choosing his handicap, his irons, 
his stance, his opponents, and his weather in detail, but the green of 
the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries. His money 
was tied up in a Nassau hotel, an Ohio pottery works, and a detergent 
for window-washing, and luck had been running against him. His 
worries harried him up out of bed, and he lighted a cigarette and went 
to the window. In the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their 
leaves. During the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses 
at the track, and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel 
tickets would still be lying, like leaves, in the gutters near Belmont 
and Saratoga. Maple and ash, beech and elm, one hundred to win on 
Three in the fourth, fifty to win on Six in the third, one hundred 
to win on Two in the eighth. Children walking home from school would 
scuff through what seemed to be his foliage. Then, getting back into 
bed, he thought unashamedly of Mrs& Flannagan, planning where they 
would next meet and what they would do. There are, he thought, so few 
true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the 
medicine even when the medicine seemed, as it did, a little crude? 
It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been 
to see her for ten years, not since their last journey eastward to witness 
their Uncle Izaak being lowered into the rocky soil; that aside 
from due notification of certain major events in their lives (two marriages, 
two births, one divorce), Christmas and Easter cards of the 
traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through 
the widowed years. Her thoughts were not discrete. But there was 
a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons.   She 
grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright, like a bird 
alert for flight. She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the 
dainty-legged escritoire, warped and cracked now from fifty years in 
an atmosphere of sea spray. There she extracted two limp vellum sheets 
and wrote off the letters, one to Abel, one to Mark.   Once 
her trembling hand, with the pen grasped tight in it, was pressed against 
the paper the words came sharply, smoothly, as authoritatively as 
they would dropping from her own lips. And the stiffly regal look of 
them, she saw grimly, lacked the quaver of age which, thwarting the efforts 
of her amazing will, ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged 
string. "Please come down as soon as you conveniently can", 
the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen, "I have an 
important matter to discuss with you". To Abel: "I am afraid 
there is not much to amuse small children here. I should be obliged 
if you could make other arrangements for your daughters. You may stay 
as long as you wish, of course, but if arranging for the care of the 
girls must take time into account, I think a day or two should be enough 
to finish our business in". To Mark: "Please give my regards 
to Myra".   She signed the letters quickly, stamped them, and 
placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town. Then she 
went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the 
glare on the water.   "My nephews will be coming down", she 
said that evening as Angelina brought her dinner into the dining room, 
the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray. She looked at the girl 
speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years; from the 
early evening lights of them which had first startled Izaak to look 
at 
her in an uncousinly way, they had faded to a near-absence of color which 
had, possibly from her constant looking at the water, something of 
the light of the sea in them.   Angelina placed the tray on the 
table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth. She smiled, 
and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face. "That 
will be so nice for you, Mrs& Packard", she said. Her voice was 
ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in Sicilian brilliance before 
the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose. 
"Um", said the old lady, and brought her eyes down to the tray. 
"You remember them, I suppose"? She glinted suspiciously at the 
dish before her: "Blowfish. I hope Raphael bought them whole".

Angelina stepped back, her eyes roaming the tray for omissions. 
Then she looked at the old woman again, her eyes calm.   "Yes", 
she said, "I remember that they came here every summer. 
I used to play with the older one sometimes, when he'd let me. Abel"? 
The name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips. 
For an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through 
her smile. She would have said triumph. Then Angelina turned and 
with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen.   Jessica Packard 
lifted her head and followed the retreating figure, her eyes resting 
nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips. 
For a moment she held her face to the empty doorway; then she snorted 
and groped for her fork.   There's no greater catastrophe 
in the universe, she reflected dourly, impaling tender green beans 
on the silver fork, than the dwindling away of a family. Procreation, 
expansion, proliferation- these are the laws of living things, with 
the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments: oblivion. 
When the fate of the individual is visited on the group, then (the 
warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed 
her head forward belligerently), ah, then the true bitterness of 
existence could be tasted. And indeed the young garden beans were brackish 
in her mouth.   She was the last living of the older generation. 
What had once been a widespread family- at one time, she knew, 
there were enough Packards to populate an entire county- had now 
narrowed down to the two boys, Abel and Mark. She swung her eyes up 
to the blue of the window, her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans. 
What hope lay in the nephews, she asked the intensifying light out there, 
with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced, having 
sired two girl children, with none to bear on the Packard name?

She ate. It seemed to her, as it seemed each night, that the gloom 
drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs, 
giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows. Here, too, 
she talked low, quirking her head at one or another of the places, 
most often at Izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table. 
Or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed, consciously 
playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early 
years.   She thought again of her children, those two who had 
died young, before the later science which might have saved them could 
attach even a label to their separate malignancies. The girl, her 
first, she barely remembered. It could have been anyone's infant, for 
it had not survived the bassinet. But the boy **h the boy had been 
alive yesterday. Each successive movement in his growing was recorded 
on the unreeling film inside her. He ran on his plump sticks of 
legs, 
freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the 
camera had caught and held on the paling photographs, all carefully placed 
and glued and labeled, resting in the fat plush album in the bottom 
drawer of the escritoire. In the cruel clearness of her memory the 
boy remained unchanged, quick with the delight of laughter, and the pain 
with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable 
to her. It was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water 
on those days when she hated the sea. ##

The brothers drove 
down together in Mark's small red sports car, Mark at the wheel. They 
rarely spoke. Abel sat and regarded the farm country which, spreading 
out from both sides of the road, rolled greenly up to where the 
silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields. 
He saw the land with a stranger's eyes, all the old familiarness 
gone. And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger, 
impervious, complete in itself. There was stability there, too- a 
color which his life had had once. That is what childhood is, he told 
himself. Solid, settled **h lost. In the stiff neutral lines of the 
telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of Aunt Jessica's 
letter. What bad grace, what incredible selfishness he and Mark 
had shown. The boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might 
never have been. They had closed over, absolutely, with the sealing 
of old Izaak's grave. The small car flew on relentlessly. The old 
woman, stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took 
on an ominous reality. Abel moved and adjusted his long legs.

"I suppose it has to do with the property", Mark had said over 
the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters. 
Not until the words had been spoken did Abel suddenly see the old house 
and the insistent sea, and feel his contrition blotted out in one 
shameful moment of covetousness. He and Mark were the last of the family, 
and there lay the Cape Ann property which had seemed to have no 
end, stretching from horizon to horizon, in those golden days of summer.

Now Abel turned his head to look at his brother. Mark held 
the wheel loosely, but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful 
way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd 
make in the years to come. His sandy hair was already beginning 
to thin and recede at the sides, and Abel looked quickly away. Mark 
easily looked years older than himself, settled, his world comfortably 
categorized.   The vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they 
approached the sea. "She didn't mention bringing Myra", Mark 
said, maneuvering the car into the next lane. "She's probably 
getting old- crotchety, I mean- and we figured uh-uh, better not. 
They've never met, you know. But Myra wouldn't budge without 
an express invitation. I feel kind of bad about it". He gave Abel 
a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel, hugging it to him, and 
Abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt.   "I imagine 
the old girl hasn't missed us much", Mark added, his eyes on the 
road. Abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation. He smiled. 
It was barely possible that his brother was right.   He could 
tell they were approaching the sea. The air took on a special strength 
now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind. 
There was the smell of the coast, like a primeval memory, composed 
of equal parts salt water, clams, seaweed and northern air. He turned 
from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye 
again the great fieldstone house which, built on one of the many acres 
of ancestral land bordering the west harbor, had been Izaak's bride-gift 
to his cousin-wife as the last century ended.   Mark's 
thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own, climbing 
the same crags in dirty white sneakers, clambering out on top of the 
headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant. 
"Remember the <Starbird?>" Mark asked, and Abel lifted his 
eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road, the twin white 
ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of 
the hill and came down.   "The <Starbird,>" Abel said. There 
was the day Uncle Izaak had, in an unexpected grandiose gesture, 
handed over the pretty sloop to Abel for keeps, on condition that 
he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy 
wished. The two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team 
**h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth 
and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance 
could. They seemed then to have had a single mind and body, a 
mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth, casually. 
He saw the <Starbird> as she lay, her slender mast up and gently 
turning, its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus 
sky. Both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her 
waiting, ready, for the two of them to run up her sails. The <Starbird> 
had been long at the bottom of the bay.   They came unexpectedly 
upon the sea. Meeting it without preparation as they did, robbed 
of anticipation, a common disappointment seized them. They were 
climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid 
blackness, became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into 
a faint mist of light and ended. Mark stopped the car and switched 
off the lights and they sat looking at the water, which, there being 
no moon out, at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an 
absence of stars. 
His eyes were old and they never saw well, but heated with whisky they'd 
glare at my noise, growing red and raising up his rage. I decided 
I hated the Pedersen kid too, dying in our kitchen while I was away 
where I couldn't watch, dying just to entertain Hans and making 
me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall, Pa lumped under the 
covers at the end like dung covered with snow, snoring and whistling. 
Oh he'd not care about the Pedersen kid. He'd not care about getting 
waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid 
and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain. That would make 
him mad enough if he was sober. I didn't hurry though it was cold 
and the Pedersen kid was in the kitchen.   He was all shoveled 
up like I thought he'd be. I pushed at his shoulder, calling 
his 
name. I think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except 
to roll a little when I shoved him. The covers slid down his skinny 
neck so I saw his head, fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed, but 
his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose 
on the plaster- and I thought, Well you don't look much like 
a pig-drunk bully now. I couldn't be sure he was still asleep. He 
was a cagey sonofabitch. I shook him a little harder and made some noise. 
"Pap-pap-pap-hey", I said.   I was leaning too far over. 
I knew better. He always slept close to the wall so you had to lean 
to reach him. Oh he was smart. It put you off. I knew better but 
I was thinking of the Pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough. 
When his arm came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side of 
the neck, watering my eyes, and I backed off to cough. Pa was on his 
side, looking at me, his eyes winking, the hand that had hit me a fist 
in the pillow.   "Get the hell out of here".   I didn't 
say anything, trying to get my throat clear, but I watched him. 
He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear. It was better, though, 
he'd hit me. He was bitter when he missed.   "Get the 
hell out of here".   "Big Hans sent me. He told me to wake 
you".   "A fat hell on Big Hans. Get out of here".

"He found the Pedersen kid by the crib".   "Get the 
hell out".   Pa pulled at the covers. He was tasting his mouth.

"The kid's froze good. Hans is rubbing him with snow. 
He's got him in the kitchen".   "Pedersen"? 
"No, Pa. It's the Pedersen kid. The kid".   "Nothing 
to steal from the crib".   "Not stealing, Pa. He was just 
lying there. Hans found him froze. That's where he was when Hans 
found him".   Pa laughed.   "I ain't hid nothing in 
the crib".   "You don't understand, Pa. The Pedersen 
kid. The kid"-   "I god damn well understand".   Pa 
had his head up, glaring, his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd 
grown a mustache once.   "I god damn well understand. You 
know I don't want to see Pedersen. That cock. Why should I? What 
did he come for, hey? God dammit, get. And don't come back. 
Find out something. You're a fool. Both you and Hans. Pedersen. 
That cock. Don't come back. Out. Out".   He was shouting 
and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow. He had long 
black hairs on his wrist. They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt.

"Big Hans made me come. Big Hans said"-   "A 
fat hell on Big Hans. He's an even bigger fool than you are. 
Fat, hey? I taught him, dammit, and I'll teach you. Out. You 
want me to drop my pot"?   He was about to get up so I got 
out, slamming the door. He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep. 
Then he threw things. Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot 
over the banister. Pa'd been shit-sick in that pot. Hans got an 
axe. He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part 
of Pa's door down before he stopped. He might not have gone that 
far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house. 
That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it. I 
always felt the memory was present in both of them, stirring in their 
chests like a laugh or a growl, as eager as an animal to be out. I 
heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs.   Hans had laid steaming 
towels over the kid's chest and stomach. He was rubbing snow on 
the kid's legs and feet. Water from the snow and water from the towels 
had run off the kid to the table where the dough was, and the dough 
was turning pasty, sticking to the kid's back and behind.   "Ain't 
he going to wake up"?   "What about your pa"?

"He was awake when I left".   "What'd he say? 
Did you get the whisky"?   "He said a fat hell on Big 
Hans".   "Don't be smart. Did you ask him about the whisky"?

"Yeah".   "Well"?   "He said 
a fat hell on Big Hans".   "Don't be smart. What's 
he going to do"?   "Go back to sleep most likely".

"You'd best get that whisky".   "You go. Take the axe. 
Pa's scared to hell of axes".   "Listen to me, Jorge, 
I've had enough to your sassing. This kid's froze bad. If I don't 
get some whisky down him he might die. You want the kid to die? 
Do you? Well, get your pa and get that whisky".   "Pa 
don't care about the kid".   "Jorge".   "Well 
he don't. He don't care at all, and I don't care to get my head 
busted neither. He don't care, and I don't care to have his shit 
flung on me. He don't care about anybody. All he cares about is 
his whisky and that dry crack in his face. Get pig-drunk- that's 
what he wants. He don't care about nothing else at all. Nothing. 
Not Pedersen's kid neither. That cock. Not the kid neither".

"I'll get the spirits", Ma said.   I'd wound Big 
Hans up tight. I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the 
whisky it surprised him like it surprised me, and he ran down. Ma 
never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off. Not any more. 
Not for years. The first thing every morning when she washed her face 
she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot 
cleat, and maybe she saw him heaving it again, the dirty sock popping 
out as it flew. It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember 
that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while 
he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides.   "No 
you won't", Big Hans said.   "Yes, Hans, if they're 
needed", 
Ma said.   Hans shook his head but neither of us tried 
to stop her. If we had, then one of us would have had to go instead. 
Hans rubbed the kid with more snow **h rubbed **h rubbed.   "I'll 
get more snow", I said. I took the pail and shovel and went 
out on the porch. I don't know where Ma went. I thought she'd 
gone upstairs and expected to hear she had. She had surprised Hans 
like she had surprised me when she said she'd go, and then she surprised 
him again when she came back so quick like she must have, because 
when I 
came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three 
white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat.

Oh, he was being queer and careful, pawing about in the 
drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm. 
He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something 
big, something heroic even, especially for her **h I know him **h 
I know him **h we felt the same sometimes **h while Ma wasn't thinking 
about 
that at all, not anything like that. There was no way of getting 
even. It wasn't like getting cheated at the fair. They were always 
trying so you got to expect it. Now Hans had given Ma something of 
his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa- 
something valuable; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her, 
there was no easy way of getting it back.   Hans cut the foil 
off finally and unscrewed the cap. He was put out too because there 
was only one way of understanding what she'd done. Ma had found one 
of Pa's hiding places. She'd found one and she hadn't said a 
word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all 
winter, every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had 
looked in the privy and found the first one. Pa had a knack for hiding. 
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it. But now Ma. She'd 
found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't 
know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found, 
saying nothing. Pa was sure to find out. Sometimes he didn't 
seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or 
because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't 
hid one after all or had drunk it up. But he'd find out about this 
one because we were using it. A fool could see what was going on. If 
he found out Ma found it- that'd be bad. He took pride in his 
hiding. It was all the pride he had. I guess fooling Hans and me took 
doing. But he didn't figure Ma for much. He didn't figure her 
at all, and if he found out 
**h a woman **h it'd be bad.   Hans 
poured some in a tumbler.   "You going to put more towels on him"?

"No".   "Why not? That's what he needs, 
something warm to his skin, don't he"?   "Not where 
he's froze good. Heat's bad for frostbite. That's why I only 
put towels on his chest and belly. He's got to thaw slow. You ought 
to know that".   Colors on the towels had run.   Ma poked 
her toe in the kid's clothes.   "What are we going to do 
with these"?   Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's 
mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in 
a second it was dripping from his chin.   "Here, help me prop 
him up. I got hold his mouth open".   I didn't want to touch 
him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's 
clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't 
make any move to.   "Come on, Jorge".   "All right".

"Lift, don't shove **h lift".   "O&K&, 
I'm lifting".   I took him by the shoulders. His head flopped 
back. His mouth fell open. The skin on his neck was tight. He 
was cold all right.   "Hold his head up. He'll choke".

"His mouth is open".   "His throat's shut. He'll 
choke".   "He'll choke anyway".   "Hold his 
head up".   "I can't".   "Don't hold him like 
that. Put your arms around him".   "Well Jesus". 
He was cold all right. I put my arm carefully around him. Hans had 
his fingers in the kid's mouth.   "Now he'll choke for sure".

"Shut up. Just hold him like I told you".   He 
was cold all right, and wet. I had my arm behind his back. 
He was in his mid-fifties at this time, long past the establishment of 
his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again, and it was almost 
a decade since he had sworn off lecturing. There was never a doubt 
any more how his structures would be received; it was always the same 
unqualified success now. He could no longer build anything, whether 
a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil, 
without it being obvious that he had done it, and while here and there 
he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique, 
they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the 
public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time, a quality 
of authentic uniqueness about them, which, once established by an 
artist as his private vision, is no longer disputable as to its other 
values. Stowey Rummel was internationally famous, a crafter of a genuine 
Americana in foreign eyes, an original designer whose inventive 
childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere 
by his personality. He had lived for almost thirty years in this 
same stone farmhouse with the same wife, a remarkably childish thing 
in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning, made himself some 
French coffee, had his corn flakes and more coffee, smoked four cigarettes
